    "text": " But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, how many sets do we have? 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 2. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that seems correct. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again, especially for the tens place in the 8's. For the tens place, I considered 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That's correct. So, units place for 8's is 49, tens place is 49, so total 98. For the 4's, units place was 49, tens place 50, hundreds place 89, totaling 188. So, 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488 inclusive. So, 488 -400 +1=89. That's correct. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Hmm, that seems right, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the units place for 4's. Wait, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see: the numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many terms? The first term is 4, the last is 484. The common difference is 10. So, number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in the units place. That's correct. Similarly, for 8's in the units place, same logic: 8,18,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 8 more than 480, which is a multiple of 10. So, (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. So, that's correct. Now, for the tens place, 4's: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, and how many blocks? From 40-49 (1st block), 140-149 (2nd), 240-249 (3rd), 340-349 (4th), 440-449 (5th). Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. That's correct. For the tens place of 8's:80-89,180-189,...,480-488. So, how many blocks? 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, that's correct. Hundreds place for 4's:400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, let's count each block: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me think again. Each hundred block (e.g., 1-100, 101-200, etc.) contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one, which only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, from 1-400, we have four blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So total eights in tens place: 40 +9=49. That matches. 2. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right.

That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems right. And for the tens place, 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. Each full set has 10 numbers, and the last set has 9. So, 4 full sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one partial set (480-488). That's 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place: 8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me check if I counted correctly. For the hundreds place in fours: 400-488. Let's calculate how many numbers that is. 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Correct. For the tens place in fours: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these has 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 5*10=50. Correct. Units place in fours: 4,14,24,...,484. Let's see, 484 is the last one. How many terms? Let's see, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 48 full cycles, but since 484 is included, it's 49 numbers. Correct. So, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total fours:188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total eights:98. Difference:188-98=90.

    "text": " But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count each block. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 2. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer would be 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the units place for fours. When I count units place for fours, from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. That's correct. Similarly, for eights in units place, from 8 to 488, which is (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=49. Correct. For tens place fours: 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, and there are 5 blocks (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449). So, 5*10=50. Correct. For tens place eights: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 blocks, but the last block is only 9 numbers. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Correct. Hundreds place for fours: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. Hundreds place for eights: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488. So, yes, the counts seem accurate. Therefore, the difference is 188 -98=90.

From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. That's 4*10 +9=49, yes. So, total eights are 49+49=98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the units place had 49 eights and the tens place had 49, so total 98. So, eights:98, fours:188.\n\nTherefore, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98.

That's (484 -4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488. That's 488-400 +1=89 numbers. So, 89 fours. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nEights:\n\nUnits place:8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four is 10, last one is 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: none, so 0.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98. Correct.\n\nSo, fours:188, eights:98. Difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems right.\n\nWait, but when I think about the hundreds place, each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's correct. So, 89 fours there.\n\nSo, the total fours are 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nEights:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when counting, especially in the hundreds place, I might have miscounted. Let me confirm the hundreds place for fours again.\n\nFrom 400 to 488: The first number is 400, and the last is 488. So, the count is 488 -400 +1=89. So, 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place in fours: 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is 10, 240-249 is 10, 340-349 is 10, and 440-449 is 10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. Correct.\n\nUnits place fours:4,14,...,484. That's 49 numbers, as calculated earlier. So, 49 fours.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188 fours. Correct.\n\nFor eights, units place:8,18,...,488:49 numbers. Correct.\n\nTens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 49 numbers. Correct.\n\nSo, 49+49=98 eights.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if I made a mistake in the tens place for eights. Let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and then 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 90.

Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. So total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. Wait, but I think I might have missed something. Let me check the tens place for eights again. From 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9.

From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct. So, 89 fours in hundreds place. So, 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89=188. Correct. Eights:49 (units)+49 (tens)=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, especially in the tens place, I might have miscounted the number of sets. Let me check again. For tens place with 8: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 10*4 +9=49. Correct. So, yes, 49 in tens place. So, 98 eights total. So, the difference is indeed 90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. Correct. So, 89 fours in hundreds place. So, yes, 188 fours. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the units place for fours. Let me check again. Units place for fours: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step)+1. So, (484-4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. So, 49 fours in units place. So, all counts seem correct. Therefore, the number of fours exceeds the number of eights by 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we'll count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the units place for numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   - Number of terms:  \n     \\[\n     \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = \\frac{480}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n     \\]  \n   - Total 4's in units place: **49**\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.  \n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place.  \n   - Number of such blocks: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449)  \n   - Total 4's in tens place:  \n     \\[\n     5 \\times 10 = 50\n     \\]  \n   - Total 4's in tens place: **50**\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488.  \n   - Number of terms:  \n     \\[\n     488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n     \\]  \n   - Total 4's in hundreds place: **89**\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 50 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 89 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the units place for numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   - Number of terms:  \n     \\[\n     \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = \\frac{480}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n     \\]  \n   - Total 8's in units place: **49**\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.  \n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except the last block (480-488) which has 9 numbers.  \n   - Number of 8's in tens place:  \n     \\[\n     10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49\n     \\]  \n   - Total 8's in tens place: **49**\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book only goes up to page 488.  \n   - Total 8's in hundreds place: **0**\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 49 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 0 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 98\n\\]\n\n**Calculating the difference:**  \n\\[\n188 \\, (\\text{number of 4's}) - 98 \\, (\\text{number of 8's}) = 90\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recheck the tens place for eights. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, each of the first four sets (80-89, etc.) have 10 numbers, so that's 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so total eights in tens place is 40+9=49. That's correct. Units place: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488-8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, that's correct. So, total eights: 49+49=98. Fours:188. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

From 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Now, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 more eights in the tens place. So, total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 2. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for eights. Let me recount the tens place for eights. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four sets (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49. That seems correct. So, the total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears in the units place for every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). This results in 49 occurrences (from 4 to 484, inclusive).\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each set contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place for every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). This results in 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each complete set contributes 10 occurrences, with the last set (480-488) contributing 9. This totals 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8, as the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
