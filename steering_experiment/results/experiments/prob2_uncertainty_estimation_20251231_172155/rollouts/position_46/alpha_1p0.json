    "text": " Wait, the book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers, not 10. So, let's count each block. From 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 =49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check that again. 0-99: 10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, 10*4 +9=49. Yep, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) -98 (eights) =90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in numbers 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n- Total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).

So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Wait, but let me check the tens place again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4*10 +9=49. So, units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, total eights:49+49=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. For eights, in the hundreds place, none, since 800 is beyond 488. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in the tens place for eights? Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. That's 4 times 10 plus 9, which is 49. So, units:49, tens:49, total:98. Yes, that seems right. For fours, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89, total:188. So, 188-98=90.

So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-488: that's 9 numbers because 488 is the last page, so from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check that again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total is 10*4 +9 =40 +9=49.

So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each part again.\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Units place: 49. That's correct because from 4,14,...,484, which is 484/10 =48.4, so 49 numbers.\n\n- Tens place: 50.

So, 5 sets, 10 each, 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nTotal fours: 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units place: 49. From 8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, plus 1 is 49.\n\n- Tens place: 49. As calculated earlier, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) and 9 in 480-488. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nSo, difference is 188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct.

    "text": " Wait, the book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, how many sets of 10 are there where the tens digit is 8? Let's see: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, total eights in tens place: 49. Hmm, but wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me check the calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me think again about the tens place for eights. When I considered 480-488, I counted 9 numbers, which is correct. But let me make sure that in the tens place, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8, so each of those 9 numbers contributes an 8 in the tens place. So, that's correct. Similarly, in the units place, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, yes, 49 units and 49 tens, totaling 98 eights. And fours are 188. So, the difference is 90. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets do we have? From 0-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four sets (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, but the last set (480-488) has only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets with 10 eights each, and one set with 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, seems correct. But wait, let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. And for the tens place, 40-49, 140-149, etc., each block of 100 has 10 fours in the tens place, and there are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but in the last block, 400-488, the tens digit 4 goes up to 449, right? Because 450-488 don't have a 4 in the tens place. Wait, no, 400-488 includes 400-449 and 450-488. So, in the tens place, 400-449 would have 50 numbers where the tens digit is 4, but wait, no. Wait, in each block of 100, like 400-499, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But since our book stops at 488, the last block is 400-488. So, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, right? Because 440-449 is within 400-488. So, that's 10 numbers. So, in the tens place, for the 400-488 block, it's 10 fours. So, overall, the tens place for fours is 5 blocks of 10, which is 50. So, that's correct. Similarly, for the units place, 488 is included, so that's 49 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights, units place: 49, tens place:49, so total 98. So, 188-98=90.

So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, as 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So total 10*4 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For the tens place of 8's, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers. Let me check: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers, correct. So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. For the units place, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 units and 49 tens, totaling 98 eights. For fours, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89, totaling 188. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. For eights: Units place:8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10. Number of terms: ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks is 10 numbers, the last is 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.
