Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, but does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, 449 is less than 488, so it's fine. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Correct. - Hundreds place: 400-488. 488 -400 +1=89. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. Now, the 8's: units place:8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89 (10),180-189 (10),280-289 (10),380-389 (10),480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me just think if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, I could calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position separately and sum them up, which is what I did. Another way is to consider that for each position, the number of times a digit appears can be calculated based on higher and lower digits. But in this case, since the upper limit is 488, which isn't a round number, the calculation for the hundreds place is a bit different. Wait, in the hundreds place, when counting 4's, we go up to 488, which is 88 numbers after 400, so 89 numbers. For 8's, since 800 is beyond 488, there are none. So, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No pages from 800-899, so 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Similarly, for 8's, in the tens place, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 49 in total. So, yes, 98 eights. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be 90, but I want to make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me try another approach to verify. Alternatively, I can think about how many digits are there in total, but that might not help. Alternatively, I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each position again to confirm. Let me list the positions again. For 4's: Units:4,14,...,484: total 49. Tens:40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449: each 10, so 5*10=50. Hundreds:400-488:89. Total:49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units:8,18,...,488:49. Tens:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488: each 10 except the last one which is 9, so 4*10 +9=49. Hundreds:0. Total:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. I think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

From 400-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-9, so the 4 in the tens place occurs in 400-409, 440-449, etc. Wait, no, in each hundred, the tens digit cycles. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is entirely within 488. So, in the hundreds place, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, the tens digit 4 occurs 5 times in the first four hundreds (0-400), each contributing 10, so 5*10=50.

Hmm, so the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this, maybe using a formula or something. Alternatively, I could consider each digit position separately and calculate the number of times each digit appears. For the units digit: In numbers from 1 to N, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place is floor((N + 1)/10) if d !=0, else floor(N/10). Wait, but maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, for each digit position, the number of times a digit appears can be calculated based on higher digits and lower digits. But in this case, since we're dealing with a specific digit (4 and 8), maybe it's easier to count as I did before. Alternatively, I could use the formula for digit counting. Let me try that for the units place. For units digit 4: The number of times 4 appears in the units place is floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is greater than 4, we add 1, so 49. Similarly for 8: floor(488/10)=48, and since 488 mod 10=8, which is equal to 8, so we add 1, making it 49. So that matches my earlier count. For the tens place: The number of times 4 appears in the tens place. The formula is a bit more involved. The number of times a digit d appears in the tens place is calculated as follows: Let higher = number formed by digits higher than tens place. Let current = tens digit. Let lower = number formed by digits lower than tens place. The count is higher * 10^(number of lower digits) + if current > d: 10^(number of lower digits), else if current == d: lower + 1, else 0. Wait, maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, for the tens place, each complete block of 100 contributes 10 times the digit. So, for 4 in tens place, from 0-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each 100 numbers, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, actually, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88. So, in each of the first four hundreds (0-399), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times each, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8. So, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total is 40 +10=50, which matches my earlier count. Similarly, for 8 in the tens place: Each hundred block contributes 10 times 8 in the tens place. So, for 0-399, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So total is 40 +9=49, which matches my earlier count. For the hundreds place: For 4, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. For 8, the hundreds digit is 8 would start at 800, but since our book ends at 488, there are none. So, that's 0. So, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188. Total 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n1. **Counting the number of '4's:**\n   - **Units place:** The digit '4' appears in the units place every 10 numbers, from 4 to 484. This gives 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit '4' appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of '8's:**\n   - **Units place:** The digit '8' appears in the units place every 10 numbers, from 8 to 488. This gives 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit '8' appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last set being 480-488, giving 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with '8' in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - The number of '4's exceeds the number of '8's by 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " That's (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 =48 +1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct. Now for 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188 -98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers. From 4 to 484, there are (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit '4' appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400 to 488, there are 89 numbers with '4' in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** The digit '8' appears every 10 numbers. From 8 to 488, there are (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit '8' appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 10 each, and the last block 480-488 contributes 9. Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No occurrence since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:**\n   - Subtract the number of '8's from '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " That's 484/10 = 48.4, which we rounded up to 49. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. For the 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, plus 1 is 49. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
