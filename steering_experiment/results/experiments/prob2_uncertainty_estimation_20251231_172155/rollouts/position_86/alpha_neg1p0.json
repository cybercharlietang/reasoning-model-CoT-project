This is every 10th number starting from 4 up to 484. The count is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488. The count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 times.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 times.\n\n2. **Count the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The count is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges each contribute 10 numbers, and the last range (480-488) contributes 9 numbers. So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488. Count = 0.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 times.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

The first four ranges each contribute 10 numbers, and the last range contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit '8' does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.\n\nAdding these up: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98 occurrences of '8'.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\nThus, there are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
