    "text": " So, that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, in the tens place, we have 49 eights. So, 49 units, 49 tens, 0 hundreds. So, 98 eights in total. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to miscount, especially in the hundreds place. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position separately. For the 4's: Units place: every 10 numbers, so 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48, but wait, that would be up to 480. Then from 481 to 488, the units digit 4 appears at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, for 488, we have 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 400-488. Wait, no, 400-488 is part of the 400-499 range, but we only go up to 488. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 0-399, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for numbers 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 400-488 includes 440-449, so that's another 10. So, total tens place fours:40+10=50. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 50, so that's correct. Now, hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Same as before. For the 8's: Units place: same as before, 49. Tens place: In each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers. So, from 0-399, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place:4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights:40+9=49. Hundreds place: 800-899, but we only go up to 488, so 0. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, I think my initial calculation was correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, it's easy to make an off-by-one error. Let me verify the units place for 4's: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 4 +10(n-1)=484. So, 10(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. Correct, so 49 fours in units place. Similarly, for 8's in units place: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. 8 +10(n-1)=488. 10(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, n=49. Correct. So, units place for both 4 and 8 is 49 each. Tens place for 4's: 5 sets of 10, so 50. Tens place for 8's: 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers, so 49. Hundreds place: 4's have 89, 8's have 0. So, 188 vs 98, difference 90.
