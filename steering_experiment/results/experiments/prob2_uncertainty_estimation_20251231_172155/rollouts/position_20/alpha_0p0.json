    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Let's count how many such sets there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 goes up to 449, which is within 488. So, how many sets are there? 0-99: 1 set, 100-199: 1 set, 200-299: 1 set, 300-399: 1 set, 400-488: 1 set (440-449). That's a total of 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count the sets: 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189 is another 10. 200-299: 280-289 is another 10. 300-399: 380-389 is another 10. 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 full sets (each with 10) and one partial set with 9. So, total in tens place: 4 * 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in sets like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 occurrences, with 5 such sets.\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in sets like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each full set contributes 10, with an additional 9 in the last partial set.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Each group has 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 fours in the tens place. How many such groups are there? From 40-49, that's one group; then 140-149 is another, 240-249 another, 340-349 another, and 440-449 another. That's 5 groups. So, 5 groups \u00d7 10 numbers = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 count as a full group? Since the book goes up to 488, 449 is within 488, so yes, that's a full group. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me check: 400 to 488 is indeed 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. To find how many, I can divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 0, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, 8, 18, ..., 488: that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me count how many such groups there are. Each group has 10 numbers, contributing 10 eights in the tens place. How many groups? 80-89 is one, 180-189 another, 280-289 another, and 380-389 another. That's 4 groups. So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-489 would be another group, but since the book only goes up to 488, does that affect the count? Let me check: 480-488 is part of the 480-489 group. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Each of these has an 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 more eights in the tens place. So, total in tens place is 4 groups \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: The tens place 8 can be in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 5 groups. The first four groups are complete (each has 10 numbers), but the last group (480-488) has 9 numbers. So, total eights in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, but earlier I thought the tens place had 49 eights, so total eights would be 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 188. For eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. That seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4, 14, ..., 484. This gives 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. This gives 5 groups \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, giving 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8, 18, ..., 488. This gives 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. This gives 4 complete groups (40) and 9 additional in 480-488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, each subsequent block is 100 apart. The last block before 488 would be 440-449. So, how many blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (1 block), 100-199: 140-149 (another block), 200-299: 240-249 (another), 300-399: 340-349 (another), and 400-488: 440-449 (another). So that's 5 blocks in total. Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But we're only concerned with the hundreds digit. In each of these numbers, the hundreds digit is 4. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me think: from 400-488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's indeed 89 fours. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me check how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so it's actually 49 numbers. Wait, 8, 18, ..., 488. Let me count: from 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, from 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. So, how many blocks are there? From 0-99: 80-89 (1 block), 100-199: 180-189 (another), 200-299: 280-289 (another), 300-399: 380-389 (another), and 400-488: 480-488 (another). So, that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last block, which is only 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no: 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 eights in the tens place for that block. So, the first four blocks contribute 10 eights each, and the fifth block contributes 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Now, subtracting the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

Each set of ten numbers (e.g., 40-49) has 10 fours in the tens place. Now, how many such sets are there up to 488? The first set is 40-49, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets. Each set contributes 10 fours, so 5 x 10 = 50 fours. However, we need to check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me check each set. - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights. - 180-189: another 10 eights. - 280-289: 10 eights. - 380-389: 10 eights. - 480-488: Here, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 9 eights in the tens place. So total eights in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

Now, how many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers) From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers) From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers) From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to fours, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count how many such ranges: From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers) From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers) From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). Now, from 400-488: The next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, the tens place for 8: 4 ranges with 10 each and one range with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no hundreds digits of 8 in the page numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the last set would be 440-449, because 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, and 480-488 don't have a 4 in the tens place except for 480-488, but 480-488 have 8 in the tens place, not 4. So, let's see how many full groups of 100 we have. From 1-488, the hundreds digits go up to 4. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so that's 5 groups. So, 5 times 10 is 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. That's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). But wait, 488 is the last page, so from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so we take 48 full groups, which would be up to 480, but 488 is included. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The first is 8, the last is 488. To find how many terms, we can use the formula: ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count these: - 80-89: 10 numbers, but since the book goes up to 488, 80-89 is fully included. So, 10 eights. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: here, the tens digit is 8, and the numbers go from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 eights. Adding these up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights here. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. That's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let's see: 8, 18, ..., 488. Yes, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit can be 8 only up to 488. So, let's check each range: - 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). - 100-199: 180-189 (10). - 200-299: 280-289 (10). - 300-399: 380-389 (10). - 400-488: The tens digit can be 8, so 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, we have 4 ranges with 10 numbers each and one range with 9 numbers. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, seems right. But let me check the tens place for 4's again. From 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 5 ranges each with 10, so 50. That's correct. For 8's in the tens place, in 400-488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Units place for both 4 and 8 have 49 each? Wait, for 4's in units place, I thought it was 49, but let me confirm. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, and then an extra 4 in 484. So, 48 +1=49. Correct. Similarly, for 8's in units place, same logic: 48 full cycles, and 488 is included, so 49. Correct. So, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n1. **Counting the number of '4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n   - **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n   - **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488).\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of '8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n   - **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n   - **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, that's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). But wait, how many hundreds digits are 4 in this range? Each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 numbers. But wait, 488 is the last page, so from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers. So, starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but including 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, 8, 18, ..., 488. Let's check: 8 is the 1st, 18 is the 2nd, ..., 488 is the 49th. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. So, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the 480-489 block. So, how many blocks? From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, that's 9 numbers, not 10. So, for the tens place, we have 4 blocks with 10 eights each, and one block with 9 eights. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me double-check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, same for 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 4 full blocks of 10 and one partial block of 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights = 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, total fours = 188, total eights = 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the fours: units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct. Now, eights: units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again about the tens place for 4's. I had 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each has 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50. That seems correct. For eights, in the tens place, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, 4 x 10 + 9 = 49. That's correct. Units place for both 4 and 8: 49 each. So, yes, 4's have 188, 8's have 98, difference is 90. Hmm, seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is the 49th? Let me think again. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, the number of 4's in the units place is the number of complete decades plus any extra. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 fours. But wait, 484 is within the 480-489 range, which is the 49th decade, but since we only go up to 488, we still have 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, I think it's 49 fours in the units place. Hmm, maybe I should approach it differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place up to N can be calculated as floor((N + 1) / 10). So, for 488, (488 + 1) / 10 = 489 / 10 = 48.9, which floors to 48. So, 48 fours in the units place. Wait, but 484 is included, so maybe it's 49. Hmm, perhaps I should list them. From 4 to 484, stepping by 10: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10 => 480 = (n-1)*10 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, 49 fours in the units place. Okay, so units place: 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges exist up to 488. The first is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each contributes 10 fours in the tens place. How many such ranges are there? From 0 to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. For each hundred, there's a 40-49 range. So, for hundreds digit 0: 40-49 (10 fours). Hundreds digit 1: 140-149 (10 fours). Hundreds digit 2: 240-249 (10 fours). Hundreds digit 3: 340-349 (10 fours). Hundreds digit 4: 440-449 (10 fours). So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place: 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, hundreds place: 89 fours. Now, total number of fours is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Hmm, okay, maybe that's correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to fours, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? Let's see. The last one is 488, which is 8 in the units place. Using the same method as before: (488 + 1)/10 = 489/10=48.9, which floors to 48. So, 48 eights in the units place. Alternatively, the nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. Let's see when it's <=488. 8 + (n-1)*10 <=488 => (n-1)*10 <=480 => n-1<=48 => n<=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. Wait, but 488 is included, so it's 49. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Each of these ranges has 10 eights in the tens place. Let's see how many such ranges exist up to 488. The first is 80-89 (10 eights). Then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, for 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but the units digit goes from 0 to 8, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, each range except the last one contributes 10 eights, and the last one contributes 9. So, how many ranges? Hundreds digit 0: 80-89 (10 eights). Hundreds digit 1: 180-189 (10 eights). Hundreds digit 2: 280-289 (10 eights). Hundreds digit 3: 380-389 (10 eights). Hundreds digit 4: 480-488 (9 eights). So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, tens place: 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, total number of eights is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Wait, so fours: 188, eights:98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, in the tens place for fours, I had 5 ranges (0-4 hundreds), each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. That seems correct.\n\nFor eights, in the tens place, I had 4 full ranges (0-3 hundreds) contributing 10 each, and the 4th hundred (400-488) contributing 9 because 480-488 is only 9 numbers. So, 4*10 + 9=49. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place: fours had 49, eights had 49 as well. So, 49+50+89=188 fours, and 49+49=98 eights. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. That's correct.\n\nFor eights, in the hundreds place, none, since 800 is beyond 488. So, 0 eights there.\n\nSo, total fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal eights:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first thought about the units place for fours, I considered 484 as the last one, which is correct. Similarly, for eights, the last units place is 488, which is included, so 49 eights in units.\n\nWait, but let me think about the tens place for eights again. The range 480-488: the tens digit is 8, so numbers are 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place for that range. So, 4 full hundreds (0-3) with 10 each, plus 9 in the 4th hundred. So, 4*10 +9=49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for fours in the tens place, the 4th hundred is 400-488, but the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's included in the 5*10=50.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of '4's:**\n1. **Units place:** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers. From 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit '4' appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges (0-4 hundreds), each contributing 10 '4's, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit '4' appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of '8's:**\n1. **Units place:** The digit '8' appears every 10 numbers. From 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit '8' appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full ranges (0-3 hundreds) contributing 10 each, and 9 in the 4th hundred (480-488), totaling 49.\n\nTotal '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** 90 more '4's are printed than '8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is okay because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them all up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The last one is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this range. Let me count how many ranges: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit from the right):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit from the right):** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit from the right):** 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens Place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. The last range is 480-488, contributing 9 numbers. Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's minus number of '8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. A 4 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then, 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 include 440 to 449? Yes, that's 10 numbers. So, total 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but I need to make sure that 488 is included. Yes, 488 is the last page, so 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. So, total 188 fours. Now, I need to count the number of 8's in the same way. Let's go through each digit position again: 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many such numbers? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: starting at 8, each 10 numbers adds another 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, the number of 8's in the units place is 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let me count each range: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total tens place 8's: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. Wait, that's 49. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10*4 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, when I calculated the number of fours in the units place, I thought 484 is the last one, which is the 49th occurrence. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is indeed the last 4 in the units place before that. So, 49 fours in units place is correct.\n\nIn the tens place for fours, I had 5 ranges (40-49, 140-149, etc.) up to 440-449, which is 5*10=50. That seems correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. That seems right.\n\nFor the eights, units place: 49, correct. Tens place: 49, correct. Hundreds place: 0, correct. So, 98 eights.\n\n188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for eights again. The ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, 5 ranges. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, and the last one has 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for fours in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, correct.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers have one 8. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. Wait, 8, 18, ..., 488: from 8 to 488, how many numbers? Let me calculate: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be another block, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count the blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last block, which only goes up to 488, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so only 9 eights in the tens place for that block. So, the first four blocks contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights, and the fifth block contributes 9 eights. So total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

Let's see how many complete sets of 100 there are in 488. There are four complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. In each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So that's 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40 fours. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 from 440-449. That's another 10 fours. So total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is 488, which is the 49th number because 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's check how many complete sets of 100 there are in 488. There are four complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. In each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers. So that's 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40 eights. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 only from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. Wait, but 480-489 is 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so that's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, the last partial hundred contributes 9 eights. Therefore, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no hundreds digits of 8 in the page numbers. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds place is 4 for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but 400-488 includes 400, so yes, 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of fours is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The last number is 488, which is 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but let's check if 488 is included. 488 is 48*10 + 8, so yes, it's the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers. Let's see how many such ranges are within 488. From 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-489, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count how many numbers that is: 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only for 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4 ranges with 10 each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one range with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of eights is 98. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488), totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., but only 9 in the last range (480-488). Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Let me count how many such sets there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But again, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The count is floor(488/10) + 1 if the last number is included. Wait, 488 is 48*10 + 8, so it's included. So, the number of 8's in the units place is 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the tens place because the tens digit is 8. Let me count each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights in the tens place. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: here, the tens digit is 8, but the units digits go from 0 to 8, so that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 numbers here. So, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as pages go up to 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place. How many hundreds are there up to 488? Let's see: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. That's 5 sets. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 400-488: 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is okay because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. How many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but we have to check if 488 is included. 8 \u00d7 61 = 488, so the last number is 488, which is the 61st occurrence? Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, the number of such numbers is equal to the number of times 8 appears in the units place. The formula is floor(488 / 10) + 1 if the last number is included. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so floor is 48, but since 488 is included, we add 1, making it 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, instead of 10, we have 9 numbers in the 400-488 range. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (from 0-399) and 9 in 400-488. So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the Number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10 numbers.\n   - Total ranges: 5 (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n   - Total occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the Number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contributing 10 numbers, except the last range which has 9 numbers (480-488).\n   - Total occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers in the book have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, 49 fours in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, contributing 10 fours. From 100-199: 140-149 is another, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many ranges? From 0-99: 1 range. 100-199: 1. 200-299:1. 300-399:1. 400-488:1. So that's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, and then 8 more in the last partial decade. Wait, but 488 is included, so the count would be 49 numbers: 8,18,...,488. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count the ranges: 0-99: 80-89 is one range, 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189, another 10. 200-299: 280-289, another 10. 300-399: 380-389, another 10. 400-488: Would there be an 80-89 in the 400s? No, because 480-489 would be the next, but 488 is the last page. So, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, but wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. But wait, in the tens place, 8 can appear in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, in the hundreds place 4, the tens place 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, total ranges with full 10 eights: 0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399: four ranges, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers, contributing 9 eights in the tens place. So total eights in tens place: 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Let's count how many numbers in each set. - 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nWait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is okay because 449 is less than 488.

Let's see how many numbers that is. 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's the number of times 4 appears every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 fours. Tens place: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9, so in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49).

So, let's see:\n\n- 1-99: tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 100-199: 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 200-299: 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 300-399: 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 400-488: 40-49 would be 400-409, 410-419,... up to 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. Wait, but in the hundreds place, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, etc., but actually, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, 480-489. But since we're only going up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many full tens are there? Let's see:\n\nFrom 400-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8 (since 488 is the last). So, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, 480-488. Wait, but the tens digit being 4 occurs when the tens digit is 4, so in 400-409, 410-419, etc. But wait, in 400-409, the tens digit is 0, so that's not 4. Wait, I think I'm confusing the hundreds and tens digits. Let me clarify: The hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488, but the tens digit is 4 in numbers where the tens place is 4, regardless of the hundreds digit. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 404-409, 414-419, 424-429, 434-439, 444-449, 454-459, 464-469, 474-479, 484-488. Wait, but that's not correct. Actually, the tens digit is 4 in numbers like 404, 414, 424, etc., up to 484. So, for each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, from 1-488, how many times does the tens digit equal 4? Let's calculate:\n\n- 1-99: 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 100-199: 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 200-299: 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 300-399: 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 400-488: 400-409: 10 numbers (but wait, 400-409 is part of the 400s, but the tens digit is 0 in 400-409, so actually, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, but wait, no, that's the hundreds digit. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me approach this differently. For the tens digit being 4, it occurs in every block of 100 numbers, 10 times. So, from 1-400, how many times does the tens digit equal 4? It's 4 times 10, which is 40. Then, from 401-488, how many times does the tens digit equal 4? The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, 440-449 is fully included, so that's another 10. So, total tens digit 4's: 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 50, so that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. Now, hundreds place: 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the units digit. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because it's 8 in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488)\n\nSo, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0.\n\nTotal eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights.\n\nWait, let me double-check the tens place for eights. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in:\n\n- 80-89: 10\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9\n\nSo, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. That seems right. And in the tens place, 50 fours, units 49. So, 89+50=139, plus 49 is 188. For eights, units 49, tens 49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. Yes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, the last range is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such ranges are there? Let's see: 80-89 is within 488, 180-189 is also within, 280-289, 380-389. The next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, only 480-488 are valid. So, that's 9 numbers instead of 10. So, how many ranges? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, let's see how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one block. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 blocks * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, checking each digit position: 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing an 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. Now, let's see how many such blocks are within 488. From 0-99: 80-89 is one block. From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. From 400-488: The next block would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, we have 4 blocks of 10 (from 80-89 up to 380-389) and one partial block from 480-488. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks * 10 = 40, plus 9 in the partial block, totaling 49. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, each block from 80-89, etc., is 10 numbers, so 4 full blocks give 40, and the last partial block from 480-488 is 9 numbers, so total 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 1-400, there are four blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's the fifth block. So, each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, so that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so that's 89 fours. Wait, no, that's not right. The hundreds digit is 4 in the hundreds place for each number from 400 to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, so yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours printed are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the 8's, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so we take the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 occurrences. Wait, 488 is the 49th 8 in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, there are four blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. The next block would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that block is only up to 488. So, in 480-488, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. Wait, but 480 has 8 in the tens place? Wait, 480 is 4 8 0, so yes, the tens digit is 8. So, in the 480-489 block, we have 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights printed are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but since the book only goes up to 488, the range is 480-488. So, let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, because 488-480+1=9). So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds places with 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 480-489 isn't fully included since we stop at 488. Let me calculate how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, from 1-488, how many complete blocks of 100 are there? There are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these blocks contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40. Then, in the 401-488 range, the tens place is 4 for 40-49 in each hundred, but here it's 40-49 in the 400s. So, from 400-488, the tens place is 4 for 10 numbers (400-409, but wait, 400-409 is 10 numbers, but in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (400-409). So, that's another 10. Wait, but 400-488 includes 400-409, 410-419, etc., up to 480-488. So, the tens digit is 4 only in 400-409, which is 10 numbers. So, adding that, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 40 (from the first four hundreds) plus 10 (from 400-409) = 50. Wait, but 400-409 is part of the 400s, which is the fifth hundred, right? So, maybe I should think of it as 5 blocks, but the fifth block isn't complete. Hmm, maybe a better approach is to calculate how many times 4 appears in the tens place up to 488. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, for each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (400-409), but wait, 400 is included in the 401-488 range? No, 400 is part of the 400-499 range, but our book ends at 488. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only from 400-409, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 fours. So, total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of fours is 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many terms? The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The nth term can be found by 8 + 10(n-1) = 488. So, 10(n-1) = 480, so n-1 = 48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (480-489), but our book ends at 488, so it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, that's 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the tens place, we have 40 (from 1-400) plus 9 (from 480-488) = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of eights is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through the fours again. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. The last term is 484, which is 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So, 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, n=49. Correct. Tens place: From 1-400, 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, which is 10 numbers. So, 40+10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 8 + 10*(n-1)=488. So, 10*(n-1)=480, n-1=48, n=49. Correct. Tens place: From 1-400, 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights, so 40. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, total eights: 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, especially in the tens place for 480-488, I might have miscounted. Let me check that again. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, and there are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but the tens place for 440-449 is still 10 numbers. So, that's okay. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, hundreds place has 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number is 488. So, how many such numbers are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so we take 48, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many ranges? From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last. So, for the tens place, each hundred except the last one has 10 eights, and the last hundred has 9. So, 4 hundreds with 10 each and 1 with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract 98 from 188: 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " Wait, let me double-check. The formula for counting how many times a digit appears in a specific place is usually floor((n + 1) / 10) for the units place. So, for 488, it would be (488 + 1)/10 = 489/10 = 48.9, which we take the floor of, giving 48. Hmm, so maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me think again. The number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488 is actually the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra numbers. Each decade contributes exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many decades are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. But wait, the 48th decade is 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so does that affect the count? Let's see: from 1 to 488, the last decade is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the units place, 480-488 includes 484, which is a 4 in the units place. So, in the 48th decade, we still have one 4 in the units place at 484. So, that's 48 occurrences. So, units place has 48 fours. Wait, but earlier I thought 484 would be the 49th, but maybe not because we start counting from 4 as the first. Let me list them: 4,14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94,104,...,484. How many are there? Let's see, from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that's 49 numbers. So, maybe I was right the first time. Hmm, perhaps the formula I recalled was incorrect. Let me think again. The formula for counting the number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to number N is floor(N/10) if we're looking for d in 0-9, but actually, it's a bit different. Let me think of it as for each digit place, the count is based on higher digits and the current digit. For units place, the count is determined by the higher digits. For example, in units place, for each higher number, every 10 numbers contribute one 4. So, up to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The number of complete decades is 48 (since 488/10=48.8), so 48 times, but since 488 is beyond 480, we have an additional 4 in the units place at 484. So, total is 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place: 49 fours. Okay, moving on. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, total tens place fours: 5*10=50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, inclusive. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** How many times does 8 appear in the units place up to 488? Similar to the 4's, it's every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's count how many. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But our book ends at 488, so the last range is 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except possibly the last one. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9=40+9=49. Wait, no. Let me check again. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 full decades and one partial. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place eights:49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 8 in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place eights:0. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=49+49=98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. Difference:188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think of it as for each ten numbers, there's one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many tens are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens and then 8 extra numbers. Each full ten contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial ten (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so no 4 in the units place. Wait, but 484 is 484, which is 48*10 + 4, so that would be the 48th occurrence, right? So, maybe the count is 48. Hmm, I'm getting confused here. Let me try another approach. For the units digit, the number of 4's is equal to the number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. So, in each set of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, there are 480 numbers, which is 48 sets of 10. So, 48 fours in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, that's 8 numbers, and the units digits go from 1 to 8, so no 4. So, total units place 4's: 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one range, contributing 10 fours. From 100-199: 140-149 is another range, another 10 fours. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, that's five ranges, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, in each set of 10 numbers, there's one 8 in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many full tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens. Each contributes one 8, so 48. Then, from 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, total units place 8's: 48 +1=49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count the ranges. From 1-99: 80-89 is one range, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. Now, 400-488: The next would be 480-489, but 489 is beyond 488, so only up to 488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. Wait, so does that count as a full range? Let me think. From 480-488, that's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, for the tens place, we have four full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 10 each, so 4*10=40. Then, the partial range 480-488 contributes 9 eights. So, total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place. But in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 in the hundreds place would be 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, number of 4's is 187, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 -98=89. So, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - In every set of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of 10, contributing 48 fours.\n   - The last partial set (481-488) doesn't include a 4 in the units place.\n   - Total units place 4's: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - There are five such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 fours.\n   - Total tens place 4's: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - Total hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 488, 48 full sets of 10 contribute 48 eights.\n   - The last partial set (481-488) includes 488, which has an 8 in the units place.\n   - Total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - There are four full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 eights.\n   - The range 480-488 contributes 9 eights.\n   - Total tens place 8's: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **89**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 fours. From 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 fours. From 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 fours. From 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 fours. From 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 fours. So, total blocks are 5, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this block. Each block except the last one contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's see: From 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 eights. From 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 eights. From 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 eights. From 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 eights. From 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 eights (since 488 is the last page). So, total eights in the tens place: 4 blocks with 10 each and 1 block with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can only appear in the hundreds place if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there? From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? Let's subtract 400 from 488 and add 1: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction, we take 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, every 10 numbers add one. So, 8, 18, ..., 488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's see how many numbers are in each range: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, total eights in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds places with 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place (ones place):** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 count? Since the book goes up to 488, 449 is within 488, so yes, it's valid. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, let me confirm: 400 is the first, 401, 402, ..., up to 488. So, yes, that's 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours.

From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, total tens place 8's: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 in 480-488. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place.

Each block has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 40-49: that's one block. Then, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's a total of 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is only up to 449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total.

Now, 480-489 would be the next block, but since the book only goes up to 488, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, how many full blocks are there? 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, the partial block 480-488 contributes 9 eights. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can only be 4 in this case, since the book goes up to 488.

Similarly, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets of 10 numbers each, giving 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 include 440 to 449? Yes, that's 10 numbers. So, 5 sets, so 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but let me check: 400, 401, ..., 488. So, that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them all up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, does 488 count? Yes, because 488 ends with an 8. So, let's see how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-489 would only go up to 488. So, let's count these. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: that's 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, let me check: 480 to 488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9. So, for the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. Wait, actually, each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-400, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8, so no additional fours in the tens place. So, total tens place fours are 40. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (400-488 inclusive). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, let me add up all the fours: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 40 = 89, 89 + 89 = 178. So, there are 178 fours in total. Now, I'll do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The last number is 488, so how many are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full occurrences, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences. From 1-488, there are 4 full hundreds, so 4*10=40 eights in the tens place. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8, so 480-488 has the tens digit as 8. That's 9 numbers: 480-488, but wait, 488 is included. So, how many numbers are there? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's an additional 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights are 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights are 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more fours than eights. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 178 - 98 = 80. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, checking the fours:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. Wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only up to 449. From 450-488, the tens digit isn't 4. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. Wait, earlier I thought 4 blocks, but actually, from 0-400, it's 400/100=4 blocks, but 400-488 includes another block where the tens digit is 4 (440-449). So, actually, 5 blocks. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but earlier I thought 40. So, that's an error. Let me correct that. So, units place:49, tens place:50, hundreds place:89. Total fours:49+50=99, 99+89=188. Hmm, that's different from before. So, I think I made a mistake earlier in counting the tens place for fours. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, when counting the tens place for fours, the blocks are:\n\n- 0-99: 40-49:10 fours\n\n- 100-199:140-149:10 fours\n\n- 200-299:240-249:10 fours\n\n- 300-399:340-349:10 fours\n\n- 400-488:440-449:10 fours (since 440-449 is within 400-488)\n\nSo, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5*10=50. So, tens place fours are 50, not 40 as I initially thought. So, total fours:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nNow, checking the eights:\n\n- Units place:8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488-8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, 9 eights. So, total tens place eights:40+9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: none, as before.\n\nSo, total eights:49 (units)+49 (tens)=98.\n\nNow, the difference is 188 fours -98 eights=90. Wait, that's different from my initial calculation. Hmm, I think I made a mistake in the tens place for fours earlier. Let me confirm again.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place for fours, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place, as I corrected, it's 5 blocks of 10, so 50 fours.\n\nUnits place:49 fours.\n\nSo, total fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nEights:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 178-98=80, but that was before correcting the tens place. So, now I think the correct difference is 90. But let me double-check the tens place for fours again.\n\nWait, in the range 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's correct. So, from 0-488, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449: that's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours in the tens place. So, total fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nEights:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but I'm confused because earlier I thought the answer was 80, but now it's 90. Let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400-488, how many numbers? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nTens place:50 fours.\n\nUnits place:49 fours.\n\nTotal fours:188.\n\nEights:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nDifference:90.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** None, as pages go up to 488.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full groups of 10, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except possibly the last one if it doesn't complete 10 numbers. Let's see: From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, each of the first four blocks gives 10 eights, and the last block gives 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

From 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). But wait, how many hundreds digits are 4 in this range? The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Now, from 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10. From 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10. From 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10. From 400-488: Let's see, 480-489 would be the next range, but since the book ends at 488, we only have 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, adding up: 4 ranges with 10 each (from 0-399) and one range with 9. So, that's 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

Each of these blocks has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place only in the numbers 400-488. That's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these numbers has a 4. So, how many fours is that? 89 fours. Wait, no, actually, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add them up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear every 10 numbers. From 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers add one. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except the last one which has only 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, let's count the blocks: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9. So, that's 4 blocks with 10 and 1 block with 9. So, total eights in tens place: (4 * 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Therefore, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units place:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. For eights in the tens place, I considered up to 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 4 blocks of 10 and 1 of 9, totaling 49. That seems right. Units place for eights: from 8 to 488, every 10 numbers, so 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place eights:49. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, from 1 to 488, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 1-100: 40-49 (10 numbers) 101-200: 140-149 (10 numbers) 201-300: 240-249 (10 numbers) 301-400: 340-349 (10 numbers) 401-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in units place? The last one is 484, which is 484/10 = 48.4, so 48 full tens, but since 484 is included, it's 49 numbers. So units: 49. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each hundred has 10, and from 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, 440-449 is another 10, so total 40+10=50. So tens: 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So hundreds:89. Total fours:49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, we'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. The last one is 488, which is 488/10=48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So units:49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89,180-189,...,480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Let's see: Each hundred has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except possibly the last one. From 1-400: 80-89 (10),180-189 (10),280-289 (10),380-389 (10). That's 4*10=40. Then from 401-488: 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So tens place:40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So hundreds:0. Now, total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188-98=90.

Now, how many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges. So, 5 ranges \u00d7 10 numbers each = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's valid. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. Now, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 188 fours. Now, I need to count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Let's do the same approach, checking each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. To find how many terms, we can use (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would be another range, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's check each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: Here, 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 is included). So, how many eights in the tens place? Each of the first four ranges contributes 10 eights, so 4\u00d710=40. The last range (480-488) contributes 9 eights in the tens place. So total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me double-check: from 80-89: 10 eights. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but wait, our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

Let's see if 480-489 is within 488. 480-489 is pages 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. So, how many blocks? 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), so that's 9 numbers, not 10. So, the first four blocks are full (each has 10 numbers), and the last block has 9. So, total tens place eights: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one block (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 is another block (10 numbers). Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 goes up to 449, which is less than 488, so that's fine. So, how many blocks? Let's count: 40-49 (1), 140-149 (2), 240-249 (3), 340-349 (4), 440-449 (5). So, 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488.

Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The last page is 488, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers add one 8 in the units place. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place, such as 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's check how many such blocks there are. From 1-99: 80-89 is one block (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 is another block (10 numbers). Similarly, 280-289 and 380-389. Now, 480-489 would be another block, but since our book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, how many full blocks? Let's see: 80-89 (1), 180-189 (2), 280-289 (3), 380-389 (4), and 480-488 (5). But wait, the 480-488 block is only 9 numbers because 489 is beyond 488. So, for the tens place, how many eights do we have? Each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 eights, so 4\u00d710=40. The last block, 480-488, contributes 9 eights (since 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers). So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with an 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 40, and the last block contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear, contributing 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 1 to 488, the blocks are 40-49 (1 block), 140-149 (another block), 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, let me check the last block: 440-449. The book goes up to 488, so 449 is within 488, so yes, that's a full block. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but let's check: starting at 8, the last number is 488, which is 8 in the units place. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, how many numbers? The formula is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, first, let's count the full blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. That's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 eights. Then, the last partial block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 more eights in the tens place. So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can only appear in the hundreds place if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we'll count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   - Total occurrences: 49 (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, and we round up to include 484).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.  \n   - Each block has 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.  \n   - Total occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in numbers from 400 to 488.  \n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.  \n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   - Total occurrences: 49 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, and we round up to include 488).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.  \n   - Full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389): 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40.  \n   - Partial block (480-488): 9 occurrences.  \n   - Total occurrences: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
