    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49 have 10 fours in the tens place, 140-149 another 10, and so on. How many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: 40-49: 10 fours, 140-149: 10 fours, 240-249: 10 fours, 340-349: 10 fours, and 440-449: 10 fours. Wait, but 488 is less than 490, so the last block is 440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 400 is the first, 401, 402,..., up to 488. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers. The last number with an 8 in the units place is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10. Now, 480-489 would be another block, but since the book ends at 488, the tens place for 8 in the 400s is only up to 488. So, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place from 480 to 488? That's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, each block before 400 contributes 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each with 10 eights, so 4*10=40, plus the 9 from 480-488, so total 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 484 is the 49th occurrence).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 100: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 fours, totaling 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - Thus, 89 fours.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 488 is the 49th occurrence).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 100: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389.\n   - Each block contributes 10 eights, totaling 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Additionally, from 480-488, there are 9 eights.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Thus, 0 eights.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

Let's count how many such decades there are. From 40-49: 10 fours. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So that's 5 decades, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in the numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (including both 400 and 488). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units place 49 + tens place 50 + hundreds place 89. Total fours = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, so there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each of the first four decades (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 eights, and the last one (480-488) contributes 9 eights. So, that's 4 x 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding them up: units place 49 + tens place 49 + hundreds place 0. Total eights = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, we subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (4, 14, ..., 484)\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449)\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488)\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (8, 18, ..., 488)\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488)\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = **90**\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Let's count how many such sets there are. Each set contributes 10 fours in the tens place. From 40-49: 10 fours. From 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so it's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but I think I should check if 488 is included. Yes, 488 is included, so from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the units place. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers add another 8. The number of such numbers is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. The first is 8, the last is 488. How many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. Solving for n: 8 + 10(n-1) = 488 => 10(n-1)=480 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 380-389 is okay, but 480-489 would be up to 488, since 489 is beyond. So, let's see: 80-89: 10 eights in the tens place. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: how many? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, each of these contributes 10 eights except the last set, which contributes 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights. Wait, but let me confirm. For 80-89: 10 eights. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484)\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449)\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488)\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488)\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488)\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with an 8 in the tens place. Let's check how many such ranges there are within 488. From 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, so the last range is only 9 numbers because 489 is beyond 488. So, in the hundreds place, for 400-488, the tens place 8 occurs only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four ranges (0-399) each have 10 eights in the tens place, and the last range (400-488) has 9. So, total eights in the tens place: (4 * 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

Let me count how many sets there are. Each set has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. The first set is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go beyond 488? 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So, that's 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. To find the count, I can do (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.

How many numbers are there here? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. Each of these has an 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.

The page numbers go up to 488, so the hundreds digits go up to 4. So, the tens place can be 4 in the 40s, 140s, 240s, 340s, and 440s. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. That would be from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the fours, the 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. How many such numbers are there? Let me calculate: The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. To find how many, I can think of it as (488 - 8)/10 + 1. That's (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit being 8. This occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let me count how many such ranges there are. 80-89: 10 eights in the tens place. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-488: this is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, how many eights do we have? 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all numbers from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit being 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. 8 is not among these, so there are zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484)\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449)\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488)\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488)\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488)\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set would be 440-449. Let's see how many full sets of 100 there are. From 1-488, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500, but 500 is beyond 488). Wait, no, 488 is less than 500, so the hundreds go up to 400, and then 401-488. So, the 4 in the tens place appears in each hundred block. Each hundred block (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-400, that's 4 sets of 10, so 40 fours in the tens place. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours would be 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 400-409 would have tens digit 0, so in 401-488, the tens digit 4 is only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 50 in total. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these 89 numbers, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours printed are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that would be 49 numbers because from 0-488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place, starting at 8, 18, ..., 488. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count these. From 1-488, how many sets of 100 are there? Each 100 block has one set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers), 101-200: 180-189 (10), 201-300: 280-289 (10), 301-400: 380-389 (10). Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens place eights are: 10 (from 80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, same for each hundred, and then 480-488 is 9, so total 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place eights are 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights printed are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the tens place for fours. Let me check again. For fours in the tens place: Each hundred block has 10 fours in the tens place. From 1-400, that's 4 blocks, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours are 40+10=50. That seems correct. Units place fours: from 4,14,...,484. How many? The last number is 484, which is 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. That's correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total eights: 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each hundred block contributes 10 occurrences, and in 401-488, 440-449 adds another 10.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Each hundred block contributes 10 occurrences, and 480-488 adds 9.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**\n\nSo, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Let's see how many complete ranges there are. The first range is 40-49: that's 10 fours. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours. So that's 5*10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 count? Since the book has 488 pages, 440-449 is within 1-488, so yes, it's included. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, the hundreds place is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: starting at 8, each 10 numbers adds another 8 in the units place. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because 488 is the 49th term. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let me see how many complete ranges there are. 80-89: 10 eights in the tens place. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. Now, 480-488: how many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have 4 ranges of 10 eights (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 eights from 480-488. So, total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds places with 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 188. For the 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for the 4's. Let me check that again. The hundreds place for 4's is from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. And for the tens place, 5 ranges of 10, which is 50. Units place: 49. So, 49+50+89=188. For the 8's: units place:49, tens place:49 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488). Wait, 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, that's 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 in tens place, plus 49 in units, total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.

Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48.8, so we take 48 full tens, which would give us 48 eights. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488 is 49 numbers. Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: Does 480-489 exist? Well, 480-489 would be within 400-488, but 488 is the last page. So, 480-488 has 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place (480,481,...,488). Wait, but 480-489 is 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, we only have 9 numbers. So, for the hundreds place in 400-488, the tens place 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place: 4 ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each with 10 eights, plus the 480-488 which has 9 eights. So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me double-check. From 1-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid, but 480-489 isn't needed because 488 is the last page. So, let's see how many sets of ten have 4 in the tens place. Each set contributes 10 fours in the tens place. From 40-49: 10 fours. From 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is fully included in 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488, so all 10 fours are present. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. That would be from 400-488. How many hundreds digits are 4? The hundreds place is 4 for pages 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that happens. The last number is 488, so how many 8's in units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in sets like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. Let me calculate how many full sets there are. 80-89: 10 eights. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: how many eights here? The tens digit is 8, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, in the tens place, 480-488 contributes 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Number of 4's = \u230a484 / 10\u230b + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   - Each range contributes 10 fours, and there are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).  \n   - Number of 4's = 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for page numbers 400-488.  \n   - Number of 4's = 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Number of 8's = \u230a488 / 10\u230b + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   - Each full range (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 eights, totaling 4*10=40.  \n   - The range 480-488 contributes 9 eights (480-488).  \n   - Total number of 8's = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.  \n   - Number of 8's = 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference between the number of 4's and 8's:**  \n188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = **90**.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

Let me count how many such blocks there are. Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. How many blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 fours). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 fours). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 fours). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 fours). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 fours). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10 fours. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, 440-449 is correct because 449 is less than 488, so yes, that's 10 fours. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers. For example, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is included, so let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? Let's calculate: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is the last page, that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, let me count the blocks: From 0-99: 80-89 (10 eights). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 eights). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 eights). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 eights). From 400-488: 480-488 (9 eights). So, how many eights in the tens place? Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, so 4*10=40, plus 9 from the last block, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 800 onwards, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no hundreds places with 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Wait, that seems a bit off because when I was counting fours, I had 188 fours, and eights are 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But wait, let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems. Let me go through the fours again. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? Let me calculate (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. That's correct. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. So, fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. How many? (488-8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, totaling 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, eights: 49+49=98. Therefore, the difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, and so on. How many blocks are there? The hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. Wait, but page numbers start at 1, so the hundreds digit can be 0 (for numbers 1-99), 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, for the tens place, the 4 can be in the tens place for each hundred. So, from 0-99: 40-49 (10 fours). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 fours). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 fours). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 fours). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 fours).

Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is included, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of this. So, how many blocks are there? From 0-99: 80-89 (10 eights). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 eights). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 eights). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 eights). From 400-488: 480-488 (9 eights, since 488 is the last page). So, the first four blocks have 10 eights each, and the last block has 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800 onwards, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place. A 4 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 fours in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full blocks (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but the last block is only up to 488, so the tens place in 400-488 will have 40-49 as the tens part, but only up to 488. Let me think: Each block from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Each of the first three blocks contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so that's 3*10=30. Now, the last block, 400-488, the tens place goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the limit). So, in the 400-488 range, the tens place is 40-49 only when the tens digit is 4, which is 440-449. That's another 10 fours. So total tens place fours are 30 + 10 = 40. Wait, but 400-488 includes 400-499, but since the book only goes up to 488, the 440-449 is included, but 450-488 doesn't have a 4 in the tens place. So yes, that's correct, 10 fours in the tens place for the 400-488 block. So total tens place fours are 40. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. A 4 in the hundreds place occurs in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have a 4 in the hundreds place? That's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me confirm: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so yes, 89 fours. So total fours: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 40 + 89 = 178 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the units digit. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's see: from 1-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189 is another 10. 200-299: 280-289 is another 10. 300-399: 380-389 is another 10. 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the tens place, how many eights? For the first three blocks (1-399), each contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 3*10=30. The last block (400-488) contributes 9 eights in the tens place (480-488). So total tens place eights are 30 + 9 = 39. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So total eights: units (49) + tens (39) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 39 = 88 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 178 - 88 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 178, and the number of 8's is 88.

Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's one range. Then, 140-149: another, and so on up to 440-449. So, that's 5 ranges in total (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). Each range contributes 10 fours, so 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 eights in the tens place. How many such ranges are there? Let's see: 80-89 is one, 180-189 is another, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be another, but since the book only goes up to 488, the range 480-489 is only up to 488. So, how many full ranges are there? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 full ranges (each contributing 10 eights) and one partial range (480-488) contributing 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the book.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 4 full ranges \u00d7 10 + 1 partial range (9) = 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Each of these blocks contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 1-99: 40-49 (10 fours). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 fours). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 fours). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 fours). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 fours). Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10 fours. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one. So, 8, 18, ..., 488. That's 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many such blocks contribute to the tens place. From 1-99: 80-89 (10 eights). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 eights). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 eights). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 eights). From 400-488: 480-488. How many eights are here? From 480-488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, the tens place contributes 9 eights here. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (from 80-89, etc.) plus 9 in 480-488. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 100: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 fours, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Number of occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears from 400 to 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89 (488 - 400 + 1).\n\n**Total number of 4's:**\n- 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 100: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 eights each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 eights.\n   - Number of occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book only goes up to 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**\n- 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

Each block of 100 has 10 fours in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be another block, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. So, how many eights in the tens place? Let's see: 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 eights (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them). Wait, no, actually, the tens digit is 8 for all numbers from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all 9. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, so 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but earlier I thought each block contributes 10, but the last block only contributes 9. So, 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each with 10 eights, and the partial block 480-488 with 9 eights. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

Then each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, etc.) has another 10 fours in the tens place. So, 10 fours per hundred. How many hundreds do we have? The book goes up to 488, so the hundreds are 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, that's four sets. But wait, the last set is only up to 488, so in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, right? Because 450-488 would have tens digits 5-8, so 440-449 is the only set where the tens digit is 4 in the 400s. So, actually, in the 400s, the tens place 4 occurs 10 times (440-449). So, total tens place fours: 10 (from 40-49) + 10 (from 140-149) + 10 (from 240-249) + 10 (from 340-349) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, no. Wait, each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units: 49. Tens place: Each hundred block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. From 40-49: 10. 140-149:10. 240-249:10. 340-349:10. 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, so 5*10=50. So, tens:50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, we'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The first is 8, the last is 488. The step is 10. So, ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units:49. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see: 80-89:10 numbers. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. But wait, the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is included, but 480-488: the tens digit here is 8, but only from 480-488. So, in the 400s, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, tens place: 10 (from 80-89) +10 (180-189)+10(280-289)+10(380-389)+9(480-488)= 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place:49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as the book doesn't reach 800.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Each of these ranges has 10 fours in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-488, the ranges are: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but I need to check if 440-449 is fully within 488. Since 449 is less than 488, yes, it's included. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because it's the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 8. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be the next, but since the book ends at 488, we only go up to 488. So, let's see: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. The last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place, we have four full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 eights, and then 480-488 contributing 9 eights. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.

Now, how many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, that's 10 fours. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10 fours. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 10 fours. 300-399: 340-349, 10 fours. 400-488: 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10 fours. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check the last range: 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but actually, in the hundreds place, it's only the first digit, so each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484. The number of fours is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. That's correct. Tens place: 40-49: 10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So total fours: 49 +50 +89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 -8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89:10 eights. From 100-199:180-189:10 eights. From 200-299:280-289:10 eights. From 300-399:380-389:10 eights. From 400-488:480-488: here, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, the 8's in 480-488 are 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, total in tens place: 4 ranges with 10 eights each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) =4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** The 4 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 fours in the tens place. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges. So, 5 ranges \u00d7 10 fours each = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but the last range is 440-449, and the book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 488, so it's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them all up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 = 99, and 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 ends with 88, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. Let me count how many. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms can be calculated as (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let me check each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, 10 eights. - 180-189: another 10 eights. - 280-289: another 10 eights. - 380-389: another 10 eights. - 480-488: here, the tens digit is 8 from 480 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 eights in the tens place for this range. So, total eights in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me recount: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10\u00d74 +9=40+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yep, that seems right.

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place can have 4 in the form of 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but our book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid, but 480-489 would also have 4 in the tens place, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 includes 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but let me think again. The tens place is the second digit from the right. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). So, from 1 to 488, how many hundreds do we have? Well, 488 is in the 400s. So, we have the 100s, 200s, 300s, and 400s. Each of these contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40. But wait, the 400s go up to 488, so does the tens digit go up to 8? Wait, no, the tens digit in the 400s can be 0-8 because 488 is the last page. So, the tens digit in the 400s would be 0-8, meaning that the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, actually, the 400s contribute 10 fours in the tens place as well. So, total tens place fours are 4*10=40. Wait, but let me confirm. From 1-99: tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Wait, no, because 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers because it stops at 488. Wait, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, so that's separate. So, the tens digit 4 in the 400s is only 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 4 sets (100s, 200s, 300s, 400s), each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Wait, but from 1-99, that's the first set, so that's 5 sets? Wait, no, 1-99 is the first hundred, then 100-199 is the second, 200-299 third, 300-399 fourth, and 400-488 is the fifth, but in the fifth, the tens digit 4 only occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, same as the others. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. So, total tens place fours: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. That occurs from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, let me check that again. Units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours:188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. To find how many, divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let's check each hundred. From 1-99: 80-89, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers because it stops at 488. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (from 1-399) and 1 set of 9 (from 400-488). So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, tens place contributes 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Therefore, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my counts. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

Each block has 10 fours in the tens place. Let's see how many complete blocks there are. From 1 to 488, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449? Since 488 is higher than 449, that block is complete. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. So, pages 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours. Now, let's add up the fours from each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place. The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count the blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each with 10 eights, so 4*10=40 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place. The 8 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 800 onwards, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (40) = 89. So, total eights are 89. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 89 eights = 99.

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 440-488, so that's valid. So, how many ranges is that?

Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, let me check that addition again: 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, I need to count the number of 8's. Let's do the same approach, checking each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. This occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many such ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. That's 5 ranges. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, etc.) has 10 eights in the tens place, but the last one, 480-488, has only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 480 to 488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9. So, for the first four ranges, each contributes 10 eights, and the last one contributes 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: \\( \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - There are 5 such ranges (including 40-49).\n   - Each range contributes 10 fours.\n   - Total: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: \\( \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - First four ranges contribute 10 eights each, and the last range (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:** \\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (400-488 inclusive). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. The last number with an 8 in the units place before 488 is 488 itself. So, starting from 8, every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. To find the count, I can divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, 48, but let me check: 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8*1=8, 8*2=16? Wait, no, that's not the right way. Wait, each 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8, and then 8 in the 49th group, which is 488. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is within 488, so let's check each range. - 80-89: 10 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: Here, the tens digit is 8, but the numbers go from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me check again: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99; 99+89=188. Correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. Correct. 188-98=90. Yes, that seems right.

Let's see how many complete blocks of 100 we have. The book has 488 pages, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each of the first four hundreds, the tens place has 10 fours. So that's 4 * 10 = 40 fours. Now, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), how many fours are there in the tens place? The tens digit is 4 from 440-449. That's 10 numbers. So, 10 fours in the tens place here. So, total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place is 4 for the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488.

So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place.

Let me figure out how many such blocks there are up to 488. The first block is 40-49 (10 fours), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 488 have a 4 in the tens place? 488 is 4 in the hundreds, 8 in the tens, and 8 in the units. So, the last block is 440-449, which is before 488.

Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, I'll do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers. So, starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences.

So, the first four blocks give 4 * 10 = 40 eights, and the last partial block gives 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Similarly, in 140-149, another 10, and so on. Let's see how many such blocks there are up to 488. The blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. Each block contributes 10 fours. So, that's 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Each full block (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's see how many full blocks there are. From 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10. That's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 eights. Now, the last block is 480-488, which is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, in the tens place, how many eights? Each number from 480-488 has an 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. This totals 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Let's count how many such sets there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one set, so 10 fours. From 100-199: 140-149 is another set, another 10 fours. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449 each contribute 10 fours. Now, how many such sets are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first set, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go beyond 488? Let me check: 449 is less than 488, so yes, that set is valid. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. Let's subtract 400 from 488 and add 1: 488 - 400 = 88, so 88 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me check the last occurrence. 488 is the last page, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 8, 18, ..., 488. Let me count: the first is 8 (1st), then every 10 numbers. So, from 8 to 488, that's (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, for 10 consecutive numbers each time. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, let's count the sets: - 80-89: 10 eights. - 180-189: 10 eights. - 280-289: 10 eights. - 380-389: 10 eights. - 480-488: 9 eights. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks. Each block gives 10 fours, so 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block gives 10 eights in the tens place. From 1-488, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks. So, 4 * 10 = 40 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, there are 89 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 89 eights = 99. So, there are 99 more fours than eights. Wait, let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. Total 188. For eights: units: 49, tens: 40, hundreds: 0. Total 89. 188 - 89 = 99.

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Now, since the book has 488 pages, let's see how many full blocks of 100 there are. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. For each of the first four hundreds, the tens place has 10 fours. So, 4 * 10 = 40 fours. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens place from 401-409 has 9 fours (401-409 is 9 numbers, but wait, 401-409 is actually 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 0 in 401, so wait, no, 401-409: 401 has 0 in tens, 402 has 0, ..., 409 has 0. So, actually, the tens digit is 0 here. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 401 is 4-0-1, so the tens digit is 0. Then, when does the tens digit become 4 in the 400s? It's from 440-449, right? So, in the 400s, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, in the 400s, we have 10 fours in the tens place. So, total tens place fours: 4 (from the first four hundreds) * 10 = 40, plus 10 from 440-449, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but wait, the book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's valid. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. Each number in this range has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The last page is 488, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, starting from 8, every 10 numbers up to 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each full block of 100 contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's see how many full blocks there are. Up to 400, we have 4 full hundreds, but the last block is 400-488, which is partial. So, for the first four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. In each, the tens place has 10 eights (e.g., 80-89 in each). So, 4 * 10 = 40 eights. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Each of these has an 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. Therefore, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights in total.

Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 40-49: that's one block. Then, 140-149: another block. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 fours, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 5 blocks. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But we're only concerned with the hundreds digit, which is 4. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 ends with an 8, so that's included. Let me see how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but since 488 is the 49th occurrence, we have 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count the blocks. From 80-89: that's one block. Then, 180-189: another, 280-289: another, 380-389: another. So, 4 blocks. Each block has 10 eights, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights in the tens place. Wait, but does 480-489 have an 8 in the tens place? Yes, 480-489 would be another block, but since the book only goes up to 488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. So, that's 9 numbers (480-488), but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's an additional 9 eights in the tens place. Wait, but I thought the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, 480-489 would be another block, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488. So, that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

Let's see how many complete blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one block. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours in total. Wait, let me check that again. Units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 occurrences. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let me count how many complete blocks there are. From 0-99: 80-89 is one block, contributing 10 eights. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the last block only has 9 eights instead of 10. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only has 488 pages, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights in total. Wait, let me double-check: units 49, tens 49, so 98. That seems correct. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-99: 40-49 (10 fours). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 fours). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 fours). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 fours). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 fours). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10 fours. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but I should check if the upper limit is beyond 488. The last block is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. So, every page from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such blocks are within 488. From 1-99: 80-89 (10 eights). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 eights). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 eights). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 eights). From 400-488: 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 480-488. So, how many eights in the tens place here? From 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, so that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the hundreds place, the block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers instead of 10. So, the tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) giving 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but wait, 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, so in the tens place, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 49, tens place:50, hundreds place:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds place:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

Each of these blocks contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the blocks are: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many? If I divide 488 by 10, I get 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, 8, 18, ..., 488: that's 49 times. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except maybe the last one. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, the first four blocks give 4 * 10 = 40 eights, and the last block gives 9 eights. So, total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one block. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So that's a total of 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 fours, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in units? The first 4 is at 4, and the last is at 484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So units: 49. Tens place: As above, 5 blocks, each 10 numbers, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89. So 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first is 8, the last is 488. How many? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. From 1-99: 80-89 is one block (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. From 400-488: The next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, only 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, how many 8's? From 1-99: 10 eights. From 100-199: 10. From 200-299: 10. From 300-399: 10. From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So total eights in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, let me check the tens place again. From 400-488, the tens place 8's would be in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, as I thought. So yes, 49 eights in the tens place. So total eights: 49+49=98. So, number of fours is 188, number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 blocks give 4*10=40 fours. Now, the last partial block is 401-488. In the tens place, 40-49 would have been in the 400s, but since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit in 401-488 is 4 only in 401-410, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, and 450-488. Wait, that might not be accurate. Let me think again. The tens digit is 4 in the range 400-409, 410-419, etc. But wait, no, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 440-449, etc. Wait, actually, in the 400s, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me correct this. In the 400s, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But since our upper limit is 488, 440-449 is entirely within 401-488. So, that's another 10 fours in the tens place. Therefore, in the 400s, we have 10 fours in the tens place. So, adding that to the previous 40, we get 40+10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me check again. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 hundreds would have 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours are 40+10=50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count them. Each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. From 1-400, we have 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. Therefore, total eights in the tens place are 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. This is 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. This is 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This is 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any page number up to 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 1-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 fours. From 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 fours. From 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 fours. From 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 fours. From 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, each number from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but let me check: 400 is included, so 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours are 188.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see: The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, but 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, it's included. So, units place has 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 eights. Let's see how many blocks there are. From 1-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 eights. From 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 eights. From 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 eights. From 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 eights. From 400-488: 480-489, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens place 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place here. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (from 1-399) plus 9 in 400-488. So, 4*10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no hundreds place eights. So, hundreds place eights = 0.\n\nAdding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place in the 400-488 range. The numbers where the tens digit is 8 are 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. That's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 eights in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 from 1-399, plus 9=49. That's correct.\n\nNow, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place for 4's, I had 89 fours because from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. But let me confirm: 488 - 400 +1 = 89. Yes, that's correct.\n\nFor the 8's, the hundreds place is 0, correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 49, correct.\n\nTens place for 4's: 5 blocks, each 10, so 50, correct.\n\nUnits place for 8's: 49, correct.\n\nTens place for 8's: 49, correct.\n\nSo, 4's: 49 +50 +89=188.\n\n8's: 49 +49 +0=98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nHmm, but wait, I'm a bit confused because when I did the tens place for 8's, I thought it was 49, but let me make sure.\n\nWait, the tens place for 8's is:\n\n- 80-89: 10 eights\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nSo, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place:\n\n- 40-49:10\n- 140-149:10\n- 240-249:10\n- 340-349:10\n- 440-449:10\n\nThat's 5 blocks, each 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I just thought, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 is included in the units place count for 8's, so that's correct.\n\nWait, another thing: when counting the hundreds place for 4's, does 400-488 include 89 numbers? Let me check: 400 is the first, 488 is the last. So, 488 -400 =88, plus 1 is 89. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Count the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 fours, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Count the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This totals 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place within 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's minus number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** The 4 appears in the tens place for every block of 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, there are 10 fours in the tens place. Similarly, from 140-149, another 10, and so on. Let's see how many such blocks there are in 488 pages. The blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, five blocks. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place for page numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, it does. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. Let me calculate how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers with 8 in the units place? Let's see: The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms can be found by (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the last block. Each full block (like 80-89) has 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count how many full blocks there are. 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 eights (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, no: 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, the total number of eights is units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when counting the tens place for eights, I considered 480-488 as 9 eights, but actually, from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place, so that's correct. So, yes, 49 in units, 49 in tens, total 98 eights. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   Number of 4's = 49 (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4 \u2192 49 numbers).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   There are 5 such blocks, each contributing 10 fours.  \n   Number of 4's = 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in page numbers 400-488.  \n   Number of 4's = 89 (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   Number of 8's = 49 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 49 numbers).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   There are 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 10 eights each, and the partial block 480-488 contributes 9 eights.  \n   Number of 8's = (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   No page numbers in 800-899, so no 8's here.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 fours. From 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 include 440? Yes, because 440 is within 488. So, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours.

The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does it count as the 49th?

So, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place.
