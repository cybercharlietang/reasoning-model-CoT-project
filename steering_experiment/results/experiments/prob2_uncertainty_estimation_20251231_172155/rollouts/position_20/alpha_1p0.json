    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). Since the book goes up to 488, we have four full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, actually, the first block is 1-100, so the tens place 4 appears in 40-49 (10 times), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and then 440-449 (another 10). But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers are there from 400-488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place contributes 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences (e.g., 80-89). How many full hundreds do we have? Up to 488, so we have four full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. So, the tens place 8 appears in 80-89 (10 times), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). Now, does 480-489 have an 8 in the tens place? 480-489 would be the next block, but since the book ends at 488, we have 480-488. So, in the tens place, 480-488 has 9 numbers (480-488), but since we're only considering the tens digit, 480-488 all have 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 more occurrences. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, etc.) plus 9 in 480-488. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, tens place contributes 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 540-549 isn't because 540 is beyond 488. Let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each set of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-400, how many such sets are there? 4 sets: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, that's 5 sets. Each set contributes 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. So, all numbers from 400 to 488 have a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, hundreds place has 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's printed: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. Let me check: 8,18,...,488. Yes, from 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, 480-488 is included. So, how many sets? Each set is 10 numbers. From 1-488, the sets are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, the first four sets are full (80-89, etc.), each contributing 10 numbers, and the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 800, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed: 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Wait, but wait a second. The first page is 1, so the first occurrence is 4, which is the 4th page. So, from 4 to 484, inclusive, how many numbers? The formula is ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So yes, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49, which is within 1-99. Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 100-488, right? So, how many blocks? From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, it's valid. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. Wait, but let me check: 400 to 488 inclusive is 89 numbers because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. Using the same formula: ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 80-89 (within 1-99), 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Now, does 480-489 fall within 488? 480-489 is 10 numbers, but since the book only goes up to 488, the tens digit 8 in the hundreds place would be 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but wait, in the tens place, 8 can appear in 480-489, but since our book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 in the hundreds place would be 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but I'm considering the tens place. So, in the tens place, 8 can appear in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, not 10, because 489 is beyond 488. So, for the tens place, the blocks are: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 full blocks and one partial block. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. Wait, but wait, in the tens place, the 8 can only be in the tens digit, so for 480-488, the tens digit is 8 (since 480 is 4 8 0, 481 is 4 8 1, etc., up to 488). So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one block of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 4 blocks \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think of it as for each complete set of 10 numbers, there's one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place, which is 48. But wait, the last set is 481-490, but our book stops at 488, so in the units place, the 4's go up to 484, which is within 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, 484 is included, and 494 would be beyond 488. Wait, no, 494 is beyond 488, so the last 4 in the units place is 484. So, how many 4's in the units place? Let me think differently: For each ten's place, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in the units place, every 10 numbers, there's one 4. So, total number of 4's in units place is total pages divided by 10, rounded down, but considering that 488 is not a multiple of 10. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, which is 48, and then in the last partial ten (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 484 is included. So, that's one more 4 in the units place, making it 49. So, units place: 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). So, that's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have a 4 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49+50=99, plus 89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, which is 48. Then, in the last partial ten (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included. So, that's one more 8 in the units place, making it 49. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8's in the tens place occur in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. So, let's count how many full ranges we have. From 0-99: 80-89, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488. Now, how many numbers are in 480-488? That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, the number of 8's is 4 full ranges (each contributing 10) plus 9 in the last partial range. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place: 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me think again about the tens place for 4's. When counting the tens place for 4's, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's five ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. That seems correct. For 8's in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five ranges, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, 4 full ranges with 10 each, and one with 9, totaling 49. So, that seems correct. Units place: 49 for both 4's and 8's. So, 4's: 49+50+89=188. 8's:49+49+0=98. Difference:90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** Every 10 numbers contribute one 4.

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place, the 4 can appear in the tens digit, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Let's count them: - 40-49: 10 numbers - 140-149: 10 numbers - 240-249: 10 numbers - 340-349: 10 numbers - 440-449: 10 numbers So that's 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 numbers. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding them all up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. How many? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488. So, 49 occurrences. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place. Let me calculate: - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189: 10 numbers - 280-289: 10 numbers - 380-389: 10 numbers - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. That's 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Adding up the units and tens place: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4 to 484. This gives 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400 to 488, giving 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8 to 488. This gives 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is entirely within 400-488, so yes, 10 numbers. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49+50=99, then 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 is the last page. So, the first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that range. Let me check each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98=90. Wait, that can't be right because 188-98 is 90, but let me double-check my counts because 90 seems a bit high. Let me go through each digit place again for both 4's and 8's to make sure I didn't make a mistake. **Counting 4's again:**\n- Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n- Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each range is 10 numbers, 5 ranges, so 50. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. Correct.\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\n**Counting 8's again:**\n- Units place: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. Number of terms: ((488-8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n- Tens place: 80-89 (10),180-189 (10),280-289 (10),380-389 (10),480-488 (9). Total 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 0. Correct.\nTotal 8's:49+49=98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. Is there a chance I miscounted the hundreds place for 4's? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. 488-400=88, so +1 is 89. Correct. And for 8's, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, which I included correctly. So, yes, 90 seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Let's see how many such blocks there are. The book goes up to 488, so we have the 100s, 200s, 300s, and 400s. In the 400s, the tens digit goes up to 8, so the 40-49 in the 400s is 440-449. How many blocks? 4 blocks (100s, 200s, 300s, 400s). Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. But wait, in the 400s, the tens digit goes up to 8, so 440-449 is valid, but 450-488 don't have a 4 in the tens place. So, yes, 40 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. That's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. So, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 49+40=89, 89+89=178. So, total 178 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The first is 8, the last is 488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so in the 400s, it's 480-488. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many blocks? Again, 100s, 200s, 300s, 400s. Each contributes 10, so 4*10=40. But in the 400s, the tens digit goes up to 8, so 480-488 is valid, which is 9 numbers, not 10. Wait, so in the 400s, the tens digit 8 is from 480 to 489, but the book ends at 488, so only 9 numbers: 480-488. So, for the 400s, it's 9 instead of 10. So, total tens place 8's: 3 blocks (100s, 200s, 300s) each with 10, so 3*10=30, plus 9 in the 400s, total 39. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (39) + hundreds (0) = 49+39=88. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 178 (4's) - 88 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (from 4 to 484, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Total blocks (100s, 200s, 300s, 400s): 4 blocks.\n   - Total occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89 (from 400 to 488 inclusive).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **178**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (from 8 to 488, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block which has 9 (480-488).\n   - Total blocks (100s, 200s, 300s, 400s): 4 blocks.\n   - Total occurrences: 3 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 39.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 39 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **88**.\n\n**Difference:**\n178 (number of 4's) - 88 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times this happens. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers. Let's see how many such blocks are there. From 1-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: The next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, only 480-488 has 8's in the tens place. So, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but 480-489 is 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (from 1-399) plus 9 in 400-488. So, 4*10 +9=40+9=49. Wait, but let me double-check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

Each block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: from 1-99, the block is 40-49 (10 numbers). Then, 100-199: 140-149 (10), 200-299: 240-249 (10), 300-399: 340-349 (10), and 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers.

So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. So, every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's.

Each block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 1-99: 80-89 (10). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: Does 480-489 exist? Since the book ends at 488, 480-488 would be the range, but only up to 488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 is the last page. So, in the hundreds place for 400-488, the tens digit 8 only appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, how does this affect the count? Let's see: from 1-399, we have 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. So, tens place contributes 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800 or above. But since the book has only 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 40, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit within 1-488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Each of these blocks has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in 1-99, there's one block (40-49). In 100-199, another block (140-149). Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 300-399: 340-349, and 400-488: 440-449. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 = 99, then 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so it's included. So, from 8, 18, ..., 488: that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. How many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in 1-99: 80-89 (1 block), 100-199: 180-189 (1 block), 200-299: 280-289 (1 block), 300-399: 380-389 (1 block). Now, 400-488: the next block would be 480-489, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers. Wait, but 480-489 is 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, but that's only 9 numbers, not 10. So, how does this affect the count? Let's see: from 0-399, we have 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 numbers, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 40 + 9 = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book is 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are there than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, and hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit '4':**\n1. **Units place:** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49, which is in the 40s, then 140s, 240s, 340s, and 440s. That's 5 blocks. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. However, wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 440-449, which is fine because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. That's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let's check: 8, 18, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because 488 is included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Each block has 10 numbers, except the last one which has 9 numbers (480-488). Let's count the number of blocks. The first block is 80-89, then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks. The first four blocks each contribute 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.

Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, let's see how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one block. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks in total. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences.

Yes, but since the book only goes up to 488, the 480-488 range is included. So, let's count these blocks. From 0-99: 80-89 is one block (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 is another (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488 is another block, but how many numbers? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. Wait, but in the tens place, 8 is only in the tens digit, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, the tens place has 4 blocks of 10 and one partial block of 9. So, 4 * 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

Now, how many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.

Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. Let's calculate how many. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.

So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but since the book only has 488 pages, there are no numbers in the hundreds place with 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

    "text": " Let me confirm: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 49. Because 488 is the last page, and 484 is the last page with a 4 in the units place. So, 484 is the 49th occurrence. Hmm, maybe I should think differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place can be calculated by taking the total number of pages divided by 10, and then taking the floor of that. But since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, floor is 48, but since 484 is within the range, we have 49 occurrences. Wait, maybe that's not the right way. Let me think again. For units place, the 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But then, in the incomplete group (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, 484 is in this incomplete group, so that's an extra 4. So total 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, so units place: 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, so that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another range, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many ranges? From 0-99: 1 range. 100-199: 1 range. 200-299: 1 range. 300-399: 1 range. 400-488: 1 range (440-449). So that's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is only 10 numbers, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5*10=50. So, tens place: 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8. But in the incomplete group (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included. So, 48 full groups (1-480) give 48 eights, and then 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 eights. Wait, but let me check: 488 is included, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. How many ranges? From 0-99: 80-89 is one range, 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189, another 10. 200-299: 280-289, another 10. 300-399: 380-389, another 10. 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, first four ranges contribute 4*10=40, and the last range contributes 9. So, total tens place eights: 40+9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place: 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Therefore, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. The difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full ranges contributing 40 occurrences and the partial range 480-488 contributing 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Let's see how many sets of ten there are where the tens digit is 4. From 0-99: 40-49 is one set, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 488. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 here. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms can be calculated as ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-488. Let's count how many sets: From 0-99: 80-89 is one set, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.

Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the blocks are 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. In each of the first four blocks (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit is 4 in the range 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, that's 10 numbers per block, and there are 4 blocks, so 4*10=40. Now, in the last block, 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, adding that, 40+10=50. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Adding all these up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks we have. From 1-488, the blocks are 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. In each of the first four blocks, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, 10 numbers per block, 4 blocks, so 4*10=40. Now, in the last block, 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, adding that, 40+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's.

    "text": " Wait, let me confirm: 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, but since we include both the start and end, it's actually 48 + 1 = 49. Yeah, that seems right.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. Starting from 40-49 (that's 10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488? Yes, so all these ranges are valid. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This happens from page 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Wait, but in these numbers, the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, right? So, that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but hold on, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, but each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 more 4's. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, it does. So, how many such numbers? Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The first is 8, the last is 488. To find how many terms, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last range. So, how many ranges? 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers, since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 ranges with 10 numbers each and 1 range with 9 numbers. So, total in tens place is 4*10 +9 = 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, yes, 49 in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8. I had 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 is correct.\n\nAnd for the 8's, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check again: 4's in units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct.\n\n8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the units place for 4's. Let me check again. The units place for 4's goes from 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The last term is 484, which is 4 + 10*(n-1)=484. So, 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 terms. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place, 8,18,...,488. Last term is 488. So, 8 +10*(n-1)=488. 10*(n-1)=480, n-1=48, n=49. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, 49 each for units place in both 4 and 8.\n\nWait, but for 8's in the tens place, I had 49, and 4's in the tens place I had 50. So, that's where the difference comes in. Let me see: 4's in tens place: 40-49 (10),140-149(10),240-249(10),340-349(10),440-449(10). That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Correct.\n\nFor 8's in tens place: 80-89(10),180-189(10),280-289(10),380-389(10),480-488(9). So, 4 full ranges and one partial, totaling 49. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For example, in the hundreds place, 4's are from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, correct. And 8's don't appear in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so the hundreds digit is 4, right? So, 488 is included in the hundreds place count for 4's.\n\nYes, so that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference between their counts.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers (from 4 to 484, inclusive).\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges, totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\n   **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last range (480-488) contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n   **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 90 times more than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

How many complete sets of 10 are there in 488? That's 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. So, 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4, so 48 fours. But wait, the 48th set ends at 480, so the next set is 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, we have 8 more numbers: 481-488. In this partial set, does the units digit have a 4? Yes, 484. So, that's one more 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 fours in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. The first range is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. How many ranges are there? From 0 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds. But wait, the first hundred is 1-100, but the tens digit starts from 00-09, 10-19, etc. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly one decade (e.g., 40-49). So, in 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? Well, the hundreds are 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, that's 5 hundreds, but the last one is only up to 488. So, in each of the first four hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), there's one full decade where the tens digit is 4, contributing 10 fours each. So, 4 ranges \u00d7 10 = 40 fours. Now, in the last hundred, 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, and then 450-488, but the tens digit doesn't go back to 4 in that range. Wait, no, 440-449 is the only set where the tens digit is 4 in that last partial hundred. So, that's another 10 fours. So, total tens place 4's would be 4\u00d710 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 fours. So, total tens place 4's: 5 ranges (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) but the last one only contributes 10 fours, so total is 4\u00d710 + 10 = 50. Hmm, that seems correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right because 488 is only 488 numbers, and 188 fours seems high. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me check again. The hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Then, units place was 49, tens place 50. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since we only go up to 488, the last range is 480-488. So, how many such ranges are there? The first four hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each have one full decade where the tens digit is 8, contributing 10 eights each. So, 4 ranges \u00d7 10 = 40 eights. Now, the last hundred, 400-488, has 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, that's 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems. Let me verify the units place for fours: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, and then in the last partial set (481-488), there's 484, which is another 4. So, 48 + 1 = 49 fours in the units place. That seems correct. For the tens place, fours: in each hundred, there's 10 fours in the tens place. From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each has 10 fours in the tens place, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. That seems correct. Hundreds place: 89 fours from 400-488. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. For eights: units place is 49, as calculated. Tens place: 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each have 10 eights in the tens place, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Hundreds place: none, so total eights: 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n3. **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n3. **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences (since page numbers don't reach 800).\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think differently. Let me consider the total number of units digits. For each ten numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488? That's 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. So, there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, the last set is from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the units place, does 484 count as the 49th occurrence? Yes, because 484 is within the 480-489 range, so that's the 49th. So, units place has 49 fours. Hmm, maybe I should calculate it as (488 + 1) // 10, which is (489) // 10 = 48.9, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is the last page, the 480-488 range includes 484, so that's an extra 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, so units place: 49 fours.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So, that's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 fours, so 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, tens place: 50 fours.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 89 fours.\n\nNow, total number of fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188 fours.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Okay, that seems right.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nAgain, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many times? Let's see. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place: 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, does 480-488 count? Yes, because the tens digit is 8. So, how many ranges? Let's see:\n\n- 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers)\n- 100-199: 180-189 (10)\n- 200-299: 280-289 (10)\n- 300-399: 380-389 (10)\n- 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488)\n\nWait, but in the tens place, each of the first four ranges contributes 10 eights, and the last range contributes 9 eights. So total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=40+9=49.\n\nWait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but in the tens place, each of these has 8 in the tens digit. So, 9 eights in the tens place from 480-488.\n\nSo, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place: 0 eights.\n\nNow, total number of eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. For each hundred, 80-89 is 10 numbers, so 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 0-99: 10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, and 400-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nNow, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, for the fours:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor the eights:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90 more fours.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there.\n\nWait, but 400 to 488 inclusive is 488-400+1=89 numbers. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place of fours: 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's five ranges, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 49 fours.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nFor eights:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:49\n\nHundreds:0\n\nTotal:98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems a large difference. Let me check if I counted correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the tens place for fours. Let me recount.\n\nFor tens place fours:\n\n- 40-49:10 numbers\n- 140-149:10\n- 240-249:10\n- 340-349:10\n- 440-449:10\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 ranges, each with 10 fours. So, 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nBut wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is from 440 to 449, which is 10 numbers, right? 440,441,...,449. So, yes, 10 numbers. So, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in the tens place:\n\n- 80-89:10\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nSo, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nSo, total eights:49+49=98.\n\nFours:188.\n\nSo, difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again: in the units place, both 4 and 8 have 49 occurrences. So, the difference comes from the tens and hundreds places.\n\nFours have 50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=139, while eights have 49 (tens). So, the difference is 139-49=90. That's correct.\n\nWait, no, actually, the total fours are 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nEights are 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, let me confirm: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 49? Hmm, maybe. Alternatively, maybe it's 48 because 488 is the last page, so 484 is the last page with a 4 in the units place. So, from 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49 times. Yeah, so 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many times that happens. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers long. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another range. So that's 5 ranges. Each range contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 ranges \u00d7 10 numbers = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 +50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is included. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's see: The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, let's count each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289:10. - 380-389:10. - 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So, total in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 +49 +0 =98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.

This gives 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within the range, but 540-549 would be beyond 488. So, how many sets of 100 are there where the tens digit is 4? From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 numbers. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, we're only considering the hundreds digit, which is 4 for all these numbers. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 occurrences of the digit 4. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me check how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers? Wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. So, how many sets? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. So, tens place contributes 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any page number.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

How many such ranges are there? From 40-49 (first set), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, the last set is 440-449. Does 449 exist? Since the book has 488 pages, 449 is within the range. So, yes, 5 sets, so 50 occurrences. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, starting from 8, every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. To find the count, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but we have to include 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is within the page numbers. Since the book goes up to 488, 480-488 is included. So, the ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, but the last one (480-488) has only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, for the first four ranges: 4*10=40. For 480-488: that's 9 numbers. So total in tens place: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the difference is number of 4's minus number of 8's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 4 sets \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences (since 800-899 exceeds 488).\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 50. But wait, from 400-488, the tens place goes up to 488, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488 is 49 numbers (since 488 = 8 + (49-1)*10). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, let's count each range: - 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). - 100-199: 180-189 (10). - 200-299: 280-289 (10). - 300-399: 380-389 (10). - 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers). So, that's 4 ranges with 10 each and 1 range with 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full groups of 10, plus the last number 488. So, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers. Let's count the ranges. From 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-489, but wait, 480-489 is beyond 488, so only up to 488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, for the hundreds place, 400-488, the tens digit 8 would be from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many ranges have 10 numbers? 0-399: 4 ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each with 10 numbers. So, 4\u00d710=40. Then, in 400-488, it's 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, the last block is only up to 488, not 499. So, let's see: 40-49 is one block, 140-149 another, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds place contributes 89 occurrences of 4. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place: 49 occurrences. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 80-89, 100-199: 180-189, 200-299: 280-289, 300-399: 380-389. So, that's 4 blocks. Each contributes 10, so 4 * 10 = 40. But wait, does 480-489 count? Since the book only goes up to 488, the 80-89 block in the hundreds place would be 480-488, right? Wait, no. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4, so the tens digit can be 8 in 480-488. Wait, but I think I might have missed that. Let me clarify. When considering the tens place, the 8 can appear in the tens digit regardless of the hundreds digit. So, in the hundreds digit 4, the tens digit 8 would be from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. So, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. Wait, but earlier, I considered only up to 380-389. So, I think I missed the 480-488 block. So, how many blocks are there? 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks. Now, each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, contributing 10 each. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total in tens place: 4 * 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, tens place contributes 49 occurrences. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800 or above. But since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 occurrences. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.

Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within the range, but 480-489 would be beyond 488. So, let's see: The tens place is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but does 449 exist? Yes, because 488 is the last page, so 449 is included. So, that's 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if these are within 488. 80-89: yes, 180-189: yes, 280-289: yes, 380-389: yes. Now, 480-489: but our book ends at 488, so only 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens place for 8 occurs in 4 ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, so 4\u00d710=40, plus 9 from the last partial range. So, total 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 1 to 488, the blocks are: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check: 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10. So that's 5*10=50. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89= 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 is included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check how many such blocks there are. From 1 to 488, the blocks are: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). Wait, 480-489 would be another block, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, the block 480-489 would have 9 numbers in this case. So, for the tens place, we have four blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10 numbers, and 480-488 contributing 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. Wait, but let me confirm. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total 49+50=99+89=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.  \n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks.  \n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 4 appears in 400-488.  \n   - Total numbers: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.  \n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9.  \n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.  \n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

Now, how many such blocks are there? Since the book goes up to 488, the last block is 440-449. So, that's 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 blocks * 10 = 50. But wait, does the last block go up to 449, which is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 8. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. How many blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks. Now, each block except the last one has 10 numbers, but the last block (480-488) has 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, the first four blocks contribute 10 each, so 4*10=40, and the last block contributes 9. So, total in the tens place is 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above. But since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

Let's see how many such ranges there are. The first range is 40-49 (pages 40 to 49), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges. Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Wait, but the last page is 488, so the range 440-449 is within 488, right? Yes, 449 is less than 488, so all 5 ranges are valid. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).

So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The first is 8, and the last is 488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one. So, 8, 18, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each range has 10 numbers. Let's see how many such ranges there are. 80-89 is page 80-89, 180-189 is 180-189, 280-289 is 280-289, 380-389 is 380-389. Wait, what about 480-489? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. So, does that count as a full range? No, because the tens digit is 8, so 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but since the book stops at 488, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, for the tens place, we have 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Plus, the partial range 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10. That's 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, total 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up units, tens, and hundreds: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " Let me think again: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, starting at 4. So, the count is floor((488 + 1)/10) when considering the units digit. Wait, maybe a better approach is to calculate it as (488 // 10) + 1 if the remainder is >=4. Wait, no, perhaps a more systematic way is better. Let's think: For each digit position, we can calculate the number of times a digit appears by considering higher, current, and lower digits. But maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, for the units place, the number of 4's is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra if the last number in the range has a 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48. Then, we check if the remainder is >=4. Since 8 >=4, we add 1 more, making it 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, counting how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the last set would be 440-449. Let's count how many such sets there are. Each set has 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such sets are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (1 set). From 100-199: 140-149 (another set). From 200-299: 240-249 (another). From 300-399: 340-349 (another). From 400-488: 440-449 (another). So that's 5 sets. Each set has 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's valid. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers, meaning 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the places: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** How many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's calculate how many such numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48. Now, check if the remainder is >=8. Since 8 is exactly the remainder, we add 1 more, making it 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, counting how many times 8 appears in the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count the number of such sets. From 0-99: 80-89 (1 set). From 100-199: 180-189 (another). From 200-299: 280-289 (another). From 300-399: 380-389 (another). From 400-488: 480-488. Now, each of the first four sets contributes 10 numbers, so 4 sets x 10 = 40. The last set, 480-488, is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so that's 9 occurrences. So total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** How many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up all the places: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract 98 from 188: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. How many such blocks are there? The first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), the next is 140-149, then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 count? Since the book goes up to 488, yes, 440-449 is within 488. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, but 488 is included. So, how many numbers? From 8 to 488 with step 10: the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is within 488. Yes, up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place. How many blocks? The first block is 80-89 (10 numbers), then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers, except the last one which is only 9 numbers (from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 numbers, and the last block (480-488) has 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers in the hundreds place with 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as pages go up to 488.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). 100-199: 140-149 (10). 200-299: 240-249 (10). 300-399: 340-349 (10). 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, total blocks are 5, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 8 appears in the units place at 8,18,...,488. So, how many terms? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 80-89 (10). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). Now, 400-488: Does 480-489 fall within 400-488? 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, only 9 numbers here, not 10. So, for the hundreds place 4, the tens digit 8 only goes up to 488, so only 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 in 480-488, so total 49. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so total tens place eights are 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place eights = 0. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. When counting the tens digit 8, from 80-89, that's 10 numbers. Then 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10, and then 480-488: 9 numbers. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, total 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to n can be calculated by (n // 10) + 1 if the units digit is >= 4. Wait, maybe it's better to use a formula. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is equal to (n + 1) // 10. So, for 488, it's (488 + 1) // 10 = 489 // 10 = 48. So, 48 times in the units place. But wait, does that include the 4 in 484? Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. So, 48 times. Hmm, maybe I was wrong earlier. So, units place: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges are there up to 488. The first range is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. That's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the number of 8's in the units place from 1 to 488. Using the formula (488 +1)//10=489//10=48. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four ranges are 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, but let me check: from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4 full ranges of 10 and one partial of 9, total 49. So, tens place: 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 48 + 49 + 0 = 97. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For the 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. For the 8's: units=48, tens=49, hundreds=0. 48+49=97. So, 187-97=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the hundreds place for 4's. Wait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488-400+1=89. So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place. For the tens place of 4's, I had 5 ranges: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 50. That seems correct. For the 8's in the tens place, I had 4 full ranges (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) and one partial (480-488). Each full range is 10, so 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. That seems right. Units place for both digits is 48, which makes sense because every 10 numbers have one occurrence. So, the difference is 187-97=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 48 occurrences (calculated as (488 + 1) // 10).\n2. **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (5 ranges of 10 numbers each).\n3. **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (pages 400 to 488).\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (4 full ranges of 10 and 1 partial range of 9).\n3. **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's = 48 + 49 + 0 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Now, how many such ranges are there? From 40-49: that's one set, then 140-149: another, 240-249: another, 340-349: another, and 440-449: another. That's 5 sets. Each set contributes 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, does the last set go up to 449? Since the book only goes up to 488, 440-449 is within the range. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. To find the count, subtract 399 from 488: 488 - 399 = 89. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 400 is the first number, so the count should be 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. To find how many, divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full decades. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last set. Each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, contributing 4 x 10 = 40. The last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 489 is beyond 488). So, total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds places with 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: units place: 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct. So 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. For 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 488 - 8 = 480, so 480/10 = 48, plus 1 gives 49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, total 49. Correct. So, 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.

Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, starting from 8, every 10 numbers up to 488. Let me calculate how many such numbers there are. The last number is 488, which is 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8 is the first, then 18 is the second, up to 488 being the 49th. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is the last block. So, each block contributes 10 numbers, except the last one, which contributes 9 numbers (480-488). Let me count: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, 480-488: 9. So total is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, tens place contributes 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I feel like maybe I made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check again. The tens place for 8's: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, yes, the difference is 90. Wait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 occurrences. That seems correct. So, yes, 188 fours and 98 eights, difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This totals 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences as the book ends at 488.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** The 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the blocks are 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. In each of the first four blocks (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), there's a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So that's 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, in the last block, 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449. That's another 10 numbers. So, total in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, hundreds place has 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The last one is 488, which is the 8 in the units place. So, starting from 8, each step of 10. The count would be 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, 8, 18, ..., 488. Let me confirm: from 0 to 488, how many multiples of 10 plus 8? The formula is floor((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = floor(480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. In each of the first four blocks, there's a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, etc., so that's 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, in the last block, 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, we have 40 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, yes, 9. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that can't be right because 188 - 98 is 90. But let me double-check my counts because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me recount the fours and eights. For fours: units place: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. Total: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct. For eights: units: 49, tens: 49, hundreds: 0. Total: 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for eights. Let me check again. When counting the tens place for eights, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit is 8 from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's correct. So, 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9 = 49. So, that's correct. Similarly, for fours in the tens place, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 (from 40-49, 140-149, etc.) plus 10 in 440-449, totaling 50. That's correct. So, the difference is indeed 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should approach this by considering each digit place separately and counting the occurrences systematically.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use a formulaic approach for each digit place. For each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nLet's start with the units place:\n\n- For units digit, each digit from 0-9 appears equally in each block of 10 numbers. So, in 488 pages, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 \u00d7 1 = 48 for both 4 and 8. Then, in the incomplete block (481-488), the units digits go from 1-8. So, in this incomplete block, 4 appears once (at 484), and 8 appears once (at 488). So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, tens place:\n\n- Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each block of 100 numbers. So, for 488 pages, how many complete blocks of 100 are there? 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each block contributes 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 for both 4 and 8. Now, the incomplete block is 401-488. In this block, the tens digit goes from 0-8 (since 400-499 would be the next block, but we only go up to 488). So, the tens digits in 401-488 are 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., 8 (481-490, but we only go up to 488). So, for the tens digit 4: it would be in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. For the tens digit 8: it's in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, in the incomplete block, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times. So, total tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8. That's correct.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\n- The hundreds digit is 4 only in the block 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. For 8, the hundreds digit would be 8 in 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place. So, 8's count in hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n- 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 188\n- 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Count the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 50 occurrences (40 in the first four hundreds, 10 in 440-449).\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Count the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 49 occurrences (40 in the first four hundreds, 9 in 480-488).\n   - **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as there are no pages from 800-899.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me confirm: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, the last cycle is 481-490, but our book ends at 488, so in the units place, the last 4 is at 484. So, how many 4's in units place? From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. But wait, in the 480-488 range, the units digit 4 occurs at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, actually, it's 49 times. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that. So, in the units place, the number of 4's is equal to the number of times 4 appears in the units digit from 1 to 488. That would be floor(488/10) + 1 if the last digit is 4. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor(488/10) is 48, and since 488's units digit is 8, which is not 4, so it's 48 times. Wait, but 484 is within 480-489, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, maybe it's 49 times. I'm a bit confused here. Let me think differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place up to N can be calculated as floor((N + 1)/10). So, for N=488, it's floor(489/10)=48. So, 48 times. So, 48 4's in the units place. Okay, moving on. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but our book goes up to 488, so the last set is 440-449. How many such sets are there? From 0-99: 40-49: 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149: 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249: 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349: 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449: 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but in the 400-488 range, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So, 50 times. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how about the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** How many times does 8 appear in the units digit from 1 to 488? Using the same method as before: floor((488 +1)/10)=floor(489/10)=48. So, 48 times. Wait, but let me check: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** How many times does 8 appear in the tens digit? The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is within our range. So, let's count: From 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189:10. From 200-299:280-289:10. From 300-399:380-389:10. From 400-488:480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 times. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** How many times does 8 appear in the hundreds digit? The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times. Now, adding them up: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=48+49=97. So, total 8's:97. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) -97 (number of 8's)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Total occurrences: \u230a488/10\u230b = 48.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n   - Total occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**\n48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Total occurrences: \u230a488/10\u230b = 48.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, except the last range (480-488), which contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**\n48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n**Difference:**\nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 187 - 97 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. So, the tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? Well, 400 to 488 inclusive is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, every number from 400-488 has a 4. So, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which would suggest 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's check each range. From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is 10. From 200-299: 280-289 is 10. From 300-399: 380-389 is 10. From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the hundreds place, 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, adding up: 10 (from 0-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   \nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. The range 480-488 contributes 9 numbers, so total is 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.\n   \nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Let's see how many such blocks exist. The first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block would be 440-449. How many blocks are there? Let's see: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 numbers = 50 occurrences. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? 449 is less than 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many times this happens. 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so we take 48 full sets, which would be 480, but 488 is included. Wait, actually, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, how many numbers? The first is 8, then 18, 28,..., 488. So, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers, like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such blocks exist. The first block is 80-89 (10 numbers), then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. The next would be 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10 eights. The last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total eights in tens place: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 from the last partial block. So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480, 481, ..., 488 is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Number of blocks: 5, each contributing 10 numbers.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Number of full blocks: 4, each contributing 10 numbers.\n   - Partial block: 480-488 contributes 9 numbers.\n   - Total: (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 40-49, that's one range, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's a total of 5 ranges. Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such ranges are there? From 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, 89 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 89 = 99. So, there are 99 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.
