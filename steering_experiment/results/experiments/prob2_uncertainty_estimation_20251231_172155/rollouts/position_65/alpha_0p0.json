So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, but wait, let me think again. Is there any possibility I'm double-counting? For example, numbers like 448 would have both a 4 in the hundreds, tens, and units place. But when I count each digit separately, I'm correctly counting each occurrence, so that's fine. Similarly, 488 has two 8's in the tens and units place, but I've counted each separately. So, I think my counts are correct.

Hmm, so the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly? Another way to check could be to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position again. For 4's: Units: numbers ending with 4. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then 14,24,...,484. The sequence is 4 + 10k where k=0 to 48. So, 49 numbers. Correct. Tens: numbers where the tens digit is 4. That's from 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). So, 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds: numbers from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. For 8's: Units: numbers ending with 8. 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10. So, (488 -8)/10 +1 =480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens: numbers where tens digit is 8. 80-89 (10),180-189 (10),280-289 (10),380-389 (10),480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds: none, as before.

Correct. - Hundreds: none, so 0. Total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. Is 488 included in the units place count? Yes, 488 is counted in the units place for 8. And in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last one. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences (from 4 to 484, stepping by 10).\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   \n   **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences (from 8 to 488, stepping by 10).\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block (480-488), which has 9 occurrences. This gives a total of 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   \n   **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed **90** times more than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be different, but maybe it's correct. Let me think again. Another way to count the 4's: Let's consider each position separately.\n\nUnits place: For every 10 numbers, there's one 4. From 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, so 48. But wait, in the first set (1-10), 4 is included, so actually, it's 49 because 488 is included. So, 49 fours in units place.\n\nTens place: For every 100 numbers, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (40-49, etc.). So, how many hundreds are there? 488 is in the 400-488 range. So, from 0-488, we have 5 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, no, 400-488 is only 89 numbers, not a full hundred. So, in each full hundred (like 0-99), there are 10 numbers with tens digit 4. So, for 0-399, that's 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's:40 +10=50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188. Same as before.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: same as before, 49.\n\nTens place: Let's see, 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: none, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nThus, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in higher places, it's easy to miscount. Let me think if there's another way to approach this, maybe using digit positions and calculating the number of times each digit appears.\n\nAnother approach: For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: As before, 49 times.\n- Tens place: 50 times.\n- Hundreds place:89 times.\nTotal:188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place:49 times.\n- Tens place:49 times.\n- Hundreds place:0 times.\nTotal:98 times.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nI think this is correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** Every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** Every block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 50 such occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** Every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** Every block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), except the last block which has 9 (480-488). Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
