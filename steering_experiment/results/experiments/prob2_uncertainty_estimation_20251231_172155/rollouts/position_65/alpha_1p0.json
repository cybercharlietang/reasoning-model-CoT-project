    "text": " Wait, but in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89. So 49 +50 +89=188. That seems correct.

So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly? Maybe I missed something. Let me think about the hundreds place for 4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct. For 8's, hundreds place is 0. So, yes, 0. So, 188 fours, 98 eights. 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to miscount. Let me try another approach. Let's consider each digit position separately and count the number of 4's and 8's in each. For units place: For 4's: every 10 numbers, so total number is floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 ends with 8, which is less than 4, so 48 full tens, but starting from 4, so 48+1=49. Wait, no, actually, floor(488/10)=48, but since the first 4 is at 4, which is the 4th number in the first ten, so maybe the count is 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, plus one more if the last number is >=4. Wait, maybe it's better to think as (n + 9) // 10, where n is the number. Wait, no, perhaps another way. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is floor((N + 10 - d)/10). So, for d=4, N=488: floor((488 + 6)/10)=floor(494/10)=49.4, so 49. Similarly for d=8: floor((488 + 2)/10)=floor(490/10)=49. So, units place: 49 fours, 49 eights. Now, tens place: The formula is similar but for the tens digit. The number of times d appears in the tens place from 1 to N is floor((N - d*10)/100)*10 + min(max(N - d*10 +1, 0), 10). So, for d=4, N=488: floor((488 -40)/100)=floor(448/100)=4, so 4*10=40. Then, the remainder is 488 -40*10=488-400=88. So, min(88+1,10)=9? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. For the tens digit, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, except possibly the last block. So, from 1-100: 40-49:10 numbers. 101-200:140-149:10. 201-300:240-249:10. 301-400:340-349:10. 401-488:440-449:10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. Similarly, for 8's in the tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, that's correct. Now, hundreds place: For 4's, 400-488:89 numbers. For 8's, none, since 800-899 is beyond 488. So, 0. So, total fours:49 (units)+50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188.

So, yes, 50 in the tens place. Similarly, for 8's, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 9 there. So, yes, 49 in the tens place for 8's. So, 98 total 8's. So, 188-98=90.
