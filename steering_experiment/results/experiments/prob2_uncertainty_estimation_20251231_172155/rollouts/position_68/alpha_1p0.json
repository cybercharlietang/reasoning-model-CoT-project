    "text": " Hmm, seems right. Now, 8's: - Units:49, correct. - Tens: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but wait, in the hundreds place for 8's, there's nothing, so that's 0. So, 98 eights in total. So, the difference is 90. Hmm, but I feel like that's correct, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider each digit position separately and ensure I didn't double-count or miss any. Alternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a more systematic approach. Let me try another way. For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of 4's and 8's. Let's start with the 4's. **Units place (4's):** For each complete group of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing 1 four, so 48. But wait, the last group is 481-490, but our book ends at 488, so in the units place, 488 has an 8, so the last four in the units place is 484. So, that's 48 fours from the complete groups, plus one more for 484, making it 49. Correct. **Tens place (4's):** For each block of 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 ten times. So, in each block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. How many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488? 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial block (401-488), the tens digit is 0-8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? From 440-449, that's 10 numbers, but wait, 488 is the end, so 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 fours. So, total tens place fours:40 +10=50. Correct. **Hundreds place (4's):** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Now, for the 8's. **Units place (8's):** Similar to 4's, each group of 10 has one 8. From 1-488, how many 8's in units place? 488 /10=48.8, so 48 complete groups, each with one 8, so 48. But the last group is 481-490, but we only go up to 488, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, that's 48 +1=49. Correct. **Tens place (8's):** For each block of 100, the tens digit is 8 in 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, etc. How many complete blocks of 100 are there? 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Now, the last partial block is 401-488. In this, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 eights in the tens place here. So, total tens place eights:40 +9=49. **Hundreds place (8's):** As before, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place, since the book ends at 488. So, 0. Total eights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98. So, the difference is 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block which has 9 (480-488).\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I'm overcounting? Wait, let me think. For the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing one 4. That's correct. Now, for the 8's: - Units: 8,18,...,488. How many? Let me list a few: 8,18,28,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 488 =8 +10(n-1). 488-8=480=10(n-1). So, n-1=48, so n=49. Correct. - Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in the hundreds place for fours? Yes, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. For the eights, the hundreds place is zero, so that's correct. So, I think 90 is the right answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Another way to approach this is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position. For a 3-digit number, each position (units, tens, hundreds) can be considered separately. Let's think about each digit position for 4 and 8.\n\nFor the units digit:\n- For 4's: from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? As before, 49.\n- For 8's: similarly, 49.\n\nFor the tens digit:\n- For 4's: each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. So, 4 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) give 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49 in that block, which is 10 numbers (400-409, but wait, 400-409 is 10 numbers, but 400-488 is up to 488. Wait, no, the tens digit being 4 in 400-488 would be 400-409, which is 10 numbers, but 400-488 includes up to 488, so 400-409 is 10 numbers, and 410-419 would be tens digit 1, etc. So, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (400-409). So, total tens digit 4's: 4*10 (from 0-399) +10=50. Correct as before.\n\nFor the eights in the tens place:\n- Similarly, each block of 100 has 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) give 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, total eights in tens place:40+9=49. Correct as before.\n\nFor the hundreds digit:\n- Fours: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours.\n- Eights: no numbers in 800-899, so 0.\n\nSo, adding up, fours:49(units)+50(tens)+89(hundreds)=188\nEights:49(units)+49(tens)+0(hundreds)=98\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to 8's. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place (1s):** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place (10s):** The digit '4' appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 blocks (including 440-449), each contributing 10, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place (100s):** Pages 400-488 have '4' in the hundreds place, totaling 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place (1s):** The digit '8' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place (10s):** The digit '8' appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. The last block is 480-488, contributing 9. Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place (100s):** No pages have '8' in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the number of '8's from the number of '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should think differently. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a formula or a different method to count digits. Let me try another approach for verification. For each digit position, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nLet's consider each digit place separately for 4 and 8.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n\n1. Units place:\n   - The number of 4's in the units place from 1 to N can be calculated as floor((N + 1)/10). For N=488, floor(489/10)=48. But wait, that would give 48, but earlier I thought it was 49. Hmm, maybe my initial approach was wrong. Wait, let me think: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then 14, 24,...,484. The sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, the formula floor((N + 1)/10) would give floor(488+1)/10=489/10=48.9, which is 48 when floored. But that's incorrect because we have 49 terms. So, perhaps the correct formula is floor((N - (digit))/10) +1. Hmm, maybe I should think differently. Alternatively, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is equal to the number of complete groups of 10, which is floor(N/10), plus 1 if the units digit is >=d. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is equal to the number of complete decades (each of 10 numbers) plus the remainder if the last number's units digit is >=d. So, for N=488, the number of complete decades is 48 (since 488/10=48.8, so 48 complete decades). Then, in the incomplete decade, the units digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last number). So, the digit 4 appears once in this incomplete decade (at 484). So total units place 4's: 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\n2. Tens place:\n   - The number of 4's in the tens place can be calculated by considering each block of 100 numbers. In each block, the tens digit cycles from 0-9, so each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 488, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 (since 400-499, but we only go up to 488). Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit goes from 0-4, but we're only considering up to 488. So, let's break it down:\n   - For hundreds digit 0 (1-99): the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers.\n   - For hundreds digit 1 (100-199): tens digit 4 in 140-149: 10\n   - Similarly, hundreds digits 2,3: each contributes 10\n   - For hundreds digit 4 (400-488): the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449. How many numbers? 440-449 is 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, 440-449 is entirely within 488, so 10 numbers.\n   So, total tens place 4's: 10 (for 0-99) +10 (100-199)+10(200-299)+10(300-399)+10(400-488)=50. Correct.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n\n1. Units place:\n   - Similar to 4's, the number of 8's in units place is calculated as:\n   - Complete decades: floor(488/10)=48\n   - In the incomplete decade (480-488), the units digits go from 0-8, so 8 appears once (at 488)\n   - So, total units place 8's: 48 +1=49\n\n2. Tens place:\n   - For each block of 100, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - From 1-99: 80-89:10\n   - 100-199:180-189:10\n   - 200-299:280-289:10\n   - 300-399:380-389:10\n   - 400-488:480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n   - So, total tens place 8's:10+10+10+10+9=49\n\n3. Hundreds place:\n   - As before, no numbers in 1-488 have hundreds digit 8, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe I was wrong, but after rechecking, it seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89 (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks each contribute 10 occurrences, and the last block contributes 9 (since we stop at 488).\n   - Total occurrences: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = **90**\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

This results in 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. This results in 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. The first four blocks each contribute 10 occurrences, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:** Subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's.\n   - Difference = 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, maybe I'm overcounting. Wait, let me think about the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. Now, for the 8's: - Units place: 8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers. Correct. - Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I feel like that might be a bit high. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. For the 8's, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about it differently, using a formula. The number of times a digit appears in each position can be calculated using a formula. For a digit d in a specific position (units, tens, hundreds), the count can be determined by looking at higher digits, current digit, and lower digits. Let me try that approach to confirm. For the digit 4: Let's go through each position.\n\n- **Units place:** The number of 4's is calculated as follows. The higher digits (hundreds and tens) can range from 0 to 4 (since 488 is the max). For each combination of higher digits, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, there are 10 numbers with 4 in the units place. So, from 0-488, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), and then 400-488. For each complete hundred, there are 10 numbers with 4 in the units place. So, 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the units digit cycles from 0-8, so 4 appears once in the units place (404, 414, etc., up to 484). Wait, actually, from 400-488, the units digit goes from 0-8, but how many times does 4 appear? It appears once every 10 numbers, so from 400-488, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 /10 =8 full cycles, each contributing one 4 in the units place, plus the 9th cycle which only goes up to 8, so no extra 4. So, 8*1=8. So, total units place 4's: 4*10 +8=48. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 49. Hmm, now I'm confused. Wait, maybe the formula is a bit different. Let me recall the formula for digit counting. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N is calculated as follows:\n\nLet me think of N as 488.\n\nFor the units digit:\n\nThe number of complete groups of 10 is floor(488 /10)=48. Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48. Then, in the incomplete group (480-488), the units digit goes from 0-8, so 4 appears once (at 484). So total units 4's:48 +1=49. Okay, so that matches my initial count. So, units place:49.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place:\n\nThe number of complete groups of 100 is floor(488 /100)=4. Each group contributes 10 4's in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 4*10=40. Then, in the incomplete group (400-488), the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, but since we're in 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8. So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 more. So total tens 4's:40 +10=50. That matches my initial count.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\nThe hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4. So, 89.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nNow, for the digit 8:\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: floor(488/10)=48. Each contributes one 8, so 48. In the incomplete group (480-488), the units digit goes from 0-8, so 8 appears once (at 488). So, units 8's:48 +1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 100: floor(488/100)=4. Each contributes 10 8's in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4*10=40. In the incomplete group (400-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, tens 8's:40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nSince 800-899 is beyond 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe 90 seems high, but after using the formula, I get the same result. So, maybe it's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should list out the counts again more carefully.\n\nLet me try to list the number of 4's and 8's in each position again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. So, from 0 to 484, how many numbers? The first is 4, the last is 484. The step is 10, so the number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place:8,18,28,...,488. So, from 8 to 488, step 10. Number of terms: ((488 -8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four is 10 numbers, the last is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place:0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place (Ones Place):** The digit '4' appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '4' appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '8' appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '8' appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last range being 480-488, contributing 9 numbers. Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is '8'.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of '8's from the total number of '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 times more than the digit '8'.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Hmm, maybe I'm overcounting the hundreds place. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89. So, yes, 89. Now, 8's: - Units:49, correct. - Tens:80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I feel like maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. Another way to count the 4's: Let's consider each digit position separately. For units, tens, and hundreds. For units digit: The number of 4's is equal to the number of complete groups of 10, plus any extra in the incomplete group. So, 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, and then in the last partial group (480-488), the units digit 4 appears once at 484. So, 48 +1=49. Correct. For tens digit: The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each 100 numbers, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, 488 /100=4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (400-488), the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, but wait, 400-488: the tens digit is 4 for 400-409 (10 numbers) and 440-449 (another 10). Wait, no, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409 (10) and 440-449 (10). So, that's 20 more. So, total tens digit 4's: 4*10 +20=60? Wait, that contradicts my earlier count of 50. Wait, no, I think I'm confusing something here. Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Let me try a different approach. The tens digit is 4 in the following ranges: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). But 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. So, that's correct. So, 50 in the tens place. Now, hundreds digit: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. Now, for 8's: Units place: same as 4's, 49. Tens place:80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

Hmm, but I'm a bit confused because 4's in hundreds place are from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, but 8's in tens place only go up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. Wait, but in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, the 4's have a significant advantage in the hundreds place. So, 90 seems correct. Wait, but let me think again. Wait, 488 is the last page, so in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4. That's a lot. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place, which is a big chunk. So, maybe 90 is correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the 8's in the tens place. Let me check that again. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, 49 in tens place. Units place:49, so total 98. 4's:188. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit '4' and '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit '4' appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit '4' appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** The digit '8' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit '8' appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488 (9 numbers). Total: 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** Subtract the number of '8's from '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."
