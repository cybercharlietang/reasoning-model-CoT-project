    "text": " Now, 8's: - Units: same logic, 8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, plus 1 is 49. Correct. - Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. - Hundreds: none. So total 8's:49+49=98. Thus, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check: 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I overcounted somewhere else. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a formula to calculate the number of times a digit appears in each position. Let me try that approach to verify. For a digit d in position p (units, tens, hundreds), the count can be calculated as follows: For units place: The number of times d appears is (n // 10) + 1 if the last digit is >=d, else (n //10). But wait, maybe it's better to use a more systematic approach. Let me think: For the units digit, the number of 4's is the number of complete groups of 10 in 488, which is 48, plus 1 if the last digit is >=4. Wait, no, actually, for units digit, it's (488 //10) + (1 if (488 %10) >=4 else 0). So, 488//10=48, 488%10=8, which is >=4, so 48+1=49. Correct. Similarly, for tens digit: The number of 4's in tens place is calculated by looking at higher digits and lower digits. The formula is: higher = n // 100, current = (n //10) %10, lower = n %10. If current >4: count += (higher +1)*10\nIf current ==4: count += (higher +1)*10 + lower +1\nIf current <4: count += higher *10\n\nSo, for 4's in tens place for 488:\nhigher = 488 //100 =4\ncurrent = (488//10)%10=8\nlower=488%10=8\n\nSince current=8 >4, count += (4+1)*10=50. So, 50 fours in tens place. Correct.\n\nFor hundreds place, 4's: The hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits place: Using the formula, higher =488//10=48, current=8, lower=8.\n\nWait, no, for units place, the formula is similar to 4's. Wait, actually, perhaps it's better to just count as before.\n\nAlternatively, let me use the formula for 8's in units place:\n\nhigher =488//10=48, current=8, lower=8.\n\nWait, no, the formula is: for units digit, number of 8's is (n //10) + (1 if (n %10) >=8 else 0). So, 488//10=48, 488%10=8, which is >=8, so 48+1=49. Correct.\n\nFor tens place, 8's: Using the formula:\n\nhigher =488//100=4\ncurrent=(488//10)%10=8\nlower=488%10=8\n\nSince current=8, count += (higher +1)*10 + (lower +1). Wait, no, the formula is:\n\nIf current >8: count += (higher +1)*10\nIf current ==8: count += (higher +1)*10 + (lower +1)\nIf current <8: count += higher*10\n\nBut wait, 8 is the digit we're looking for, so:\n\nIf current >8: but 8 is the highest single digit, so current can't be >8. So, if current=8, then count += (higher +1)*10 + (lower +1). Wait, but in our case, higher=4, current=8, lower=8.\n\nSo, count += (4+1)*10 + (8 +1) =5*10 +9=50+9=59? Wait, that can't be right because earlier I counted 49 eights in the tens place. Hmm, maybe I'm misapplying the formula. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me think. For the tens place, the number of times 8 appears is calculated by:\n\n- The higher part: numbers before the current hundred. So, for 488, higher is 4 (since 400-499 is the current hundred). The current digit is 8 in the tens place.\n\nSo, the count for tens place 8's is:\n\nIf the current digit is greater than 8: (higher +1)*10\nIf equal to 8: higher*10 + (lower +1)\nIf less than 8: higher*10\n\nWait, but 8 is the digit, so:\n\nIf current >8: not possible, since digits go up to 9, but 8 is the digit we're looking for.\n\nIf current ==8: count += (higher)*10 + (lower +1). Wait, no, perhaps it's (higher)*10 + (lower +1). Wait, but in our case, higher=4, current=8, lower=8.\n\nSo, count += 4*10 + (8 +1)=40 +9=49. Which matches our earlier count. So, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nSo, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) =98. Correct.\n\nSo, 4's:188, 8's:98. Difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first thought about it, I thought maybe the answer would be different, but this seems consistent.\n\nWait, let me check the hundreds place for 8's again. Since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers from 800-899, so no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights there.\n\nSo, yes, total eights:98, fours:188. Difference:90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place (Ones Place):** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '4' appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 sets of 10 numbers each, totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '8' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '8' appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, etc. The last set is 480-488, giving 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers with '8' in the hundreds place (800-899 exceeds 488).\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a formula or another method to verify.

So, in each hundred block except the last one, there are 10 numbers with tens digit 4. The last block, 400-488, has 10 numbers (440-449) with tens digit 4, and then 450-488 don't have 4 in the tens place. So, total tens place 4's: 4 sets (each 10) plus 10 in 440-449, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So, 89. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 8 more than 480, which is 48*10=480. So, 488 is 488=48*10 +8, so the number of terms is 48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. Correct. So, 49+49=98. Therefore, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when counting in hundreds, maybe I missed something. Let me check the hundreds place for 4's: 400-488. That's 488-400+1=89. Correct. And for 8's, no hundreds place. So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, I think my calculation is correct.

    "text": " Now, 8's: - Units: same as 4's, 49. - Tens: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10*4=40 +9=49. So, 49 in tens place. Correct. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188 -98=90. Hmm, so the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. Is there any chance I double-counted or missed something? Let me consider the 4's in the hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. The 4's in the tens place: each hundred has a 40-49, so 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Correct. Units place: same as 8's, 49. So, 188. 8's: units 49, tens 49, total 98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right. I think I did it correctly.

There are 49 such numbers (from 4 to 484, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal number of 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place for every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges each contribute 10 numbers, and the last contributes 9 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8.\n\nTotal number of 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"
