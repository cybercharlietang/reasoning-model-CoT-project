Hmm, that seems right, but let me just think if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, I could calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position. For units and tens, the approach is similar. For hundreds, it's different because the range is up to 488. So, perhaps another way to think about it is: For units digit: in every 10 numbers, each digit 0-9 appears once. So, total units digits from 1-488: 488 numbers. So, units digits: 488 /10 =48.8, but since we can't have a fraction, the number of complete groups of 10 is 48, each contributing one 4 and one 8. So, 48 fours and 48 eights. But then, we have 8 extra numbers (since 488 = 48*10 +8). So, the last 8 numbers are 481-488. In these, the units digits are 1-8. So, in the units place, we have an extra 4 (at 484) and an extra 8 (at 488). So, units place: 48+1=49 fours, 48+1=49 eights. That's consistent with earlier. For tens place: Similarly, every 100 numbers, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 488 /100 =4.88, so 4 complete hundreds. Each contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 fours, 4*10=40 eights. Then, the remaining 88 numbers (from 400-488) need to be considered. In these, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 for each hundred. But since we're only going up to 488, the tens digits in 400-488 are 0-8 (since 488 is the last number). So, in the tens place for 400-488: how many fours and eights? Let's see: 400-409: tens digit 0\n410-419: tens digit 1\n420-429: tens digit 2\n430-439: tens digit 3\n440-449: tens digit 4\n450-459: tens digit5\n460-469: tens digit6\n470-479: tens digit7\n480-488: tens digit8\n\nSo, in the tens place in 400-488:\n- 440-449: 10 fours\n- 480-488: 9 eights\n\nSo, in the tens place for the last partial hundred (400-488), we have 10 fours and 9 eights.\n\nTherefore, total tens place:\nfours: 4*10 +10=50\neights:4*10 +9=49\n\nWhich matches our earlier count.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds place:\n\nNumbers where hundreds digit is 4: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nNumbers where hundreds digit is 8: none, since the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) =188\n\nTotal eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nSo, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place (Ones Place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers (since 484 is the 49th occurrence).\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488), totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., but the last block (480-488) has only 9 numbers. Thus, 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 90 times more than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Correct. Now, the 8's: - Units place:8,18,...,488. 488 is included, so 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Correct. - Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. - Hundreds place: none. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188 -98=90. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check again. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, which is 10 numbers, then 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, 98 eights. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is indeed 90. Wait, but I feel like that's a lot. Let me think if there's another way to approach this, maybe using digit positions more systematically. Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position. For a number from 1 to N, the number of times a digit appears in each position can be calculated using a formula, but since N is 488, maybe it's easier to count manually as I did. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a more mathematical approach for each digit position. Let me try that for both 4 and 8.\n\nFor the units digit:\n\nIn the units place, each digit from 0-9 appears equally often in each block of 10 numbers. So, for each block of 10, each digit appears once. The number of complete blocks in 488 is 48 full blocks (since 48*10=480), and then 8 more numbers (481-488). So, for the units digit, the digit 4 appears 48 times in the complete blocks (since each block has one 4 in the units place), plus one more in the incomplete block (484). So, 48 +1=49. Similarly, for the digit 8, in each block of 10, it appears once. So, 48 times in the complete blocks, plus once in the incomplete block (488). So, 48 +1=49. So, units place: 49 fours, 49 eights.\n\nFor the tens digit:\n\nEach digit appears 10 times in each block of 100. So, for the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each 100 numbers. So, for 488, we have 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 80-88 in the next hundred. Wait, actually, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88. So, for the tens digit:\n\n- In 0-99: tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n- Similarly, in 100-199: tens digit 4 appears 10 times (140-149), and 8 appears 10 times (180-189).\n- In 200-299: tens digit 4 appears 10 times (240-249), and 8 appears 10 times (280-289).\n- In 300-399: tens digit 4 appears 10 times (340-349), and 8 appears 10 times (380-389).\n- Now, in 400-488: the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 times. Similarly, digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens digit in 400-488: 10 fours and 9 eights.\n\nSo, total for tens digit:\n\nFours: 4 hundreds *10 +10 (from 440-449) = 50.\n\nEights: 4 hundreds *10 +9 (from 480-488) = 49.\n\nWait, that's different from my initial count where I had 50 fours and 49 eights in the tens place. Hmm, but when I added earlier, I had 50 fours and 49 eights in the tens place, which seems correct. So, that's consistent.\n\nFor the hundreds digit:\n\nIn the hundreds place, digit 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (488 -400 +1=89). So, 89 fours.\n\nDigit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so hundreds digits go up to 4. So, zero eights here.\n\nSo, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 188.\n\nTotal eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) =98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 90 seemed high, but after double-checking, it seems correct. Let me think again: 4 appears 188 times, 8 appears 98 times, so 90 more 4's. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't overcount in the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, and 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 10 fours and 9 eights.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last which contributes 9.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, yes, 49 in tens place for 8's. So, total 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 sets: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each set contributes 10 numbers except the last set, which contributes 9: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No pages have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Let me see if there's another way to approach this, maybe by using a formula or a different counting method. Alternatively, I could consider each digit position separately and calculate the number of times each digit appears. For the units place, the number of times a digit d appears is floor(n/10) + (1 if the remainder is >= d else 0). Wait, but that's for when d is less than the digit in the current position. Maybe it's better to stick with the method I used earlier, which seems to work. Alternatively, using a more systematic approach: For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear. Let's try that for 4's: Units place: For each complete set of 10 numbers, 4 appears once. The number of complete sets in 488 pages is 48 full sets (1-480), each contributing 1 four in the units place, and then 481-488, where 484 has a 4 in the units place. So, 48 +1=49 fours in units. Tens place: For each complete set of 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49). There are 4 complete sets (1-400), each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens place can be 0-8. The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40+10=50 fours in tens place. Hundreds place: From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours. Total fours:49+50+89=188. Same as before. For 8's: Units place: Each 10 numbers, 8 appears once. 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full sets, and then 8 in 488. So, 48+1=49. Tens place: For each 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89). There are 4 complete sets (1-400), contributing 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 40+9=49. Hundreds place: 800-899, but we only go up to 488, so 0. Total eights:49+49=98. So, same result. Therefore, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90.
