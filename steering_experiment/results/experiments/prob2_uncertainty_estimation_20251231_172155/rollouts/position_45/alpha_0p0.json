    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 380-389 is okay, but 480-489 would be next, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40 plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Counting fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. Counting eights: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me think again about the tens place for eights. When I considered the tens digit as 8, I included 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place for that set. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. For fours, in the tens place, I considered 440-449 as the last set, which is 10 numbers, so 5 sets of 10, making 50. That seems correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

So, that's 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 =49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10=40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49 =98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, we subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours -98 eights =90.

So, let's count each block. 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers.

So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, subtracting the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check my calculations again. For the units place of 4's: I thought it was 49, but let me confirm. From 4 to 484, stepping by 10: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, correct. Tens place for 4's: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. For the eights: units place: 8,18,28,...,488. That's 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total eights: 49+49=98. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I subtract, I get 90, but I thought maybe I made a mistake in counting. Let me check the hundreds place for eights again. Since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers from 800 onwards, so no eights in the hundreds place. So, correct, 0. So, total eights are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) =98. So, 188-98=90.

Let's count how many numbers in each set. Each full set (like 80-89) has 10 numbers, so that's 10 eights in the tens place. There are four full sets: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 sets \u00d710 =40 eights. Now, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place.

Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I thought maybe the hundreds place for fours was 89, which is correct because from 400 to 488 is 89 numbers. Wait, but when I was counting the tens place for fours, I had 5 sets: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set is 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. That's correct.

Units place for eights: from 8 to 488, every 10 numbers, which is 49 numbers. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that I double-counted any numbers?

Let me count the number of tens digits that are 8. From 0-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, and the last block has 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct. Similarly, for fours in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct.

Wait, 480-489 would be the next set, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488. So, let's count each block. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, let me check again. Units:49, tens:49, so total eights are 98. Hmm, but wait, when I counted the tens place, I included 480-488 as 9 numbers. Let me confirm that: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers, so yes, 9 eights in the tens place for that block. So, 49 eights in units, 49 in tens, total 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, total 98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me double-check the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. Yes, that's correct. And in the tens place for fours, we had 50 fours, which comes from 5 sets of 10 numbers each (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449). Each set contributes 10 fours, so 5x10=50. Units place for fours: 49, because from 4,14,...,484, which is 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Wait, but 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, yes, 49 fours in units. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights, units place: 49, which is from 8,18,...,488. So, 488 is the 49th occurrence. Tens place: 49, because 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.

Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 380-389 is okay, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8. Let me count: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, 80-89 is 10, same for 180-189, etc., but 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Units place:49, tens place:49, so total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through the 4's again. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. From 4 to 484, step 10. Number of terms: (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place:400-488:89 numbers. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. Now, for the 8's. Units place:8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10. Number of terms: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place:0. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in the tens place for 8's? For example, in the hundreds place, when considering 480-488, that's 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488. So, 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, 480-488 contributes 9 eights in the tens place. So, adding up: 10 (from 80-89) +10 (180-189)+10 (280-289)+10 (380-389)+9 (480-488)=49. Correct. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90.

Because 488 is the last page. So, in each hundred block, except the last one, there are 10 numbers with tens digit 8, and in the last block (400-488), it's 9 numbers because 489 would be beyond 488.

Let me break it down: Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10.

So, total eights in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four sets contribute 40, and the last set contributes 9, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.

From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (since 488-480+1=9). So, in the tens place, we have 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights? Wait, no. Wait, the 480-488 block is part of the 400-488 range, so the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 in 9 numbers. So, total eights in the tens place: 10 (from 80-89) +10 (180-189)+10 (280-289)+10 (380-389) +9 (480-488) = 49.

So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct because 488-400+1=89. For the tens place of fours, we had 5 sets of 10: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Units place: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, 4,14,24,...484. How many terms? Let's see: 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 48 full steps, but since we include both endpoints, it's 49 terms. So, units place is 49 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights, units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is the 49th term because (488-8)/10=48, so 48+1=49. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

Therefore, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more fours than eights, subtract the total eights from total fours: 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.
