Let's count how many sets of 10 there are. From 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yep, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98.

Yes, 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, the tens place 8 is from 480-488. So, each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place.

So, how many numbers in each set? Each full set (like 80-89) has 10 numbers, so 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 489 is beyond 488. So, that's 4 full sets (40) plus 9, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place.

So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct.

Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488).

Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place, right? So, yes, 49 in total. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

For eights in the tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place: both fours and eights have 49 each. So, 49+49=98 eights total. 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

Wait, 480-489 would be the next set, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8 in the hundreds place. Let me count each block. Each 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 8, which is 10 numbers. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 eights in the tens place, and the last block (480-488) has 9. So total eights in the tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) =98. Wait, let me check that. Units:49, tens:49, so 49+49=98. So, the number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) -98 (eights)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.

So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For the hundreds place in fours, I counted from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, correct. For the tens place in fours, I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50, correct. Units place fours: up to 484, which is 49 numbers, correct. For eights, units place up to 488, which is 49, correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488, which is 10+10+10+10+9=49, correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in different places, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me try another approach. Maybe I can count the number of times each digit appears in each position. For units place: For 4's, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so total numbers = floor(488/10) + (if 488 mod 10 >=4, then 1 else 0). Wait, 488/10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. Since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is greater than or equal to 4, so we add 1, making it 49. So, 49 fours in units place. Similarly, for 8's in units place: same calculation. floor(488/10)=48, 488 mod10=8>=8, so add 1, total 49. So that's correct. For tens place: For 4's, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's every 100 numbers, 10 times each. So, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so yes, 50. For 8's in tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 49. That's correct. For hundreds place: 4's: 400-488: 89 numbers. 8's: 800-899, but book ends at 488, so 0. So, 89 fours in hundreds place, 0 eights. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Total eights:49+49+0=98. So, 188-98=90.

But our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 would have 8 in the tens place. So, how many sets are there? Each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, as 488 -480 +1=9). Wait, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, total eights in the tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 =49. Wait, is that right? Let me think again. Each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one, which only goes up to 488. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Wait, but 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total eights in the tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that can't be right because 188-98 is 90, but let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through the fours again: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm wondering if I counted correctly in the hundreds place for fours. Wait, from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct. For the tens place in fours, I had 50, which comes from 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50. That seems right. For eights in the tens place, I had 49 because the last set was 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 4 full sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49. That seems correct. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, it's easy to miscount, especially with inclusive ranges. Let me try another approach for the hundreds place in fours: from 400 to 488, how many numbers? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct. For the tens place in fours, each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place. From 1-400, how many hundreds? 400 is the last page, so the hundreds are 1-399, and 400-488. Wait, but 1-399 includes 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 340-349. So, 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, 400-488: the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours:40+10=50. That's correct. So, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the units place for eights. Let me check that again. Units place for eights: from 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The last term is 488, which is 8*61=488? Wait, 8*61 is 488? Wait, 8*60=480, so 8*61=488. So, the number of terms is 61? Wait, that contradicts my earlier count of 49. Wait, no, because 8,18,...,488 is every 10 numbers starting at 8. So, the sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 terms. So, units place eights:49. That's correct. So, my initial count was right. Therefore, the difference is 90. Wait, but I just thought, 488 is the last page, so when counting the units place for eights, 488 is included, so that's correct. Similarly, for fours, 484 is included in the units place. So, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98, so 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

Let me count how many sets there are. Each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last one which might be incomplete. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me make sure. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49.

So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49+49=98. Hmm, so number of 4's is 188, and number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me double-check my counting for the eights in the tens place. When I count 80-89, that's 10 eights in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, each of these contributes one 8, so 9 eights. So, total in tens place is 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. So, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. Now, fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. So, 188-98=90.
