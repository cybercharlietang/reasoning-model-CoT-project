Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit being 8. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks are there? From 1-400, there are 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389). Each contributes 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 in 9 numbers (480-488). So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That's correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. When I counted from 80-89, that's 10 numbers. Similarly, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each 10. So that's 4 sets, 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so total tens 8's:40+9=49. That seems correct. Units place: from 8,18,...488, which is 49 numbers. So, 49+49=98. Yes, that's correct. So, the difference is 188-98=90.

Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block from 80-89, 180-189, etc., gives 10 numbers. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the units place for 4's: from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers. So, 484 is 48*10 +4, so that's 49 numbers, correct. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, so 50 fours, correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. For eights: units place: 8,18,...488. 488 is 48*10 +8, so that's 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49+49=98 eights.

Wait, no, 480-489 is 10 numbers, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how does that affect the count? Let me think. Each block of 100 numbers has a set where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-400, there are four blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10 eights. That's 4*10=40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 9 more eights in the tens place.

Let me calculate how many numbers are in each set. Each full set like 80-89 has 10 numbers, so that's 10 eights in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, how many eights in the tens place here? Each of these 9 numbers has an 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Let me see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: number of 4's (188) minus number of 8's (98) equals 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. For the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. That's correct. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The last term is 484. The sequence is 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So, 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 fours in units place. That's correct. For eights: units place is 8,18,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 8 + 10*(n-1)=488. So, 10*(n-1)=480, n-1=48, n=49. So, 49 eights in units place. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, total eights:49+49=98.

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me check that again. Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. Yes, that seems correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) -98 (eights)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (including both ends). So, each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, so that's 4*10=40. Then, the last set 480-488 is 9 numbers. So total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when counting the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers. Let me confirm: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers, correct. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) plus 9, so 49. So, 49 in tens place, and 49 in units place, total 98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, it's easy to miscount. Let me try another approach for the units place. For units place, the number of 4's from 1 to 488: The pattern repeats every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full cycles of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. Then, in the last partial cycle, from 481-488, the units digit is 8, so no additional 4. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 49. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there. Let me recalculate the units place for 4's. The units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each 10 numbers, the units digit is 4 exactly once. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so no additional 4. So, total units place 4's: 48. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 49. Which is correct? Let me check with actual numbers. The first 4 is at 4, which is in the first set (1-10). The last 4 in the units place would be at 484, which is the 48th set (480-489), but since we only go up to 488, 484 is included. So, 48 sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is the last 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. So, units place 4's:48. Similarly, for 8's in the units place: from 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? The last 8 is at 488. So, same as before: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit 8 is included, so that's one more, making it 49. Wait, so for 4's in units place, it's 48, and for 8's, it's 49. That contradicts my earlier count where I thought units place for 4's was 49. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify: when counting the number of times a digit appears in the units place, it's the number of complete decades (sets of 10) plus any additional in the partial set. So, for 4's: number of complete decades is floor(488/10)=48. In each complete decade, there's one 4 in the units place. So, 48. Then, check the partial decade: 481-488. The units digits here are 1-8, so no 4. So, total units place 4's:48. Similarly, for 8's: number of complete decades is 48, each contributing one 8 in units place, so 48. Then, the partial decade 481-488 includes 488, which has an 8 in units place, so that's one more, making it 49. So, units place 4's:48, units place 8's:49. That changes things. So, earlier, I thought units place 4's were 49, but actually, it's 48. So, let me recalculate the total number of 4's and 8's. For 4's: units place 48, tens place: let's see, earlier I thought it was 50. Let me check that again. Tens place 4's: numbers where the tens digit is 4. These are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. So, total 4's: units 48 + tens 50 + hundreds 89 = 48+50=98 +89=187. Wait, earlier I had 188, but now it's 187. Because units place was 48 instead of 49. So, 48+50=98, plus 89=187. Now, for 8's: units place 49, tens place: let's recount. Tens place 8's: numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each of the first four sets (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last set, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, 40+9=49. So, tens place 8's:49. Hundreds place 8's:0. So, total 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98. So, 4's:187, 8's:98. So, the difference is 187-98=89. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 90. So, now I'm getting 89. Hmm, which is correct? Let me check again. Units place 4's:48. Tens place 4's:50. Hundreds place 4's: from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89. So, 89. So, 48+50=98, +89=187. 8's: units 49, tens 49, total 98. So, 187-98=89. So, the correct difference is 89. So, I think earlier I made a mistake in counting the units place 4's as 49 instead of 48. So, the correct answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place (Ones Place):** The digit '4' appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

There are 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1), each contributing one '4' in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total '4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place (Ones Place):** The digit '8' appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 48 complete sets of 10, contributing 48 '8's. The last partial set includes 488, adding one more '8', totaling 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '8' appears in the tens place in numbers 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four sets contribute 40 '8's, and the last set contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers with '8' in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of '8's from the total number of '4's: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe digit '4' is printed 89 more times than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 -480 +1=9. So, total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9=49.

Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, let me just go through again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188.

So, yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Let's see how many full sets there are. Each 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 8, which is 10 numbers each. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers, because 488 -480 +1=9. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, etc.) each contribute 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more fours than eights. So, fours are 188, eights are 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me just double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit is 8 in all these 9 numbers, adding 9 more eights.

So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except maybe the last one. Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, so 49+49=98. Hmm, but wait, let me check the tens place again. For the tens digit being 8, in the 480-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's correct. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488), totaling 49. So, 49 in tens place, 49 in units place, 0 in hundreds place, so total 98 eights. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit position again for both 4's and 8's. For fours: Units place: 4,14,...,484. That's (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488:89 numbers. So, 89. Total:49+50+89=188. For eights: Units place:8,18,...,488. That's (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89:10,180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, since 800>488. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit):** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). The count is calculated as (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit):** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges up to 440-449. Total count = 5 * 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit):** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). Count = (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each range contributes 10 numbers, with the last range being 480-488 (9 numbers).

Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, so 4 blocks x10 =40. Then, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers.

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so does it include 480-489? Yes, 480-488 is part of the page numbers. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but in the tens place, 480-488 has 8 in the tens place for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks * 10 = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 8's in the tens place. From 1-400, there are 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 40+9=49. That seems correct. Similarly, for the units place, 488 is included, so 49 eights. So, 49+49=98 eights. And for fours, we had 188. So, 188-98=90.

Now, the book ends at 488, so 380-389 is included, but 480-489 isn't fully included because the book stops at 488. So, from 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets of 10, so 40 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the book. So, in the tens place, 480-488 has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (480,481,...,488). So, that's an additional 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights would be 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, 40 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but I thought 480-488 is part of the hundreds digit 4, so does that affect the count? Let me think. The tens digit is 8 in 480-488, so that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 40, but now adding 9 more makes it 49. Hmm, that seems a bit high. Let me check again. From 0-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49.

Let me just quickly verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188.

So, 0 eights here. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, right? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct. For the tens place, fours: each hundred block has 10 fours in the tens place, and there are 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Units place: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. 484-4=480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 gives 49. So, 49 fours in the units place. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. For eights: units place, 8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, plus 1=49. So, 49 eights in units. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. So, total eights: 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   - Number of terms: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49  \n   - **Total 4's in units place:** 49\n\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.  \n   - Each block contributes 10, and there are 5 such blocks.  \n   - **Total 4's in tens place:** 5 \u00d7 10 = 50\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488.  \n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89  \n   - **Total 4's in hundreds place:** 89\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   - Number of terms: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49  \n   - **Total 8's in units place:** 49\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.  \n   - Each full block contributes 10, and the last block contributes 9.  \n   - **Total 8's in tens place:** 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any page number up to 488.  \n   - **Total 8's in hundreds place:** 0\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

So, each block except the last one has 10 numbers. Let's count them: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights here. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.

So, each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, and the last block (480-488) has 9 numbers. So, that's 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

So, let's count each block. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but wait: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8.
