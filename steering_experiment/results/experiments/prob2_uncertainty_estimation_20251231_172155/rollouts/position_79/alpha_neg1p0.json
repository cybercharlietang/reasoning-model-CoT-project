    "text": " So, that seems correct. Let me think if there's another way to approach this, maybe by considering each digit position separately and calculating the number of times each digit appears. For the 4's: - Units: floor(488/10) + (488 mod 10 >=4 ? 1 :0). Wait, 488/10=48.8, so floor is 48. But since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so units place 4's:48 +1=49. Correct. - Tens: floor(488/100)*10 + something. Wait, for the tens place, it's a bit more involved. Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. There are floor(488/100)=4 full hundreds (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). Wait, actually, floor(488/100)=4, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 numbers. But in the 400-488 block, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, 410-419, etc., up to 440-449, but 450-488 would have different tens digits. Wait, no, actually, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 for each hundred. So, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 4*10 +10=50. Correct. - Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. Total 4's:49+50+89=188. For 8's: - Units: floor(488/10)=48, and since 488 mod10=8>=8, so 48+1=49. Correct. - Tens: floor(488/100)=4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 numbers where tens digit is 8 (80-89, etc.). But in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's:4*10 +9=49. Correct. - Hundreds: 0, as before. Total 8's:49+49=98.
