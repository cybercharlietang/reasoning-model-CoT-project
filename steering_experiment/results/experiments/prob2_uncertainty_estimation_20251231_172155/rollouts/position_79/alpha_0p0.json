    "text": " That seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this, maybe using digit positions and place values. For example, for each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear. Alternatively, maybe using a formula for each digit. Let me try that for cross-verification. The formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is floor((N - d)/10) +1. Similarly, for the tens place, it's floor((N - d*10)/100)*10 + min(max(N - d*10,0), 10). Wait, maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, for each digit position, we can calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear. Let me try that for units place: For 4 in units place: The number of times is floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is greater than or equal to 4, we add 1. So, 48 +1=49. Similarly for 8 in units place: floor(488/10)=48, and 488 mod 10=8, which is equal to 8, so we add 1, making it 49. That matches our earlier counts. Now, for the tens place: For 4 in tens place: The formula is a bit trickier. The number of times 4 appears in the tens place is calculated by considering each hundred block. Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 40-49, 140-149, etc. Since 488 is less than 500, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, 5 hundreds blocks. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Similarly, for 8 in tens place: The hundreds blocks are 0,1,2,3,4. Each contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so 5*10=50. But wait, in our earlier count, we had 49 eights in the tens place because the last set (480-488) only has 9 numbers. So, perhaps the formula isn't directly applicable here because the last hundred block (400-488) doesn't complete the full 10 numbers. Wait, no, actually, when considering the tens digit, each hundred block has exactly 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except when the upper limit is less than the next block. Wait, in our case, the last hundred block is 400-488. So, for the tens digit 8, the numbers would be 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, in the hundreds block 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times instead of 10. Therefore, the total number of 8's in the tens place is 4*10 +9=49. So, the formula would adjust for the last block if the upper limit is less than the next multiple of 100. So, in this case, for 8 in tens place, it's 4 full hundreds (0-399) each contributing 10, and the last hundred (400-488) contributing 9, so 4*10 +9=49. That's correct. Similarly, for 4 in the tens place, all hundreds blocks (0-499) have full 10 numbers, but since our upper limit is 488, the last block (400-488) still has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (440-449). So, 5 hundreds blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. Correct. Now, for the hundreds place: For 4 in hundreds place: It's from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. For 8 in hundreds place: It's from 800-899, but our upper limit is 488, so 0 times. So, that's correct. So, using this method, we get the same counts as before: 188 fours and 98 eights. Therefore, the difference is 188-98=90. So, I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\)\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers within each hundred (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).  \n   - Number of blocks: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449)  \n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences.  \n   - Total: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\)\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in numbers 400-488.  \n   - Total numbers: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\)\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\)\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\)\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers within each hundred (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).  \n   - Full blocks: 4 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389)  \n   - Partial block (480-488): 9 occurrences  \n   - Total: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\)\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Total: 0\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\)\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = \\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"
