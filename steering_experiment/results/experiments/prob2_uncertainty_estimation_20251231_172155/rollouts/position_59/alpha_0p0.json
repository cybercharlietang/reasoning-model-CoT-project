    "text": " Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit place again for both 4's and 8's. For 4's: Units:49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. Total 188. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but wait, when I counted the tens place for 4's, I considered up to 440-449, which is correct because 449 is within 488. For 8's, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, which is correct because 488 is the last page, so 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers. So, yes, 49 in units, 49 in tens, total 98 eights. So, the difference is 90. But wait, let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly for 4's? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct because 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Units place: 49 fours. Tens place:50 fours. So, 49+50=99, plus 89=188. That's correct. For 8's, units place:49, tens place:49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count any numbers or miss any edge cases. For example, in the units place, when counting 4's, the last number is 484, which is correct. For 8's, the last number in the units place is 488, which is included. In the tens place for 8's, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, I think my counts are accurate.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct.

    "text": " Let me go through my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the fours: units place was 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, totaling 188. For the eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, totaling 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, seems correct. Maybe I can think of another way to count. Alternatively, I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately by considering each digit place more carefully. Let me try that again. For the fours: Units place: from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place. The first is 4, then every 10 numbers. So, 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: numbers where tens digit is 4. These are 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block of 100 has 10 such numbers. From 0-488, how many blocks? 4 blocks (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). Wait, actually, 400-488 is part of the fifth block, but the tens digit being 4 occurs in 40-49,140-149, etc. So, in 0-99: 40-49:10 numbers\nIn 100-199:140-149:10\nIn 200-299:240-249:10\nIn 300-399:340-349:10\nIn 400-488:440-449:10 (since 440-449 is within 488)\nWait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Hundreds place: numbers from 400-488. That's 488-400+1=89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. That's correct. Now, for the eights: Units place: 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is ((488-8)/10)+1=(480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in units place. Tens place: numbers where tens digit is 8. These are 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each block except the last has 10 numbers, but the last block (480-488) has only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 80-89:10\n180-189:10\n280-289:10\n380-389:10\n480-488:9\nTotal:10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. Hundreds place: no eights, as before. So, total eights:49+49=98.

So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place (Ones Place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total Fours:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each range contributes 10 numbers, except the last one (480-488), which has 9. Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total Eights:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. So, 89 fours there. So, 188 fours in total. For eights, I think I might have missed something in the tens place. Let me recount the tens place for eights. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, and the last set has 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, 49 in tens place, 49 in units place, total 98 eights. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms (from 4 to 484, stepping by 10).\n   \n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each set contributes 10 fours, totaling 50 fours.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal number of 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This sequence has 49 terms.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four sets contribute 10 eights each, and the last set (480-488) contributes 9 eights, totaling 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal number of 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n\nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"
