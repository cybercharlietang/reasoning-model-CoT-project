Hmm, maybe that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Let me check that again. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, that's correct. For the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. Units place: every 10 numbers, starting at 4, so 4,14,...,484. How many terms? From 0 to 484, that's 484/10 +1 = 48.4, but since 484 is included, it's 49. So, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 188 total fours. Eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 98 total eights. So, 188 -98=90. So, the answer should be 90.

Each of the first four blocks is 10 numbers, and the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, as the book ends at 488. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.

    "text": " Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488 inclusive. 488 - 400 +1 =89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct. For the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. That's correct. Units place: every 10 numbers, so 488/10=48.8, so 49 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights, units place: 49, tens place:49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again. When counting the tens place for eights, I included 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct because 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 9. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90. But wait, let me think again. Wait, in the units place for eights, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The nth term is 8 +10(n-1). So, 8 +10(n-1)=488. 10(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 terms. Correct. Similarly, for the tens place, 80-89,180-189,...,480-488. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. Total 49. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. So, the answer is 90. I think that's correct.

There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** '4' appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set contributes 10, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** '4' appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Count the number of '8's:**\n   - **Units place:** '8' appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** '8' appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The last set has 9 numbers, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No '8's since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's - Number of '8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets of 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, for the eights. Units place: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Hmm, that seems right, but I'm a bit unsure. Let me think if I considered all the cases correctly. Wait, in the tens place for eights, I included 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, that's correct. Similarly, for fours in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers. Yes, because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, that's correct. So, the difference is 188-98=90.

    "text": " Let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's recount the fours: Units place: from 4,14,...,484. The last page is 488, so 484 is included. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So units:49. Tens place:40-49 (10),140-149(10),240-249(10),340-349(10),440-449(10). That's 5 sets, each 10, so 50. Hundreds place:400-488. 488-400+1=89. So 89. Total fours:49+50+89=188. That seems correct. Now, eights: Units:8,18,...,488. 488 is the last page. The number of terms is (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So units:49. Tens place:80-89 (10),180-189(10),280-289(10),380-389(10),480-488 (9). So 10+10+10+10+9=49. So eights:49+49=98. So 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Hmm, I think that's correct. Maybe I can think of a different way to count. Alternatively, maybe using a formula for each digit position. For units place in a range from 1 to N, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place is floor((N + 1) / 10). But in our case, for 4 in units place, N=488, so floor((488+1)/10)=floor(489/10)=48. But wait, that's 48, but earlier I counted 49. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake there. Wait, let me see. The formula is floor((N - d)/10) +1, where d is the digit we're looking for in the units place. So for d=4, it's floor((488 -4)/10)+1= floor(484/10)+1=48+1=49. So that matches. Similarly, for 8 in units place: floor((488-8)/10)+1= floor(480/10)+1=48+1=49. So that's correct. So units place for both 4 and 8 is 49. For tens place, the formula is similar but considering the tens digit. The number of times a digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to N can be calculated by considering each hundred block. For each hundred block (like 0-99, 100-199, etc.), the digit d appears 10 times in the tens place. So for N=488, the hundreds digit can go up to 4 (since 488 is in the 400s). So for the tens digit, the number of times d appears is: For each hundred block, if the current hundred is less than the hundreds part of N, then add 10. If the current hundred is equal to the hundreds part of N, then add min(10, (N % 100) +1). Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of how many full hundreds we have and then the partial. Let me try for 4 in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, etc. So in each hundred block, there's 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. From 1 to 488, how many complete hundreds do we have? 4 complete hundreds: 0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399, and 400-488. So in each of the first four hundreds (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399), there's 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. That's 4*10=40. Now, in the last hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. So that's 10 numbers. So total tens digit 4's:40+10=50. That's correct. Similarly, for 8 in the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89,180-189, etc. So in each hundred block, 10 numbers. From 0-99:80-89 (10). 100-199:180-189 (10). 200-299:280-289 (10). 300-399:380-389 (10). 400-488:480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers. So total tens digit 8's:4*10 +9=49. So that's correct. Now, hundreds digit for 4: as we saw earlier, from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So 89 fours in the hundreds place. Hundreds digit for 8: since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s, so 0. So total fours:49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188. Total eights:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98. So the difference is 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 numbers, totaling 5 sets: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four sets contribute 10 each, last set contributes 9: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in any page number (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Number of 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the fours: units place, I counted 49, which I think is correct because from 4 to 484, stepping by 10, that's 49 numbers. Tens place: 5 sets of 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. 49+50+89=188. That seems right. For the eights: units place is 49, same as fours. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, but does 400 count? Yes, because page 400 is included. So, 488-400+1=89. That's correct. For the eights, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, the difference is 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again. When counting the units place for fours, I had 49, but does 488 have a 4 in the units place? No, 488 has an 8 in the units place. Wait, the last number with a 4 in the units place before 488 is 484. So, 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, that's correct. Similarly, for eights, the last occurrence in the units place is 488, which is the 49th. So, that's correct. So, yeah, I think the difference is 90.

So, 480 is the first, 488 is the last, so 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9. So, that's correct. Similarly, in the units place, 488 is included, so that's correct. Okay, I think that's right.

Hundreds place: from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct.

When counting the tens place, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. That seems correct. And in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Units place: from 4, 14, ..., 484. That's 484/10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. So, 49 fours in units. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. For eights, units: 8,18,...,488. That's 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, eights total:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. But wait, let me check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89 fours in hundreds place. Similarly, for eights in the tens place, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, not 10. So, that's correct. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, I think that's right. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit):** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such occurrences (from 4 to 484).\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit):** The digit '4' appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit):** The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit):** The digit '8' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488), totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit):** The digit '8' appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488 (9 numbers). This gives 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit):** There are no page numbers with '8' in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of '8's from the total number of '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe digit '4' is printed 90 times more than the digit '8'.  \n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me double-check the counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for fours. Wait, when counting the tens place for fours, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. That seems correct. For eights in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set is only 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. That seems right. So, the difference is indeed 90. But wait, let me check the hundreds place again. For fours, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. That's correct. For eights, there are none in the hundreds place. So, yes, 188 fours and 98 eights. Therefore, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights. But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be 40, but maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the units place for fours. Let me recount the units place for fours. From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. That's correct. Similarly, for eights in units place, from 8 to 488, same calculation: 49 terms. So, that seems correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check: 400-488 inclusive. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct. So, total fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. Eights:49 (units)+49 (tens)=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, the answer should be 90. But wait, let me check if I counted the tens place correctly for fours. Each hundred block has 10 fours in the tens place. From 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Correct. For eights in the tens place, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, 4 blocks of 10 and one of 9, totaling 49. Correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.
