Therefore, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). \n   - The sequence starts at 4 and ends at 484.\n   - Number of terms: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 48.4 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Each number contributes one 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - The sequence starts at 8 and ends at 488.\n   - Number of terms: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block (480-488), which has 9 numbers.\n   - Total blocks: 5 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488).\n   - Total: (4 blocks \u00d7 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the fours and eights.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in the tens place for the eights. Let me check again. When counting the tens place for eights, I considered 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct.\n\nNow, for the fours in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, which is correct. Units place for fours: 4,14,...,484. Let's see, from 4 to 484, how many steps of 10? The formula is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for units place of eights: 8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers.\n\nWait, but when I added the fours, I got 188, and the eights as 98, so the difference is 90. But I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to miscount, especially in the higher digits. Let me try another approach: using digit positions for each number from 1 to 488.\n\nBut maybe that's too time-consuming. Alternatively, I can think of how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nWait, another way to count the number of 4's:\n\n- Units place: as above, 49\n- Tens place: as above, 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49+50+89=188\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal:98\n\nSo, 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but when I count the tens place for fours, I have 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets of 10, so 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but 488 is page 488, so the hundreds digit is 4, but the tens digit is 8. So, in the hundreds place, all numbers from 400-488 have a 4, which is 89 numbers.\n\nI think my counts are correct. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check: 188 fours and 98 eights, so 90 more fours. That seems correct.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to miscount, especially in the higher digits. Let me try another approach: using the formula for digit counting.\n\nFor each digit position, we can calculate how many times a digit appears.\n\nLet's start with the units place:\n\nFor the units digit, the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to n can be calculated as follows:\n\n- For each complete group of 10 numbers, the digit d appears once in the units place.\n- The number of complete groups is floor(n / 10).\n- Then, check the remainder: if the remainder is >= d, add 1 more.\n\nWait, but in our case, n=488, and d=4 and d=8.\n\nWait, actually, for the units digit, the count is floor((n + 1) / 10) if d !=0, but maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is:\n\n- Complete groups: floor(n / 10) times.\n- Then, check the remainder: if the remainder >= d, add 1.\n\nBut wait, for example, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 /10=48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing 1 four and 1 eight in the units place. Then, the remainder is 8, so for d=4, since 8 >=4, we add 1 more. So, units place for 4: 48 +1=49. Similarly, for 8: 48 +1=49. That's correct.\n\nNow, for the tens place:\n\nThe tens digit cycles every 100 numbers, with each 10-number block in the tens place. So, for each 100 numbers, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, for n=488, the number of complete hundreds is 4 (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), and then 480-488.\n\nWait, no, 488 is 4 hundreds, so 0-99 (100 numbers), 100-199 (another 100), 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nWait, so for the tens digit:\n\n- For each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n- Similarly, digit 8 appears 10 times per hundred.\n\nBut in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit goes up to 8 (as in 480-488). So, in the tens place, for 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but only up to 488, so that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, for the tens place:\n\n- For digit 4: in each complete hundred, 10 times. There are 4 complete hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), so 4*10=40.\n- Then, in the last partial hundred (400-488), does the tens digit have a 4? Let's see: 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so another 10 fours in the tens place.\n- So total for 4 in tens place: 40 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8 in the tens place:\n\n- In each complete hundred, 10 times: 4*10=40.\n- In the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page).\n- So, 40 +9=49.\n\nSo, that confirms our earlier counts: 50 fours and 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place:\n\n- Digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (as 488 -400 +1=89).\n- Digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so no page numbers from 800-899.\n\nSo, total fours in hundreds place:89, eights:0.\n\nAdding up:\n\n- Fours: units(49) + tens(50) + hundreds(89)=188\n- Eights: units(49) + tens(49) + hundreds(0)=98\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488 (9 numbers). Total: 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - More '4's than '8's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.  \n\\boxed{90}"

So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Let me check that again. The hundreds place is 4 from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct. For the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. That's 49 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place is 8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers.

Wait, but I think I might have an error in the units place for eights. Let me check: from 8 to 488, how many numbers with 8 in units place? The first is 8, then 18, 28,...,488. So, how many terms? The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 +10(n-1) = 488. So, 10(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 terms. That's correct. Similarly, for the tens place, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 5 sets with 10,10,10,10,9. That's 49. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, the difference is 188-98=90.

    "text": " Let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Counting 4's: units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many terms? Let's see, 484 is 4*121, so 121 terms, but wait, that can't be right because 484 is the 49th term. Wait, no, because 4,14,...,484 is every 10 numbers starting at 4, so the number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So units:49 fours. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each 10 numbers, so 50 fours. Hundreds place:400-488:89 numbers, so 89 fours. Total fours:49+50+89=188. That seems correct. Now, 8's: units place:8,18,...,488. How many terms? (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights. Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. Hundreds place:0. So total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me check if I counted correctly for the hundreds place in the tens digit for 8's. From 480-488, that's 9 numbers:480,481,...,488. So yes, 9 numbers.
