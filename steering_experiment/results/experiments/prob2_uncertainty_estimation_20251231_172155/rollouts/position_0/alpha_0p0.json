    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should understand the problem clearly. Each page from 1 to 488 is printed once, and I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nAlright, so I need to calculate the number of times 4 appears in each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately and then do the same for 8. After that, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to get the answer.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in a sequence of numbers. Since we're dealing with page numbers from 1 to 488, I should figure out how many complete groups of 10 there are and then see how many extra numbers are left beyond that.\n\nThe total number of pages is 488. Dividing 488 by 10 gives me 48 complete groups of 10, with a remainder of 8. So, in each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears once. Therefore, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48, and the number of 8's is also 48.\n\nWait, but I have 8 extra pages beyond the 480th page. Pages 481 to 488. In the units place of these, the digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these extra 8 numbers, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). Therefore, the total for the units place is 48 + 1 = 49 for 4's and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8's. Hmm, that means in the units place, both digits appear 49 times. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. Again, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in the tens place, but this time in groups of 100. Let me think. For every 100 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 488 pages, how many complete hundreds do we have?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49, 140-149, etc.), and the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for each of the 4 hundreds, that's 4 times 10 = 40 for 4's and 40 for 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, looking at the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 and then starts again. Wait, actually, from 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-488). So, let's see how many times each digit appears in the tens place here.\n\nEach tens digit from 0 to 8 appears exactly 10 times, except for the last one which is 8, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 appears from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but 480 is included in the 401-488 range? Wait, no, 480 is page 480, which is part of 401-488. Wait, actually, 480 is page 480, so from 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 times)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10 times)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10 times)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10 times)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 times)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10 times)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10 times)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10 times)\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 times)\n\nWait, so in the tens place, from 401-488, the digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and the digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, in the tens place, for the incomplete hundred, 4's appear 10 times and 8's appear 8 times.\n\nTherefore, adding that to the complete hundreds, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 4*10 + 10 = 50, and the total number of 8's is 4*10 + 8 = 48.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Each complete hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 40 each. Then, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), 4's appear 10 times and 8's appear 8 times. So total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's: 40 + 8 = 48. So, the difference in tens place is 50 - 48 = 2 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the units place had the same number of 4's and 8's, so the difference would be from the tens and hundreds places. Let me check the hundreds place now.\n\nIn the hundreds place, each page number from 1 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. That's 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nThe digit 8, on the other hand, never appears in the hundreds place because the highest page is 488, which is in the 400s. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. Therefore, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89, and 8's: 0. So, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's than 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the differences from each digit place.\n\nUnits place: 49 - 49 = 0\nTens place: 50 - 48 = 2\nHundreds place: 89 - 0 = 89\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 2 + 89 = 91\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, right? Because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nAnd for the 8's, since the hundreds digit never reaches 8, it's 0.\n\nSo, adding up the differences:\n\nUnits: 0\nTens: 2\nHundreds: 89\nTotal: 91\n\nTherefore, there are 91 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each digit place again to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nTotal pages: 488\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears in the units place every 10 pages. So, 488 / 10 = 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 and one 8. So, 48*1 = 48 for each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, total 4's in units: 48 + 1 = 49, 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, difference is 0. That's correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach 100 pages, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) contribute 4*10 = 40 each for 4's and 8's. Then, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Each digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times (since 481-488 is 8 numbers). Wait, no, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens 0 (10 numbers)\n- 411-420: tens 1 (10)\n- 421-430: tens 2 (10)\n- 431-440: tens 3 (10)\n- 441-450: tens 4 (10)\n- 451-460: tens 5 (10)\n- 461-470: tens 6 (10)\n- 471-480: tens 7 (10)\n- 481-488: tens 8 (8 numbers)\n\nSo, in the tens place, from 401-488, digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, total 4's in tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 = 50. 8's: 40 + 8 = 48. So, difference is 2. That's correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's.\n100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's.\n200-299: hundreds digit is 2, same.\n300-399: hundreds digit is 3.\n400-488: hundreds digit is 4. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 89 4's in hundreds place.\n8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: units (49) + tens (48) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So, the calculation seems consistent.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place (from 1 to 480).\n   - Pages 481-488 add one more 4 and one more 8.\n   - Total 4's: 49, Total 8's: 49. Difference: 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place for the first 400 pages.\n   - Pages 401-488 add 10 more 4's and 8 more 8's.\n   - Total 4's: 50, Total 8's: 48. Difference: 2.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 1-399 have no 4's or 8's in the hundreds place.\n   - Pages 400-488 contribute 89 4's and no 8's.\n   - Total 4's: 89, Total 8's: 0. Difference: 89.\n\nSumming the differences:\n- Units: 0\n- Tens: 2\n- Hundreds: 89\n- Total: 0 + 2 + 89 = 91\n\n**Answer:** There are 91 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should consider all the page numbers from 1 to 488. Each page number is printed once, so I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the digits in the units place and then the tens place, and finally the hundreds place. I'll handle each place separately because the way digits repeat can vary depending on the place.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, for example, from 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. Here, the digit 4 appears once (at 4) and the digit 8 appears once (at 8). This pattern repeats every ten numbers.\n\nNow, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each complete set of ten, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 times 1, which is 48. Similarly, the number of 8's is also 48 in the units place.\n\nBut wait, I also have those extra 8 numbers (481-488). Let me check the units digits in these. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in this extra set, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). So, adding these, the total 4's in the units place become 48 + 1 = 49, and the 8's become 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so maybe I should check that again.\n\nWait, actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so the extra numbers are 481 to 488. The units digits in this range are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, yes, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So, the total units place counts are 49 for 4's and 49 for 8's.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because 488 is the last page, so the last page is 488, which is included in the 481-488 range. So, the units digits in this range are indeed 1 through 8, so 4 and 8 each appear once. So, units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place over 100 numbers. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, it appears 10 times in each 100-number block (e.g., 40-49). Similarly, 8 appears 10 times in each 100-number block (e.g., 80-89).\n\nNow, how many complete 100-number blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an additional 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each of these 4 complete blocks, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the digit 8 appears 10 times as well. So, for the tens place, the counts so far are 4*10 = 40 for 4's and 4*10 = 40 for 8's.\n\nNow, let's check the additional 88 pages: 401-488. The tens digit in this range goes from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 480-488). So, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nFrom 401-410: tens digit is 0.\n411-420: tens digit is 1.\n421-430: tens digit is 2.\n431-440: tens digit is 3.\n441-450: tens digit is 4.\n451-460: tens digit is 5.\n461-470: tens digit is 6.\n471-480: tens digit is 7.\n481-488: tens digit is 8.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 481-488 is only 8 numbers, so the tens digit here is 8 for 481-488, but only from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 480-488? Wait, no, 480 would be the end of 471-480. Wait, actually, 480 is included in 471-480, so 481 starts the next set. So, 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 481-488, but only 8 numbers, so the digit 8 appears once in the tens place here.\n\nWait, no, in the tens place, each set of 10 numbers has the same tens digit. So, 481-490 would have tens digit 8, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 for all these 8 numbers, so the digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place for 481-488. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because in the tens place, each digit is the same for a block of 10 numbers. So, from 480-489, the tens digit is 8, but since we're only going up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488), but 480 is part of the previous block (471-480). So, in 481-488, the tens digit is 8, but that's only 8 numbers. Wait, no, 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for each of those 8 numbers, so the digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place here.\n\nWait, but that seems off because in the tens place, each digit is the same for 10 numbers, but if we have only 8 numbers, does the digit 8 appear 8 times or just once? Hmm, actually, no. The tens digit is determined by the second digit from the right. So, for example, in 481, the tens digit is 8, and it remains 8 until 489. But since we're stopping at 488, the tens digit is 8 for 481-488, which is 8 numbers. Therefore, the digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place in this range.\n\nWait, but that seems high because in a full 10-number block, the tens digit is the same for all 10, so if we have 8 numbers, the digit 8 would appear 8 times in the tens place. Similarly, for the digit 4, in the tens place, let's see where it appears in 401-488.\n\nLooking at 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in the block 441-450. So, from 441 to 450, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 450 is included in 401-488, so that's 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, in this additional 88 pages, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 441-450 is within 401-488, so yes, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times here. And for the digit 8, as we saw, in 481-488, the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times and the digit 8 appears 8 times in the additional 88 pages.\n\nSo, adding that to our previous counts: for the tens place, the digit 4 appears 4*10 (from the complete blocks) + 10 (from the additional 88 pages) = 50 times. The digit 8 appears 4*10 (from the complete blocks) + 8 (from the additional 88 pages) = 48 times.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, in the tens place, 4's: 50, 8's: 48.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is a bit different because it changes less frequently. From 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0 (since these are two-digit numbers). From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1. From 200-299, it's 2, and so on.\n\nIn our case, the book has 488 pages, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4. Let's break it down:\n\n- Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0. So, neither 4 nor 8 appears in the hundreds place here.\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1. So, no 4 or 8 in the hundreds place.\n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2. Again, no 4 or 8.\n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3. Still no 4 or 8.\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4. So, here, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Since the highest page is 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. The hundreds digits go up to 4, so the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, the count for 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nWait, but let me double-check these calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n- From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Every 10 pages, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens and 8 extra. In each full ten, 4 appears once, so 48 times. In the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (at 484). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n- From 1-488, each 100 pages have 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so 4*10 = 40.\n- In the additional 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 441-450 (10 numbers) and 8 in 481-488 (8 numbers). So, 10 + 8 = 18. Wait, no, that's incorrect because in the tens place, we're adding to the previous counts. Wait, actually, in the additional 88 pages, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 times, and the tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 times. So, adding to the previous 40, 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's in tens place: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 times.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the tens place, in the additional 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times. So, in the tens place, 4's: 40 + 10 = 50, 8's: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nUnits place: 49 each.\n\nHundreds place: 4's: 89, 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a more systematic way to calculate this, perhaps using a formula or a different approach?\n\nAnother way is to consider each digit place separately and calculate the number of times each digit appears.\n\nFor the units place:\n- The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is given by floor((N + 1) / 10) + (if the last digit is >= d, add 1, else 0).\n\nWait, actually, it's more precise to say that for each digit d, the count is (N // 10) * 1 + (1 if (N % 10) >= d else 0). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think.\n\nWait, for the units digit, the count of digit d from 1 to N is equal to the number of complete groups of 10, which is N // 10, plus 1 if the remaining digits (N % 10) are >= d. But since we're starting from 1, not 0, we have to adjust.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of it as:\n\nFor units digit d, the count is:\ncount_units = (N // 10) + (1 if (N % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nBut since we're starting from 1, not 0, we have to adjust because 0 isn't included. So, for example, for d=4, from 1-488, the count would be (488 // 10) + (1 if (488 % 10) >= 4 else 0) = 48 + 1 = 49, which matches our earlier count.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8, it's 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nFor the tens place, the formula is a bit more involved. The count of digit d in the tens place from 1 to N is:\n\ncount_tens = (N // 100) * 10 + extra\n\nWhere extra depends on the last two digits.\n\nIf the last two digits are >= d*10, then extra = 10; else, if the last two digits are >= d*10 + 1, then extra = (N % 100) - (d*10) + 1; else, extra = 0.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to break it down:\n\nFor the tens digit d, the count is:\nhigh = N // 100\nlow = N % 100\n\ncount_tens = high * 10\n\nif low >= d*10 + 10:\n    count_tens += 10\nelif low >= d*10:\n    count_tens += low - (d*10) + 1\nelse:\n    count_tens += 0\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.\n\nFor the tens digit, each digit d appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers. For example, d=4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n\nSo, the number of complete hundreds is high = N // 100.\n\nEach complete hundred contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n\nSo, count_tens = high * 10\n\nThen, we look at the remaining part, which is the last partial hundred: from high*100 + 1 to N.\n\nIn this partial hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, if the last two digits (low) are >= d*10 + 1, then the number of times d appears in the tens place in this partial hundred is (low - (d*10) + 1). If low < d*10, then it's 0.\n\nWait, let me test this with d=4 and N=488.\n\nhigh = 488 // 100 = 4\nlow = 488 % 100 = 88\n\ncount_tens = 4 * 10 = 40\n\nNow, check if low >= 4*10 + 1: 88 >= 41? Yes.\n\nSo, count_tens += (88 - 40 + 1) = 49\n\nWait, but that would give 40 + 49 = 89, which can't be right because in the tens place, d=4 appears 10 times in the 400-488 range (440-449), which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nWait, perhaps my formula is incorrect.\n\nWait, let me think differently. For the tens digit, the count is:\n\nFor each hundred block, the digit d appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n\nNow, for the last partial hundred, if the tens digit is >= d, then we add the number of times d appears in the tens place in that partial block.\n\nWait, in our case, N=488, so the last partial hundred is 401-488.\n\nIn this range, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488).\n\nSo, for d=4, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nFor d=8, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, 480 is included in the previous hundred (401-488). Wait, no, 401-488 includes 480, which is part of 480-488. So, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 8 times, but that was a mistake. It's actually 9 times because 480 is included.\n\nWait, but 480 is page 480, which is within 401-488, so the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the last partial hundred.\n\nSo, using this approach:\n\nFor d=4, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times.\n\nFor d=8, it appears in 480-488, which is 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place counts:\n\nFor 4: 4*10 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from last partial hundred) = 50\n\nFor 8: 4*10 (from complete hundreds) + 9 (from last partial hundred) = 49\n\nWait, but earlier I had 48 for 8's in the tens place. Hmm, so which is correct?\n\nWait, let me recount. From 1-400, the tens digit 8 appears 4*10 = 40 times. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's, from 1-400, it's 4*10 = 40. From 401-488, it's 10 times (440-449). So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for units place, as before, 4's:49, 8's:49.\n\nHundreds place: 4's:89, 8's:0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nWait, but earlier I had 48 for tens place 8's, but now it's 49. So, where did I go wrong earlier?\n\nWait, in the initial calculation, I thought that in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers. But actually, it's from 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 480 is included. So, the correct count is 9, not 8. Therefore, the total 8's in the tens place should be 40 + 9 = 49, not 48.\n\nSo, that changes the total counts:\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 91, but now it's 90. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let's recast the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place. From 400-488, how many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nFor the 8's in the hundreds place, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, but earlier I had 97 for 8's, but that was due to a miscalculation in the tens place. So, the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me confirm again.\n\nWait, in the tens place, for 8's, from 1-400, it's 4*10=40. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 times. So, total 8's in tens place:40+9=49.\n\nSimilarly, units place:49 each.\n\nSo, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\n4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the difference was 91, but now it's 90. Let me check the counts again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units place. Let me recount the units place.\n\nFrom 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nWe can calculate it as follows:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10:488 //10=48. Each group contributes 1 occurrence of 4 in the units place, so 48 times.\n\nThen, the remaining pages:488 %10=8. So, the last partial group is 481-488. The units digits here are 1-8, so 4 appears once (at 484).\n\nSo, total units place 4's:48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, units place 8's:48+1=49.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nFrom 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, total 4's in tens place:40+10=50.\n\nSimilarly, from 1-400, 8's in tens place:4*10=40.\n\nFrom 401-488, tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, total 8's in tens place:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's:89, 8's:0.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 91, but that was due to an error in counting the tens place for 8's as 8 instead of 9. So, the correct difference is 90.\n\nI think that's the accurate count now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting '4's and '8's in Each Digit Place:**\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - For each set of 10 consecutive numbers, both '4' and '8' appear once in the units place.\n     - There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 each.\n     - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) contribute one more '4' and one more '8'.\n     - Total '4's in units place: 49.\n     - Total '8's in units place: 49.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - Each 100-number block contributes 10 '4's and 10 '8's in the tens place.\n     - There are 4 complete blocks (1-400), contributing 40 each.\n     - From 401-488, '4' appears in 440-449 (10 times), and '8' appears in 480-488 (9 times).\n     - Total '4's in tens place: 50.\n     - Total '8's in tens place: 49.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - '4' appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 times.\n     - '8' never appears in the hundreds place in this range.\n     - Total '4's in hundreds place: 89.\n     - Total '8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\n2. **Summing Up the Counts:**\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Difference = Total '4's - Total '8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe digit '4' is printed 90 times more than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, let's see. I think the best way to approach this is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nFirst, I should probably break down the problem by looking at each digit place separately\u2014units, tens, and hundreds. That way, I can systematically count the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each place. Let me start by considering each place one by one.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once, and the same goes for the digit 8. For example, from 1 to 10, the 4 appears in 4, and the 8 appears in 8. So, if I can figure out how many complete sets of ten there are in 488 pages, I can calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in the units place.\n\nBut wait, 488 isn't a multiple of ten. The last set will have only 8 numbers. So, I need to handle that separately. Let me calculate how many complete sets of ten there are in 488. Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete sets of ten and then an additional 8 numbers.\n\nIn each complete set of ten, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so each digit from 0 to 9 appears once. Therefore, in the units place, each digit appears 48 times. But wait, that's not entirely accurate because the last partial set of 8 numbers (from 481 to 488) will only have the units digits from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, the digits 1-8 appear once, and 9 and 0 don't appear in this last partial set.\n\nSo, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 times (once per each complete set of ten) plus whether 4 appears in the last partial set. But in the last partial set, the units digits go up to 8, so 4 does appear once (in 484). Similarly, the number of 8's in the units place is 48 times plus once in the last partial set (488). Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that seems like both digits 4 and 8 appear the same number of times in the units place. Hmm, but I thought maybe the 4 would have an extra occurrence because the last partial set includes 484, but the 8 also gets an extra in 488. So, yes, both have 49 occurrences in the units place. So, the difference in the units place is zero. Interesting.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit changes every ten numbers. So, for example, from 1-10, the tens digit is 0 or 1. Wait, actually, from 1-9, the tens digit is 0, and from 10-19, it's 1, and so on. So, each digit from 0 to 9 appears in the tens place for exactly 10 consecutive numbers. But again, since our book ends at 488, the last set might be incomplete.\n\nLet me figure out how many complete sets of hundred there are. Wait, maybe it's better to consider the tens place separately. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit in the tens place appears 10 times per hundred.\n\nBut our book has 488 pages, so let's see how many hundreds that is. 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, there are four complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an additional 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. So, for the digit 4, that's 10 occurrences per hundred, and same for 8. Since there are four complete hundreds, the number of 4's in the tens place is 4 * 10 = 40, and same for 8's: 40.\n\nNow, let's look at the partial set from 401-488. The tens digit in this range goes from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So, the tens digits here are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Each of these digits appears 10 times except for the last one, which only appears 8 times (since 481-488 is 8 numbers). So, for the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for 8, which appears 8 times.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. From 401-410, the tens digit is 0 (10 times). From 411-420, it's 1 (10 times). Similarly, up to 471-480, the tens digit is 7 (10 times). Then, from 481-490, the tens digit is 8, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times here.\n\nTherefore, in the partial set from 401-488, the digit 4 in the tens place appears 10 times (from 441-450), and the digit 8 in the tens place appears 8 times (from 481-488).\n\nSo, adding that to the four complete hundreds, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 40 (from the four hundreds) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50. Similarly, the number of 8's in the tens place is 40 (from the four hundreds) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. In each complete hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place, so 4 appears 10 times per hundred, and there are four hundreds, so 4*10=40. Then, in the partial hundred, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more 4's. So, total 40+10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place: in each complete hundred, 8 occurs 10 times in the tens place (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4*10=40. Then, in the partial hundred, 8 occurs in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 more 8's. So, total 40+8=48.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 48 times. So, the difference here is 50 - 48 = 2 more 4's than 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit changes every 100 numbers. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0. From 100-199, it's 1, from 200-299, it's 2, and so on. Since our book goes up to 488, the hundreds digits are 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nIn each hundred, the hundreds digit is the same for all 100 numbers. So, for example, from 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1 for all 100 numbers. Similarly, from 200-299, it's 2, etc.\n\nNow, let's count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place.\n\nFirst, 4 appears in the hundreds place for the entire range 400-499. But our book only goes up to 488, so it's from 400-488. That's 89 numbers. Wait, no, actually, from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit cycles through 0,1,2,3,4. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all because the highest hundreds digit is 4 (for 400-488). So, the digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place in any page number.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's than 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, each of those 89 page numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. Since 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place anywhere in the book, that's correct.\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each digit place.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\n- 4's: 49\n- 8's: 49\n\nDifference in units place: 49 - 49 = 0\n\nTens place:\n\n- 4's: 50\n- 8's: 48\n\nDifference in tens place: 50 - 48 = 2\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nDifference in hundreds place: 89 - 0 = 89\n\nNow, adding up the differences:\n\nUnits: 0\n\nTens: +2\n\nHundreds: +89\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 2 + 89 = 91\n\nSo, the total number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n- Each complete set of ten (48 sets) gives 1 occurrence of 4 and 1 of 8. So, 48 each.\n\n- Then, the last partial set (481-488) has 484 and 488, so one 4 and one 8. So, total 49 each. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each complete hundred (four of them) gives 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place. So, 40 each.\n\n- Then, in the partial hundred (401-488), 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, 40 +10=50 for 4's, and 40 +8=48 for 8's. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488). 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 -97=91\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each set of 10 numbers contains one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10, contributing 48 each.\n   - The last 8 numbers (481-488) add one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488).\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Difference: 0\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each complete hundred (4 sets) contributes 10 4's and 10 8's.\n   - Total from complete sets: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 each.\n   - The partial set (401-488) adds 10 4's (441-450) and 8 8's (481-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 8 = 48\n   - Difference: 50 - 48 = 2\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488 (89 numbers).\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n   - Difference: 89 - 0 = 89\n\n**Total Difference:**\n- Units: 0\n- Tens: +2\n- Hundreds: +89\n- Combined: 0 + 2 + 89 = 91\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 91.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that each page is numbered from 1 to 488. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me break it down by the positions of the digits: units place, tens place, hundreds place. I'll handle each position separately for both digits.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears once every 10 pages. So in 488 pages, how many times does it appear in the units place? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, it's 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4. But wait, actually, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 pages, so the number of 4's in the units place is the integer part of 488 divided by 10, which is 48. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit cycles up to 8, so the 48th group ends at 480, and then 481 to 488 are the remaining 8 pages. So yes, 48 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive pages every 100 pages. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, etc. So how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds. In each hundred, the 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (from 40-49). So that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. But wait, in the last partial hundred, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for pages 440-449, which is 10 pages. So that's another 10, making it 40 + 10 = 50 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 only starting at 400. So the tens digit being 4 occurs in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 times 10 pages each, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So 5 times 10 is 50. So 50 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4 full hundreds, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 starting at 400, so the tens digit being 4 occurs in each hundred block, including the 400s. So yes, 5 times 10, so 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488. How many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So 187 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nWait, wait, that can't be right. Let me check again. Because when I'm calculating the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each having a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. In the tens place, as I thought, 5 times 10, which is 50. Units place, 48 times. So 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Hmm, that seems high, but let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, in the units place, from 1 to 488, every 10 pages, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so 4 appears once every 10 pages. So 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. Then, in the tens place, every 100 pages, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages. So in 488 pages, how many hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. In each of these 4 full hundreds, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for pages 440-449, which is another 10 pages. So total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50. And hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89. So total 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears once every 10 pages. So similar to 4, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 times. But wait, in the last partial group, from 481-488, the units digit goes up to 8, so page 488 has an 8 in the units place. So actually, it's 48 times. Wait, no, 488 is included, so 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, and the last partial cycle includes 8, so total 49 times? Wait, no, because from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (1-480), each contributing one 8, and then from 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so 488 has an 8, which is the 49th occurrence. So units place: 49 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 1-10, units digit 8 is at 8. 11-20: 18. 21-30:28. ... 471-480:478. Then 481-488:488. So that's 48 times up to 478, and then 488 is the 49th. So yes, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive pages every 100 pages. So from 80-89, 180-189, etc. How many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 full hundreds. In each, the tens digit is 8 for 10 pages, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-489, but 488 is the last page, so that's pages 480-488, which is 9 pages, but wait, 480-489 would be 10 pages, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 pages. So in the tens place, how many 8's are there? From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total tens place 8's: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40, plus the last partial hundred contributing 9, making it 49. So tens place: 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place from page 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nNow, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 times.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So 4's appear 187 times, and 8's appear 98 times. So the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big difference.\n\nWait, for the units place of 4: 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 times, but wait, from 1-480, that's 48 times, and then 488 has a 4 in the units place as well? No, 488 is 4-8-8, so units digit is 8, not 4. So units digit 4's are 48 times, not 49.\n\nWait, earlier I thought units digit 4's are 48 times, but in the 8's case, it's 49 times because 488 ends with 8. So for 4's, units place: 48 times.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place of 4's: 50 times, as calculated earlier.\n\nHundreds place: 89 times.\n\nSo total 4's: 48 +50 +89 = 187.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49 times (since 488 is included).\n\nTens place: 49 times (as calculated).\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 +49 = 98.\n\nSo difference: 187 -98 =89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I thought about the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as 9 pages, but actually, 480-489 would be 10 pages, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 9 pages. So that's correct, 9 pages with 8 in the tens place in the last partial hundred.\n\nSo, yes, 49 times for 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the 4's in the tens place. From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\n- 40-49:10\n- 140-149:10\n- 240-249:10\n- 340-349:10\n- 440-449:10\n\nSo that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place:\n\n- 80-89:10\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nTotal: 4*10 +9=49.\n\nUnits place for 8's: 49 times because 488 is included.\n\nSo, yes, 8's total 98, 4's total 187, difference is 89.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's in the hundreds place were 89, which is correct because 400-488 is 89 pages.\n\nSo, final answer: 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm with another approach.\n\nAnother way to calculate the number of times a digit appears is to consider each digit place separately and calculate how many times each digit appears in that place.\n\nFor the units place:\n\n- For any digit d (other than 0), the number of times it appears in the units place from 1 to N is floor(N/10) + (1 if the units digit of N is >=d else 0). Wait, no, more accurately, it's the number of complete groups of 10, which is floor(N/10), plus 1 if the units digit of N is >=d.\n\nWait, let's test this with N=488.\n\nFor digit 4 in units place:\n\nfloor(488/10) =48, and since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so 48 +1=49? But earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, this seems conflicting.\n\nWait, no, wait, the formula is: number of times digit d appears in units place from 1 to N is floor(N/10) + (1 if (N mod 10) >=d else 0). But wait, actually, no, that's not quite right. Because in each group of 10, the digit d appears exactly once in the units place. So from 1 to N, it's floor(N/10) times, plus 1 if the units digit of N is >=d. Wait, but if N mod 10 >=d, then the digit d has appeared once more in the units place beyond the floor(N/10) groups.\n\nWait, let's test with N=10. For d=4, units place: 4 appears once (at 4). floor(10/10)=1, and 10 mod10=0, which is <4, so total 1 time, which is correct.\n\nFor N=14, d=4: floor(14/10)=1, 14 mod10=4, which is >=4, so total 1+1=2 times (at 4 and 14). Correct.\n\nFor N=488, d=4: floor(488/10)=48, 488 mod10=8 >=4, so total 48+1=49 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 48 times. So which is correct?\n\nWait, in the problem, the pages are from 1 to 488, inclusive. So page 488 has units digit 8, so the digit 4 in the units place occurs at 4,14,24,...,474,484. So how many times is that?\n\nFrom 4 to 484, stepping by 10: (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49 times. So yes, 49 times. So earlier I was wrong; it's 49 times, not 48.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that 488 is the last page, so the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included, but 484 is the last page with 4 in the units place. So from 4 to 484, that's 49 times.\n\nWait, so I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought it was 48 times. So units place for 4's is 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, it's floor(488/10)=48, plus 1 because 488 mod10=8 >=8, so 48+1=49 times.\n\nSo, units place for 4's:49, 8's:49.\n\nNow, tens place:\n\nFor digit d in the tens place, the number of times it appears from 1 to N is calculated as:\n\nFor each hundred, the digit d appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers. So for N=488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nIt's the number of times the tens digit is 4, which occurs in the ranges 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, except possibly the last one if N is less than the end of the range.\n\nSince N=488, the last range is 440-449, which is fully within 488, so all 5 ranges are complete, each contributing 10 numbers. So total 5*10=50 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, the ranges are 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-489. But since N=488, the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So total for 8's in the tens place: 4*10 +9=49 times.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nFor 4's, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nFor 8's, the hundreds digit is 8 from 800-899, but since N=488, there are 0 times.\n\nSo total counts:\n\n4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) =49+50=99+89=188.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 49+50+89=188, but earlier I had 48+50+89=187. So which is correct?\n\nWait, using the correct units place count for 4's as 49, so total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nSimilarly, 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98.\n\nSo the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, now I'm confused because earlier I thought 4's were 187, but now it's 188. Which is correct?\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nUnits place for 4's:49\n\nTens place for 4's:50\n\nHundreds place for 4's:89\n\nTotal:49+50=99, plus89=188.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nUnits place for 8's:49\n\nTens place for 8's:49\n\nHundreds place for 8's:0\n\nTotal:98.\n\nSo difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 187, but that was because I mistakenly counted units place as 48 instead of 49. So the correct count is 188 for 4's and 98 for 8's, difference 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nIt's every 10 pages:4,14,24,...,474,484. So how many terms in this sequence?\n\nThe first term is 4, the last term is 484. The common difference is 10.\n\nNumber of terms: ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So yes, 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place:8,18,28,...,488. Last term is 488.\n\nNumber of terms: ((488 -8)/10)+1=(480/10)+1=48+1=49. So 49 times.\n\nSo units place:4's=49,8's=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4's:50 times.\n\nFor 8's:49 times.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's:89 times.\n\n8's:0.\n\nSo total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo the correct answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 89. So I must have made a mistake in the initial count.\n\nWait, let me recount everything carefully.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 4's:49\n- 8's:49\n\nTens place:\n\n- 4's:50\n- 8's:49\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's:89\n- 8's:0\n\nTotal:\n\n4's:49+50+89=188\n\n8's:49+49=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, so the initial mistake was in the units place count for 4's, which is 49, not 48. So the correct difference is 90.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure that the hundreds place for 4's is indeed 89.\n\nFrom page 400 to page 488, inclusive, that's 488-400+1=89 pages. Each of these pages has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct.\n\nSo, yes, 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's is 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal number of 8's is 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 89, but that was because I mistakenly counted units place for 4's as 48 instead of 49. So now, after correcting that, it's 90.\n\nWait, but let me just think again about the tens place for 8's. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place:5*10=50. Correct.\n\nSo yes, the correct difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 pages. From 1 to 488, this happens 49 times (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, and the 49th occurrence is at page 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive pages in each hundred (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 5 such groups (including 440-449), contributing 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 pages. From 1 to 488, this happens 49 times (including page 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive pages in each hundred (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are 5 such groups, but the last group (480-488) has only 9 pages, contributing 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488. Then, I'll do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense.\n\nLet me start by considering the structure of page numbers. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 up to 488. So, I should analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both 4 and 8.\n\nI remember that when counting digits in numbers, it's helpful to look at each position (units, tens, hundreds) separately and calculate how often each digit appears in each position. So, I'll need to consider each digit place for both 4 and 8.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4. I'll check how many times 4 appears in the units place, then in the tens place, and finally in the hundreds place.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, how many such sets are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of ten, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each full set, 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. From 1 to 480, there are 480 numbers, which is 48 sets of ten. Each set contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, that's 8 numbers, and the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more. So, yes, 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNext, the tens place for 4. In the tens place, 4 appears in blocks of 100. For example, in 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all ten numbers. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Well, from 1-488, we have four full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, actually, each hundred block has a 40-49 block. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. How many hundreds are there?\n\nFrom 1-488, we have four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred (401-488). So, in each full hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 times 10 is 40. Now, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490. Wait, but our range stops at 488, so the tens digits go up to 8 in 481-488. So, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's are 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 (from partial hundred) = 50.\n\nWait, let me make sure. From 1-400, each hundred has a 40-49 block, so 10 per hundred, times 4 hundreds, which is 40. Then, from 401-488, the 40-49 block would be 440-449, which is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, total 50. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place for 4. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 times.\n\nWait, but actually, each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's correct. So, 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Okay.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place for 8. Similar to 4, in every set of ten numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full tens are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, the last partial set is 481-488, which includes 8 in the units place (488). So, that's one more. So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me think. From 1-480, there are 480 numbers, which is 48 sets of ten. Each set has one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more. So, total 49. That seems correct.\n\nNext, the tens place for 8. In the tens place, 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks are there up to 488?\n\nFrom 1-488, we have four full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. So, in each full hundred, the tens digit 8 appears in 80-89, which is 10 numbers. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 times.\n\nNow, in the partial hundred 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but our range stops at 488. So, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481,...,488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8, so the units digits go from 0 to 8. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 times. So, total tens place 8's are 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Each full hundred contributes 10, so 4 hundreds give 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place for 8. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, so 4's appear 188 times, and 8's appear 98 times. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But let me check again, especially the tens place for 8.\n\nWait, in the tens place for 8, I had 4 full hundreds contributing 10 each, so 40, and then 480-488 contributing 9. So, 49. That seems right.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place for 4, I had 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again for 4. From 1-488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, the last partial set from 481-488, which has 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. Wait, no, 481-488 is 8 numbers: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once in 484. So, that's one more, making units place 4's 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, same logic applies. So, 49.\n\nWait, but let me think about the tens place for 4 again. From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, that's five blocks, each contributing 10 4's. Wait, but earlier I thought it was four blocks. Wait, 40-49 is in the first hundred, 140-149 in the second, 240-249 in the third, 340-349 in the fourth, and 440-449 in the fifth (partial hundred). So, that's five blocks, each with 10 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier I considered only four full hundreds, so 4 blocks, each with 10, totaling 40, and then the fifth block in the partial hundred (440-449) adding another 10, making it 50. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but 488 is less than 500, so the fifth block is only up to 449, which is within 401-488. So, yes, that's 10 more, making it 50.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's five blocks, each contributing 10, but the last block only has 9 numbers (480-488). So, 4 blocks with 10 each, and one with 9, totaling 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was four full hundreds contributing 10 each, and then the fifth block contributing 9, totaling 49. That's correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98. So, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I missed anything. For example, in the hundreds place for 4, I considered 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. That's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about 488. The last page is 488, so the hundreds digit is 4, so that's included in the 89.\n\nWait, 400-488 is 89 numbers because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place in 4, I had 50, which comes from 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place.\n   - Total sets of 10 up to 480: 48 sets \u2192 48 fours.\n   - Last partial set (481-488): 484 contributes one 4.\n   - Total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each hundred block (e.g., 40-49) contributes 10 fours.\n   - Four full hundreds (1-400) \u2192 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 fours.\n   - Partial hundred (401-488) includes 440-449 \u2192 10 fours.\n   - Total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 8 in the units place.\n   - Total sets of 10 up to 480: 48 sets \u2192 48 eights.\n   - Last partial set (481-488): 488 contributes one 8.\n   - Total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each hundred block (e.g., 80-89) contributes 10 eights.\n   - Four full hundreds (1-400) \u2192 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights.\n   - Partial hundred (401-488) includes 480-488 \u2192 9 eights.\n   - Total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** 90 more 4's are printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should consider each digit place separately: the units place and the tens place. Because a page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number, but since 488 is a three-digit number, I'll need to check all three places up to the hundreds place.\n\nLet me start by calculating how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor the units digit, the numbers cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, in each set of 10 consecutive pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for the digit 8. But I need to check how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488 pages and then see if there's any remainder.\n\nSo, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. That means there are 48 complete sets of 10 pages, and then 8 extra pages. In each complete set, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for the units digit, 4 appears 48 times, and 8 also appears 48 times. But I need to check the last 8 pages, which are from 481 to 488. In these, the units digits are 1 through 8. So, in the units place, does 4 appear in these last 8 pages? Yes, page 484. So that adds one more 4. Similarly, does 8 appear? Yes, page 488. So that adds one more 8. Therefore, in the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, they're equal in the units place.\n\nWait, that can't be right because I thought maybe 4 would appear more, but maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me double-check. Each complete set of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 complete sets give 48 each. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8. So, 4 is present once (484) and 8 is present once (488). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, same in units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, the digits cycle every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 pages. So, for example, from 0-99, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 times, and similarly for 8 in 80-89, also 10 times.\n\nSo, first, how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49 in each hundred), and the same for 8 (e.g., 80-89). So, 4 times 10 is 40 for 4's, and same for 8's.\n\nNow, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place in this range.\n\nFrom 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So, for the tens digit:\n\n- The digit 4 appears in the tens place in 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So that's 10 pages where the tens digit is 4. So, that's 10 more 4's in the tens place.\n\n- The digit 8 appears in the tens place in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488. That's 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. From 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit, how many times does it occur?\n\nFor tens digit 4: pages 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, 10 times.\n\nFor tens digit 8: pages 480-488, which is 9 pages because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 times.\n\nTherefore, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 = 50.\n\nTotal tens place 8's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times. That's a difference of 1 more 4.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, the digit changes every 100 pages. For a 488-page book, the hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and then 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, 400-488 would have the hundreds digit as 4, right?\n\nWait, let me clarify. Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 or 1? Wait, no, actually, page 1 is just 1, so the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99. Then, pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1. Pages 200-299: 2. Pages 300-399: 3. Pages 400-488: 4.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 4 only in pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nNow, does the hundreds digit ever have an 8? In a 488-page book, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, the hundreds place contributes 0 to the count of 8's.\n\nTherefore, total hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\nTotal hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, now, let's sum up all the digits:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n\n- Tens place: 50\n\n- Hundreds place: 89\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n\n- Tens place: 49\n\n- Hundreds place: 0\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did the hundreds place correctly. Pages 400-488: that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 89 times the hundreds digit is 4. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but when I did the tens place, I had 401-488, which is 88 pages. So, in the hundreds place, it's 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, that's correct.\n\nLet me also check the tens place again. From 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages, and tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 10 and 9, which added to the 40 from the complete hundreds, gives 50 and 49 respectively. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place: 49 each, so 49 + 49 = 98 for both, but 4's have 49 and 8's have 49, so same there.\n\nWait, but when I added up, I had 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 for 4's, and 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 for 8's. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I thought maybe 4's would have more in the hundreds place, but 8's don't appear there at all, so that's a big difference. So, the total is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the units place. Let me recount the units digits.\n\nUnits place: For each 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once. So, 488 pages divided by 10 is 48 full sets, each contributing one 4 and one 8. So, 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8. So, in these, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units 4's: 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but when I did the tens place, I considered 401-488, which is 88 pages. The tens digit cycles every 10 pages, so from 0 to 8. For each tens digit, how many times does it appear?\n\nWait, in 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear? For tens digits 0-7, each appears 10 times because each group of 10 pages (like 401-410, 411-420, etc.) has the same tens digit for 10 pages. But for the last group, 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but there are only 9 pages (480-488 inclusive). So, for tens digit 8, it's 9 times.\n\nWait, but when I calculated earlier, I thought that in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times, and 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but 401-488 is 88 pages, right? Because 488 - 400 = 88, but since we include both 400 and 488, it's 89 pages. Wait, no, 400 is included in 401-488? Wait, 401 is the first page after 400. So, 400 is page 400, and 401 is the next. So, 400 is not included in 401-488. So, 401-488 is 488 - 400 = 88 pages, but since both ends are inclusive, it's 488 - 401 + 1 = 88 pages. So, 88 pages in total.\n\nSo, the tens digit in 401-488 cycles through 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (480-488). Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which is 8 and appears 9 times because 488 is the last page.\n\nWait, but 401-410: tens digit 0, 10 pages.\n\n411-420: tens digit 1, 10 pages.\n\n...\n\n471-480: tens digit 7, 10 pages.\n\n481-490: tens digit 8, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 pages. Wait, no, 481-490 would be 10 pages, but we only have up to 488, so 481-488 is 8 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times? Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier thought.\n\nWait, let me list the tens digits:\n\nFrom 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 pages).\n\n411-420: 1 (10 pages).\n\n421-430: 2 (10 pages).\n\n431-440: 3 (10 pages).\n\n441-450: 4 (10 pages).\n\n451-460: 5 (10 pages).\n\n461-470: 6 (10 pages).\n\n471-480: 7 (10 pages).\n\n481-490: 8, but since we only go to 488, it's 481-488: 8 pages.\n\nSo, the tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 pages, not 9. So, that's 8 times, not 9.\n\nWait, but 488 - 480 = 8, so 481-488 is 8 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in 401-488.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 9 times because 480-488 is 9 pages, but 480 is page 480, which is in the previous group (471-480). So, 480 is included in the 7's tens digit group, right? Because 471-480 includes 480. So, 480 is part of the 7's, and 481-490 would be the next group, but we only go up to 488. So, 481-488 is 8 pages, so tens digit 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSimilarly, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 pages.\n\nSo, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place:\n\n- 4's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 = 50.\n\n- 8's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 8 = 48.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought 8's in the tens place were 49, but now I'm seeing it's 48. So, I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nIn the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times.\n\nThe tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, but 480 is part of the previous group (471-480), so 480 is included in the 7's. Therefore, 481-488 is 8 pages, so tens digit 8 appears 8 times.\n\nTherefore, in the incomplete hundred, tens digit 4: 10, tens digit 8: 8.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nTotal tens place 8's: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nSo, now, recalculating the total counts:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n\n- Tens: 50\n\n- Hundreds: 89\n\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n\n- Tens: 48\n\n- Hundreds: 0\n\nTotal: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that's different from my previous calculation. So, I must have made a mistake earlier in counting the tens place for 8's.\n\nWait, let me go through this again carefully.\n\nFirst, units place: 488 pages.\n\nEach 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place.\n\n488 / 10 = 48 full sets, each contributing 1 to 4 and 1 to 8.\n\nThen, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8.\n\nIn these, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n\nSo, units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nUnits place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach 100 pages, the tens digit cycles 0-9, each appearing 10 times.\n\nSo, in 1-100: tens digits 0-9 each appear 10 times.\n\nSimilarly for 101-200, etc.\n\nSo, 4 complete hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, 4 * 10 = 40 for both 4's and 8's.\n\nNow, the incomplete hundred: 401-488.\n\nIn this range, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but we only go to 488).\n\nSo, let's list the tens digits:\n\n- 0: 401-410 \u2192 10 pages.\n\n- 1: 411-420 \u2192 10 pages.\n\n- 2: 421-430 \u2192 10 pages.\n\n- 3: 431-440 \u2192 10 pages.\n\n- 4: 441-450 \u2192 10 pages.\n\n- 5: 451-460 \u2192 10 pages.\n\n- 6: 461-470 \u2192 10 pages.\n\n- 7: 471-480 \u2192 10 pages.\n\n- 8: 481-488 \u2192 8 pages.\n\nSo, in the incomplete hundred:\n\n- Tens digit 4: 10 pages (441-450).\n\n- Tens digit 8: 8 pages (481-488).\n\nTherefore, in the tens place:\n\n- 4's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 = 50.\n\n- 8's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 8 = 48.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 400-488 \u2192 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\n- 8's: 0 times, since the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, total counts:\n\n4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n\n- Tens: 50\n\n- Hundreds: 89\n\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n\n- Tens: 48\n\n- Hundreds: 0\n\nTotal: 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 90, but after correcting the tens place count, it's 91.\n\nWait, let me check again.\n\nWait, 488 pages.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 48 full sets of 10: 48 each.\n\n- Remaining 8 pages: 481-488.\n\nIn these, units digits: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nSo, 4 appears once (484), 8 appears once (488).\n\nThus, units 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nUnits 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nComplete hundreds (1-400): 4 sets, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, 4 * 10 = 40 each.\n\nIncomplete hundred (401-488):\n\nTens digits:\n\n0: 401-410 \u2192 10.\n\n1: 411-420 \u219210.\n\n2: 421-430 \u219210.\n\n3: 431-440 \u219210.\n\n4: 441-450 \u219210.\n\n5: 451-460 \u219210.\n\n6: 461-470 \u219210.\n\n7: 471-480 \u219210.\n\n8: 481-488 \u21928.\n\nSo, in the incomplete hundred, tens digit 4: 10, tens digit 8:8.\n\nThus, total tens 4's: 40 +10=50.\n\nTotal tens 8's:40 +8=48.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n400-488: 89 pages, so hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nHundreds digit 8: 0.\n\nThus, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 90, but after correcting the tens place for 8's, it's 91.\n\nWait, but let me check the incomplete hundred again. 401-488 is 88 pages, right? 488-401+1=88.\n\nIn that range, how many times does the tens digit 8 appear?\n\nIt's from 480-488, but 480 is included in the previous group (471-480), so 480 is part of the 7's. Therefore, the tens digit 8 starts at 481, so 481-488 is 8 pages, so 8 times.\n\nTherefore, 8's in the tens place:40 +8=48.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188-97=91.\n\nWait, but let me think again: 4's in hundreds place:89, 8's:0.\n\n4's in tens:50, 8's:48.\n\n4's in units:49, 8's:49.\n\nSo, 89+50+49=188.\n\n0+48+49=97.\n\n188-97=91.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think I made a mistake earlier when I thought the tens digit 8 appeared 9 times; it's actually 8 times because 480 is included in the 7's group, so 481-488 is 8 pages.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything else.\n\nWait, another way to calculate the number of 4's and 8's is to consider each digit place separately.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10)*1 + min(488%10,4-0) if the digit is 4.\n\nWait, maybe a better formula is:\n\nFor a digit d in the units place, the count is:\n\ncomplete sets of 10: floor(n/10) *1.\n\nplus, if the remaining pages (n%10) >= d, add 1.\n\nSo, for 4 in units place:\n\ncomplete sets: floor(488/10)=48.\n\nremaining:488%10=8.\n\nSince 8 >=4, add 1.\n\nTotal 4's in units:48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly for 8:\n\ncomplete sets:48.\n\nremaining:8 >=8, add 1.\n\nTotal 8's in units:48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor tens digit d, the count is:\n\ncomplete sets of 100: floor(n/100)*10.\n\nplus, in the remaining pages, the number of times d appears in the tens place.\n\nFor 4 in tens place:\n\ncomplete sets: floor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40.\n\nremaining pages:488%100=88.\n\nIn the last 88 pages (1-88), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nIt's in 40-49, which is 10 pages, but since we're only going up to 88, 40-49 is fully included, so 10 times.\n\nThus, total 4's in tens place:40+10=50.\n\nFor 8 in tens place:\n\ncomplete sets:4*10=40.\n\nremaining pages:88.\n\nIn the last 88 pages, 8 in tens place is 80-89, but since we only go up to 88, it's 80-88, which is 9 pages.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 8 pages because 481-488 is 8 pages, but that's in the hundreds place. Wait, no, in the tens place, it's 80-88, which is 9 pages.\n\nWait, but wait, in the overall book, the tens digit 8 in the last 88 pages would be in 80-88, which is 9 pages.\n\nBut in the context of the entire book, the tens digit 8 can appear in multiple hundreds. Wait, no, the remaining pages after 400 are 401-488, which is 88 pages. So, in this range, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488). Wait, but 480 is in the hundreds place of 4, so in the tens place, 480 would have 8 in the tens digit, right? Wait, 480 is 4 8 0, so the tens digit is 8.\n\nWait, but in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 8 times because I was considering the range from 481-488 as 8 pages, but that's incorrect because 480 is included in 401-488, so 480 is part of the incomplete hundred, making it 9 pages where the tens digit is 8.\n\nWait, but 401-488 is 88 pages, so 401 is the first page, and 488 is the last. So, 480 is within this range, so 480-488 is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). Therefore, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the incomplete hundred.\n\nWait, so that would mean that in the tens place, the count for 8's is 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 8 because I was considering 481-488 as 8 pages, but that's not correct because 480 is included in the incomplete hundred.\n\nWait, so let me clarify:\n\nWhen considering the tens digit in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place:\n\n- 4's:40 +10=50.\n\n- 8's:40 +9=49.\n\nSo, that brings the total 8's in tens place to 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that 480 is part of the 471-480 group, but that's incorrect because 471-480 is 10 pages, ending at 480, so 480 is included in the 7's tens digit group. Therefore, in the incomplete hundred, the tens digit 8 starts at 481, so 481-488 is 8 pages, so 8 times.\n\nWait, but 480 is in the previous group, so in the incomplete hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 8 starts at 481, making it 8 pages. So, 8 times.\n\nTherefore, the count for 8's in the tens place is 40 +8=48.\n\nWait, now I'm confused because depending on how I look at it, it's either 8 or 9.\n\nWait, let's list the pages where the tens digit is 8 in 401-488.\n\nThe tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488.\n\nBut 480 is included in 401-488, so that's 9 pages: 480,481,...,488.\n\nBut wait, 480 is part of the 401-488 range, so the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages.\n\nBut wait, 480 is in the 401-488 range, so the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that 480 is part of the 471-480 group, which has the hundreds digit 4 and tens digit 7. Wait, no, the tens digit is separate from the hundreds digit.\n\nWait, 480 is 4 (hundreds), 8 (tens), 0 (units). So, the tens digit is 8, so in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place, the count for 8's in the incomplete hundred is 9.\n\nThus, total tens place 8's:40 +9=49.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier thought that 480 is part of the previous group. So, perhaps I was mistaken earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to think about it is that in the range 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times.\n\nTherefore, total 8's in tens place:40 +9=49.\n\nSo, then, total 8's would be:\n\n- Units:49\n\n- Tens:49\n\n- Hundreds:0\n\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nAnd 4's:\n\n- Units:49\n\n- Tens:50\n\n- Hundreds:89\n\nTotal:49+50+89=188.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so now I'm getting 90 again. So, perhaps my initial correction was wrong, and the correct count is 90.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify whether 480 is included in the incomplete hundred.\n\nSince the incomplete hundred is 401-488, which includes 480, then the tens digit 8 in 480 is part of this range, so it should be counted.\n\nTherefore, in the incomplete hundred, tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages.\n\nTherefore, total tens place 8's:40 +9=49.\n\nThus, total 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\n4's:49 (units)+50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that 480 is part of the 471-480 group, which is in the previous hundred (301-400). But no, 401-488 is the next hundred, so 480 is within 401-488.\n\nWait, 401-488 includes 480, so the tens digit 8 in 480 is part of this range.\n\nTherefore, in the incomplete hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times, so total 49.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 90.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total complete sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 sets.\n   - Pages remaining after 48 sets: 8 pages (481-488).\n   - Count of '4's: 48 (complete sets) + 1 (484) = 49.\n   - Count of '8's: 48 (complete sets) + 1 (488) = 49.\n\n2. **T"

    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should understand how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers will be from 1 up to 488, which means the maximum number of digits per page number is three.\n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll count the number of 4's and 8's in each place and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place goes from 0 to 9. Therefore, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place every 10 pages.\n\nSo, for the units place, the number of times 4 appears can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then considering any remainder. Similarly for 8.\n\nTotal pages: 488.\n\nNumber of complete blocks of 10 in 488 pages: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, with 8 remaining pages.\n\nIn each complete block, 4 appears once in the units place, and 8 appears once.\n\nSo, for the units place:\n- Number of 4's: 48 (from complete blocks) + 1 (since in the remaining 8 pages, the units digits go from 0 to 8, so 4 appears once) = 49\n- Number of 8's: 48 (from complete blocks) + 1 (since 8 appears in the remaining pages) = 49\n\nWait, let me check that. The remaining 8 pages after 48 blocks (which is 480 pages) would be pages 481 to 488. So, the units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So yes, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So units place gives 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nThe tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for example, in 0-99, the tens digit is 0 for 10 numbers (0-9), 1 for 10 numbers (10-19), and so on up to 9 for 90-99.\n\nSo, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and similarly for 8.\n\nTotal pages: 488. So, how many complete hundreds do we have? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 pages (401-488).\n\nFor the tens place:\n\nIn each complete hundred, 4 appears 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40 times. Similarly, 8 appears 40 times.\n\nNow, the remaining 88 pages: 401-488.\n\nIn this range, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 in the tens place, but let's see how many times each digit appears.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 times).\n\nSo, for each digit in the tens place from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear?\n\nFor the tens digit 0: 401-410, that's 10 pages, but since we're starting at 401, it's 401-410, which is 10 pages. Wait, but 488 is less than 490, so the tens digit 8 only goes up to 488, which is 8 pages (481-488).\n\nWait, actually, let me think again. From 401-488, the tens digit cycles as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 numbers)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10 numbers)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10 numbers)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10 numbers)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 numbers)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10 numbers)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10 numbers)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10 numbers)\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 numbers)\n\nSo, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and the tens digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n\nSo, for the tens place in the remaining 88 pages:\n- Number of 4's: 10\n- Number of 8's: 8\n\nTherefore, total tens place counts:\n- 4's: 4 (hundreds) * 10 = 40, plus 10 in the remaining, total 50\n- 8's: 4 * 10 = 40, plus 8 in the remaining, total 48\n\nWait, let me check that again. Each complete hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would be 40 each. Then, in the remaining 88 pages, 441-450 adds 10 more 4's, and 481-488 adds 8 more 8's. So yes, 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50, 8's:40 +8=48.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nThe hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. For pages 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, which doesn't count. So, starting from page 100, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4, since the book goes up to 488.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\n- Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's here.\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's.\n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, no 4's or 8's.\n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, no 4's or 8's.\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so here, 4 appears in the hundreds place for each of these pages.\n\nSo, how many pages are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, meaning 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, do 8's appear in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. The hundreds digits are 0,1,2,3,4. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, hundreds place:\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:48\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49 +48 +0 =97\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -97 =91.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, units place:\n- 488 pages, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8 in units. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have 4 at 484 and 8 at 488. So, units: 48 +1=49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. 4 hundreds: 4*10=40 each.\n- Then, the remaining 88 pages (401-488) have 441-450 (10 pages) contributing 10 4's, and 481-488 (8 pages) contributing 8 8's.\n- So, tens place: 4's=40+10=50, 8's=40+8=48.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 400-488: 89 pages, so 89 4's. 8's:0.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 -400 +1=89 pages. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to check: maybe I can think of the total number of digits printed and see if the counts make sense, but that might be more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each place again to make sure.\n\nUnits place:\n- For 488 pages, the number of times 4 appears in units place: floor(488/10)=48, and if the remainder is >=4, add 1. 488 mod 10=8, which is >=4, so 48+1=49.\nSame for 8: floor(488/10)=48, remainder=8, which is >=8, so 48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds:4*10=40 for both 4 and 8.\n- Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? From 440-449, but wait, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, 10 times.\n- Similarly, 8 in the tens place occurs in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages? Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 pages, but 480 is included, right? Wait, 480 is the start, and 488 is the end. So, 480,481,...,488: that's 9 pages. But earlier I thought it was 8. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, 480 is page 480, which is included, and 488 is the last page. So, the number of pages from 480 to 488 inclusive is 488 -480 +1=9 pages. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages, not 8. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. It should be 9, not 8.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 8 because I was considering 481-488, which is 8 pages, but 480 is also part of the tens digit 8 in the tens place. So, actually, from 480-488, that's 9 pages where the tens digit is 8.\n\nWait, so let me correct that.\n\nIn the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, in the tens place, 8's would be 40 (from complete hundreds) +9=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 8, but that was a mistake. It's actually 9. So, that changes things.\n\nWait, let me go through this again carefully.\n\nTotal pages:488.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 400-488: 89 pages, so 89 4's in hundreds place.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds:40 each.\n- Now, the remaining 88 pages:401-488.\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-489, but since we stop at 488, it's 480-488).\n\nSo, for each tens digit:\n\n- 0:401-410 \u2192 10 pages\n- 1:411-420 \u219210\n- 2:421-430\u219210\n- 3:431-440\u219210\n- 4:441-450\u219210\n- 5:451-460\u219210\n- 6:461-470\u219210\n- 7:471-480\u219210\n- 8:481-488\u21928 pages? Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 pages because 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9.\n\nWait, 480 is included, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 pages: 480,481,...,488.\n\nSo, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the remaining 88 pages.\n\nTherefore, for the tens place:\n- 4's:40 (from hundreds) +10 (from 441-450) =50\n- 8's:40 +9=49\n\nSo, earlier I had 8 instead of 9 for the 8's in the tens place, which was a mistake. So, correcting that, the total 8's in the tens place would be 49, not 48.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this.\n\nWait, the remaining 88 pages are 401-488.\n\nLooking at the tens digits:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0\n- 411-420:1\n- 421-430:2\n- 431-440:3\n- 441-450:4\n- 451-460:5\n- 461-470:6\n- 471-480:7\n- 481-488:8\n\nWait, 481-488 is 8 pages, but 480 is part of the previous set (471-480). So, 480 is included in the 471-480 group, which is 10 pages (471-480). So, 480 is the 10th page in that group.\n\nThen, 481-488 is 8 pages, so the tens digit 8 appears in 8 pages (481-488). Therefore, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times, not 9.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Let me check the exact numbers.\n\n401-410:10 pages, tens digit 0\n411-420:10, tens digit1\n421-430:10, tens digit2\n431-440:10, tens digit3\n441-450:10, tens digit4\n451-460:10, tens digit5\n461-470:10, tens digit6\n471-480:10, tens digit7\n481-490:10, tens digit8\n\nBut since the book ends at 488, the last group is 481-488, which is 8 pages, so tens digit8 appears 8 times.\n\nTherefore, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit8 appears 8 times, not 9.\n\nSo, earlier I was correct with 8, not 9.\n\nTherefore, the tens place for 8's in the remaining pages is 8, making total 8's in tens place:40 +8=48.\n\nSo, my initial calculation was correct, and I made a mistake when I thought it was 9. It's actually 8.\n\nSo, going back:\n\nTens place:\n- 4's:40 (from hundreds) +10 (from 441-450) =50\n- 8's:40 +8=48\n\nTherefore, total 8's in tens place:48.\n\nSo, total 8's:\n\nUnits place:49\nTens place:48\nHundreds place:0\nTotal:49+48=97\n\nTotal 4's:\n\nUnits place:49\nTens place:50\nHundreds place:89\nTotal:49+50+89=188\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 97, so 188-97=91.\n\nWait, but I want to make sure I didn't miss anything else. Let me think about the hundreds place again. Pages 400-488: that's 488-400+1=89 pages, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: for each page number, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages. So, 89 4's.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n4's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50+89=188\n\n8's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:48\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+48=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nSo, the answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 91.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that each page number is printed once, starting from 1 and going up to 488. So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me break it down by the positions of the digits: units place, tens place, hundreds place, and so on. Since 488 is a three-digit number, I'll consider each digit position separately.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, the digit 4 will appear once every 10 numbers, and the same goes for 8. Therefore, in each set of 10 numbers, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n\nNow, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. In each of these 48 sets, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, that's 48 times each for both digits.\n\nBut wait, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). So, for the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's, so 48 + 1 = 49 as well. Hmm, so in the units place, they are equal.\n\nNext, let's move to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So, for example, in 1-100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8.\n\nSo, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 times 10, which is 40 for both 4's and 8's in the tens place. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nFrom 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles through 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears once in 440-449, which is 10 times, but wait, no. Wait, in the 400s, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, ..., 4 for 440-449, and 8 for 480-488. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times because from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the remaining 88 pages.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. From 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times, except maybe the last one if it's cut short. But 488 is the last page, so in the 400s, the tens digit goes up to 8, but only up to 488.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to break it down. From 401-410: tens digit is 0, 411-420: 1, ..., 441-450: 4, 451-460:5, 461-470:6, 471-480:7, 481-490:8. But since we only go up to 488, the last set is 481-488, which is 8 numbers, not 10. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 times, and the digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 times. So, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place, total 4's are 40 (from the four hundreds) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50. And total 8's are 40 (from the four hundreds) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 48, so 4's are 2 more here.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, for the hundreds digit, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only has 488 pages, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, 8's in the hundreds place are 0.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's are 89 and 8's are 0. So, that's 89 more 4's than 8's here.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. From 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's. From 100-399, the hundreds digit is 1,2,3, so no 4's or 8's. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so 4's in the hundreds place are 89 times (from 400 to 488 inclusive). 8's in the hundreds place never occur because the book ends at 488, so the hundreds digit doesn't reach 8. So, yes, 89 4's and 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let me summarize:\n\n- Units place: 49 4's, 49 8's. Difference: 0.\n- Tens place: 50 4's, 48 8's. Difference: +2.\n- Hundreds place: 89 4's, 0 8's. Difference: +89.\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 2 + 89 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the tens place. Earlier, I thought that in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, adding to the 40 from the four hundreds, 4's in tens place are 50, and 8's are 40 +8=48. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for those 8 numbers, so 8 times. So, yes, 8 times.\n\nWait, but let me check if 441-450 is 10 numbers, so 441,442,...,450. That's 10 numbers, so the tens digit is 4 for 10 times. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, let me add up all the 4's and 8's.\n\nTotal 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:48\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal 8's:49 +48 +0=97.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -97=91.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- Each 10 numbers, one 4 and one 8. 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8. So, 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So, units place:48+1=49 for both.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each hundred, 10 times each digit in the tens place. So, 4 appears 10 times per hundred, 8 appears 10 times per hundred.\n\n- There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). So, 4*10=40 for both 4's and 8's in the tens place.\n\n- Then, in 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 times. The digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 times. So, adding to the 40, 4's in tens place:40+10=50; 8's:40+8=48.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- From 400-488, hundreds digit is 4, so 89 times (since 488-400+1=89). 8's in hundreds place:0.\n\nSo, total 4's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50=99; 99+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:48\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+48=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't count any digits twice or miss any. For example, in the number 444, the digit 4 appears three times, so each occurrence should be counted separately. Similarly, in 488, the digit 8 appears twice, so each occurrence is counted.\n\nWait, so when I count the units, tens, and hundreds separately, each digit is counted per position. So, for 444, it would contribute one 4 in units, one in tens, and one in hundreds. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, 488 would contribute one 8 in units, one in tens, and zero in hundreds. Wait, no, 488 is 4-8-8, so units digit is 8, tens digit is 8, hundreds digit is 4. So, in the units place, that's one 8, in the tens place, that's one 8, and in the hundreds place, that's one 4. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I considered 488 as contributing to the units place 8 and to the tens place 8. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I was counting the hundreds place, I considered 400-488 as 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the total number of 4's and 8's again.\n\nTotal 4's:188\n\nTotal 8's:97\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nHmm, that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me try another approach to confirm.\n\nAnother way to count the number of times a digit appears is to consider each digit position separately and calculate how many times the digit appears in that position from 1 to N, where N is 488.\n\nSo, for the units place, as before, it's floor(488/10)*1 + min(488%10,4) if digit is 4, but wait, no, maybe it's better to use the standard formula.\n\nWait, actually, the standard formula for counting the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is:\n\ncount_units = (N // 10) * 1 + min(max(N % 10 - d + 1, 0), 10)\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's simpler to think that for each complete set of 10 numbers, the digit appears once in the units place, and then for the remaining numbers, check if the digit is present.\n\nSo, for digit 4 in units place:\n\nNumber of complete sets of 10:488//10=48\n\nEach contributes 1, so 48.\n\nThen, the remaining numbers are 488%10=8. So, from 481 to 488, how many numbers have units digit 4? Only 484, so 1.\n\nTotal units place 4's:48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place:\n\nSame calculation:48 complete sets, each contributes 1, so 48.\n\nRemaining numbers:481-488. Units digits 1-8. So, 488 has units digit 8, so 1 more.\n\nTotal units place 8's:48+1=49.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nNow, for the tens place.\n\nThe formula for the tens place is a bit more involved.\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to N can be calculated as:\n\ncount_tens = (N // 100) * 10\n\nremainder = N % 100\n\nif remainder >= 10*d:\n    count_tens += 10\nelse:\n    count_tens += remainder - 10*d + 1\n\nBut only if d !=0.\n\nWait, let me test this formula.\n\nFor digit 4 in the tens place:\n\nN=488.\n\nN//100=4 (since 4*100=400 <=488).\n\nSo, count_tens=4*10=40.\n\nremainder=488%100=88.\n\nNow, 10*d=40.\n\nIs 88 >=40? Yes.\n\nSo, count_tens +=10.\n\nSo, total count_tens=40+10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8 in the tens place:\n\nN=488.\n\nN//100=4.\n\ncount_tens=4*10=40.\n\nremainder=88.\n\n10*d=80.\n\nIs 88 >=80? Yes.\n\nSo, count_tens +=10.\n\nWait, but wait, 88 >=80, so we add 10, but wait, in the tens place, from 400 to 488, the tens digit can go up to 8 (in 480-488). So, the digit 8 in the tens place appears in 480-489, but since N=488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times, not 10.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, it's adding 10, which would be incorrect. So, perhaps the formula is not accurate for the upper end when the remainder is less than 100.\n\nWait, let me think again. The formula is:\n\ncount_tens = (N // 100) * 10\n\nremainder = N % 100\n\nif remainder >= 10*d:\n    count_tens +=10\nelse:\n    count_tens += remainder - 10*d +1\n\nBut for d=8, 10*d=80.\n\nIf remainder=88, which is >=80, so we add 10. But in reality, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers, not 10.\n\nSo, perhaps the formula isn't accurate when the remainder is less than 100 but the digit is in the tens place.\n\nWait, maybe I should adjust the formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the number of times the tens digit is 4 or 8.\n\nFor the tens digit:\n\nEach hundred block (e.g., 1-100, 101-200, etc.) contributes exactly 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place, except possibly the last block if N is not a multiple of 100.\n\nSo, for N=488, which is 4 hundreds and 88.\n\nSo, for digit 4 in the tens place:\n\nIn each of the first four hundreds, 10 times. So, 4*10=40.\n\nIn the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8.\n\nHow many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? It appears once in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place:40+10=50.\n\nFor digit 8 in the tens place:\n\nIn each of the first four hundreds, 10 times. So, 4*10=40.\n\nIn the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 times.\n\nSo, total 8's in tens place:40+9=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, so now I'm getting a discrepancy.\n\nWait, earlier I thought that in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times, but now I'm seeing it's 9 times. Which is correct?\n\nWait, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488. So, 480 is included, and 488 is included. So, 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers (since 488-480+1=9). So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the last partial hundred.\n\nTherefore, total 8's in tens place:40+9=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 48. So, I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, so let me correct that.\n\nIn the tens place:\n\n- 4's:50\n- 8's:49\n\nSo, difference in tens place:50-49=+1.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 48 for 8's in tens place, but now it's 49. So, I must have miscalculated earlier.\n\nWait, let me recount.\n\nIn the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 is in 480-488.\n\nHow many numbers is that? 488-480+1=9 numbers:480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488.\n\nSo, that's 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, 9 times.\n\nTherefore, total 8's in tens place:40+9=49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's are 50, 8's are 49, so difference is +1.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, both are 49, so difference 0.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4's are 89, 8's are 0, so difference +89.\n\nTotal difference:0+1+89=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 91. So, now I'm getting 90.\n\nWait, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, let me recalculate total 4's and 8's.\n\nTotal 4's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50=99; 99+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought the tens place for 8's was 48, leading to total 8's as 97, but now it's 49, leading to 98.\n\nSo, which is correct?\n\nWait, let me recount the 8's in the tens place.\n\nFrom 1-400:\n\nEach hundred has 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 hundreds:4*10=40.\n\nFrom 401-488:\n\nThe tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo, total 8's in tens place:40+9=49.\n\nTherefore, total 8's:49(units)+49(tens)+0(hundreds)=98.\n\nTotal 4's:49(units)+50(tens)+89(hundreds)=188.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought the 8's in tens place were 48, but now I'm seeing it's 49. So, where did I go wrong earlier?\n\nAh, I think I made a mistake earlier when I thought that in the last partial hundred, the 8's in tens place were 8 times. Actually, it's 9 times because 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, that's the error. So, the correct total is 98 for 8's, leading to a difference of 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure.\n\nWait, 480 is included, right? So, 480 is part of the 401-488 range, so it's included. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, each with a tens digit of 8.\n\nSo, 9 times.\n\nTherefore, 8's in tens place:49.\n\nSo, total 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 91 because I thought the 8's in tens place were 48, but now I'm seeing it's 49, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check again.\n\nWait, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times.\n\nTherefore, 8's in tens place:40+9=49.\n\nSo, yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 91, but now it's 90.\n\nWait, let me check the total counts again.\n\nTotal 4's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50=99; 99+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the initial mistake was in the tens place for 8's, where I thought it was 8 times instead of 9 times. So, the correct difference is 90.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting '4's and '8's in the Units Place:**\n   - For every 10 consecutive numbers, both '4' and '8' appear once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 each.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) contribute one '4' (484) and one '8' (488).\n   - **Total in units place:** 49 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n2. **Counting '4's and '8's in the Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n   - For the first 400 pages, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 '4's and 10 '8's.\n   - From 401-488, '4' appears 10 times (440-449), and '8' appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - **Total in tens place:** 50 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n3. **Counting '4's and '8's in the Hundreds Place:**\n   - From 400-488, the hundreds digit is '4' for 89 pages.\n   - '8' never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 89 '4's and 0 '8's.\n\n4. **Summing Up:**\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n   - **Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe digit '4' is printed 90 times more than the digit '8'.  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should understand how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, pages 1-9 are single-digit, 10-99 are two-digit, and 100-488 are three-digit numbers.\n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll break this down by the number of digits in the page numbers.\n\n1. **Single-digit page numbers (1-9):**\n   - The digit 4 appears once, which is on page 4.\n   - So, number of 4's here is 1.\n\n2. **Two-digit page numbers (10-99):**\n   - Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place.\n   - Let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place.\n\n   a. **Tens place:**\n      - Pages from 40-49 have 4 in the tens place. That's 10 pages, so 10 occurrences of 4.\n   \n   b. **Units place:**\n      - The digit 4 appears every 10 pages, starting from 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but since we're only going up to page 99, let me count them.\n      - From 10-99, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 4 appears once in each set of 10. There are 9 sets (10-19, 20-29,...,90-99), but actually, from 10-99, there are 9 decades (10-19 is the first, 20-29 the second, etc., up to 90-99). Wait, no, actually, 10-99 is 90 numbers, so 9 decades. But each decade has one 4 in the units place, except maybe the 40-49 decade, which we've already counted in the tens place. Wait, no, in the units place, 40-49 would have 4 in the units place as well, but we've already counted the tens place. Wait, no, actually, in the units place, 4 appears once every 10 numbers, regardless of the tens digit. So, from 10-99, how many 4's in the units place? Let's see: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 times. But wait, 44 is already counted in the tens place, but when counting units and tens separately, we should count both. So, the tens place gives 10 (40-49), and the units place gives 9 (14,24,...,94). So total 4's in two-digit numbers: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 10-99, the number of 4's in the tens place is 10 (40-49), and in the units place, it's 9 because 44 is already counted in the tens place, but actually, when counting units and tens separately, each occurrence is counted, so 44 would have both a tens and a units 4, so both are counted. So, in units place, from 10-99, it's 9 times, but wait, 44 is included in that. So total 4's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nWait, but let me list them to be sure. Units place 4's: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So yes, 9. Tens place: 40-49, which is 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. So total 19.\n\n3. **Three-digit page numbers (100-488):**\n   - Now, these are from 100 to 488. Each page number has hundreds, tens, and units digits.\n   - I need to count how many times 4 appears in each place.\n\n   a. **Hundreds place:**\n      - Pages from 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. That's 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive). So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\n   b. **Tens place:**\n      - Now, let's look at the tens digit. The tens digit can be 0-9, and we need to find how many times 4 appears in the tens place across all three-digit numbers from 100-488.\n\n      - For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), we can calculate the number of times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\n      - 100-199: The tens digit is 4 in the range 140-149. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n      - 200-299: Similarly, 240-249: 10 occurrences.\n      - 300-399: 340-349: 10 occurrences.\n      - 400-488: The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, but wait, 488 is the last page. So, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but does 449 exist? Yes, because 488 is the last page, so 449 is included. So, 10 occurrences.\n\n      - So, total 4's in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40.\n\n   c. **Units place:**\n      - Now, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, we can calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place.\n\n      - 100-199: The units digit is 4 in 104,114,124,134,144,154,164,174,184,194. That's 10 times.\n      - 200-299: Similarly, 204,214,...,294: 10 times.\n      - 300-399: 304,314,...,394: 10 times.\n      - 400-488: Now, units digit 4 occurs at 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. Wait, but 484 is within 488, so that's 9 times? Wait, let me count: from 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs at 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 times because 484 is the last one before 488. Wait, but 404 is the first, and each subsequent 10 pages, so 404,414,...,484. How many terms are there? From 404 to 484 with step 10: (484 - 404)/10 + 1 = (80)/10 +1 = 8 +1 =9. So 9 times.\n\n      - So total 4's in units place: 10 (100-199) +10 (200-299)+10 (300-399)+9 (400-488) = 39.\n\n   - Now, summing up the three-digit numbers: hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89+40=129+39=168.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the three-digit counts because this seems a bit high.\n\nWait, for the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 pages, correct. So 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nFor the tens place, in each hundred (100-199, etc.), 10 times each, so 4 hundreds, but wait, 400-488 is only part of the 400s. Wait, no, when I broke it down earlier, I considered 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So in each of the first three, the tens place 4 occurs 10 times, and in 400-488, it's 10 times as well because 440-449 is within 400-488. So 4 times 10 is 40, correct.\n\nFor the units place, in 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each have 10 4's in the units place, but in 400-488, it's only 9 because 484 is the last one before 488. So 10+10+10+9=39, correct.\n\nSo total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89+40+39=168.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:168\n\nTotal 4's:1+19=20+168=188.\n\nWait, 1+19 is 20, plus 168 is 188. Hmm.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\n1. **Single-digit page numbers (1-9):**\n   - The digit 8 appears once, on page 8.\n   - So, number of 8's here is 1.\n\n2. **Two-digit page numbers (10-99):**\n   - Again, count 8's in tens and units places.\n\n   a. **Tens place:**\n      - Pages from 80-89 have 8 in the tens place. That's 10 pages, so 10 occurrences.\n\n   b. **Units place:**\n      - The digit 8 appears every 10 pages: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 times because 88 is included, but we're counting units and tens separately. So, 9 occurrences.\n\n   - So, total 8's in two-digit numbers:10 (tens) +9 (units)=19.\n\n3. **Three-digit page numbers (100-488):**\n   - Now, counting 8's in hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\n   a. **Hundreds place:**\n      - The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences.\n\n   b. **Tens place:**\n      - Let's look at each hundred:\n\n      - 100-199: The tens digit is 8 in 180-189. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n      - 200-299: Similarly, 280-289: 10 occurrences.\n      - 300-399: 380-389: 10 occurrences.\n      - 400-488: The tens digit is 8 in 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 occurrences.\n\n      - So, total 8's in the tens place:10+10+10+9=39.\n\n   c. **Units place:**\n      - For each hundred, count how many times 8 appears in the units place.\n\n      - 100-199: The units digit is 8 in 108,118,128,138,148,158,168,178,188,198. That's 10 times.\n      - 200-299: Similarly, 208,218,...,298: 10 times.\n      - 300-399: 308,318,...,398: 10 times.\n      - 400-488: The units digit is 8 in 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 times because 488 is included.\n\n      - So, total 8's in the units place:10+10+10+9=39.\n\n   - Now, summing up the three-digit numbers: tens place (39) + units place (39) =78.\n\nWait, but let me check: hundreds place is 0, tens place is 39, units place is 39. So total 8's in three-digit numbers:39+39=78.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:78\n\nTotal 8's:1+19=20+78=98.\n\nWait, so total 4's are 188, and total 8's are 98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 - 98 =90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, for the 4's:\n\n- Single-digit:1\n- Two-digit:19\n- Three-digit:168\nTotal:1+19=20+168=188.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\n- Single-digit:1\n- Two-digit:19\n- Three-digit:78\nTotal:1+19=20+78=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But let me check if I made a mistake in counting the three-digit numbers for 4's and 8's.\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers for 4's:\n\n- Hundreds place:400-488:89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n- Tens place:100-199:140-149:10\n  200-299:240-249:10\n  300-399:340-349:10\n  400-488:440-449:10\nTotal tens:40\n- Units place:100-199:104,114,...,194:10\n  200-299:204,...,294:10\n  300-399:304,...,394:10\n  400-488:404,414,...,484:9\nTotal units:39\nSo, 89+40+39=168. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place:0\n- Tens place:\n  100-199:180-189:10\n  200-299:280-289:10\n  300-399:380-389:10\n  400-488:480-488:9\nTotal tens:39\n- Units place:\n  100-199:108,...,198:10\n  200-299:208,...,298:10\n  300-399:308,...,398:10\n  400-488:408,...,488:9\nTotal units:39\nSo, 39+39=78. That seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the difference is indeed 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the units place for 4's in three-digit numbers. From 400-488, units digit 4 occurs at 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 times, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place in 400-488:408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 times, correct.\n\nSo, I think the calculations are correct. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is 188, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Because the number of times a digit appears can vary depending on its position. So, I'll handle each place one by one.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, pages 4, 14, 24, etc. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once every 10 pages in the units place, like 8, 18, 28, etc.\n\nSo, for the units place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, from page 1 to 488, there are 488 pages. Dividing 488 by 10 gives me 48 full groups of 10, and then there are 8 pages left over. In each full group, 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more. So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, in each group of 10, 8 appears once, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages, 8 appears once (page 488). So total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So, the difference here is zero. Hmm, interesting.\n\nNow moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every 100 pages. So, for example, in pages 00-09, the tens digit is 0; 10-19, it's 1; and so on. So, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place for every 100 pages, same with 8.\n\nLet's calculate how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The book has 488 pages, so we can think of it as 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, 4 appears 10 times per hundred. Since there are 4 full hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for pages 401-410? Wait, no. Wait, 401-410 would have tens digit 0, right? Because 401 is 4 0 1, 410 is 4 1 0. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490). But since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 appears from 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 401-410, which is 10 pages, right? Because 401-410: the tens digit is 0, so wait, that's not correct.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The tens digit is 4 in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges is 10 pages. So, how many such ranges are there in 488 pages?\n\nFrom 1-488, the ranges where tens digit is 4 are:\n\n- 40-49: 10 pages\n- 140-149: 10 pages\n- 240-249: 10 pages\n- 340-349: 10 pages\n- 440-449: 10 pages\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 times. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, when I thought earlier, I considered 4 full hundreds and then some. Maybe I need to reconcile this.\n\nWait, 488 pages. The hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 400-488. So, the tens digit cycles 0-9 for each hundred. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40. But wait, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 would be in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, that's 4 hundreds giving 40, plus 10 from 440-449, totaling 50. So, 4's in tens place: 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place. The ranges where tens digit is 8 are:\n\n- 80-89: 10 pages\n- 180-189: 10 pages\n- 280-289: 10 pages\n- 380-389: 10 pages\n- 480-489: but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488: 9 pages.\n\nWait, so in the first four hundreds, each contributes 10 pages where tens digit is 8, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). So, total 40 + 9 = 49 times. So, 8's in tens place: 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times. So, the difference here is 1.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times, and 8's appear 0 times. So, the difference here is 89.\n\nNow, let's sum up the differences from each place.\n\n- Units place: 49 vs 49 \u2192 difference 0\n- Tens place: 50 vs 49 \u2192 difference +1\n- Hundreds place: 89 vs 0 \u2192 difference +89\n\nSo, total difference is 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each place to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- For 4's: 48 full decades (1-480) give 48 times, and 481-488 has 484, so one more 4. Total 49.\n- For 8's: Similarly, 48 full decades give 48, and 488 adds one more. Total 49.\n- So, units place difference is 0.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For 4's: Each hundred has 10 pages with tens digit 4. There are 4 full hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, total 40+10=50.\n- For 8's: Each hundred has 10 pages with tens digit 8. 4 full hundreds contribute 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, total 40+9=49.\n- So, tens place difference is 50-49=1.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- For 4's: Pages 400-488. 488-400+1=89 pages. So, 89 times.\n- For 8's: No pages have hundreds digit 8, so 0.\n- So, difference here is 89.\n\nAdding up the differences: 0 (units) +1 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For example, in the units place, when I considered 488 pages, I divided by 10 to get 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 and one 8, and then the remaining 8 pages contributing one 4 and one 8. So, 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4's, I had 5 ranges (40-49, 140-149, etc.) each contributing 10, but wait, 440-449 is the fifth range, so that's correct. For 8's, in the last partial hundred, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 49 total.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 4's. And no 8's in hundreds place.\n\nSo, yes, the total difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. We analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - **4's**: 48 full decades (each contributing one 4) + one in the remaining pages (484) = 49.\n   - **8's**: Similarly, 48 full decades + one in 488 = 49.\n   - **Difference**: 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - **4's**: 10 times per hundred for 4 hundreds (400 pages) + 10 in 440-449 = 50.\n   - **8's**: 10 times per hundred for 4 hundreds + 9 in 480-488 = 49.\n   - **Difference**: 50 - 49 = 1.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - **4's**: 89 times (400-488).\n   - **8's**: 0 times.\n   - **Difference**: 89.\n\nSumming the differences: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\n**Answer**: There are 90 more 4's than 8's. \n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that each page from 1 to 488 is numbered once, so I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering how digits are structured in page numbers. Page numbers can be one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit numbers. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to three digits, with the hundreds digit being either 1, 2, 3, or 4 (since 488 is the last page).\n\nI think the best approach is to analyze each digit place separately: the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place. For each place, I'll calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor the units digit, the numbers cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Since we're dealing with page numbers starting at 1, the first block is 1-10, but the units digit here is 1-0, so 0 appears once, and 1-9 appear once each.\n\nWait, but in page 1, the units digit is 1, and in page 10, it's 0. So for each set of 10 pages, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in the units place. But since our book ends at 488, which is not a multiple of 10, the last set will be shorter. Let me figure out how many complete sets of 10 there are and then handle the remaining pages.\n\nTotal pages: 488.\n\nNumber of complete sets of 10 pages: 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So there are 48 complete sets and then 8 more pages (481-488).\n\nIn each complete set of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 appears once as well. So for 48 complete sets, the number of 4's in the units place is 48, and the same for 8's.\n\nNow, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8. So in these, the units digit 4 appears once (page 484) and 8 appears once (page 488). So for the units place, total 4's are 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So the difference here is zero.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, digits cycle every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place within each hundred. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. Similarly, from 100-199, the tens digit again cycles through 0-9 ten times each, and so on.\n\nSo, let's figure out how many complete hundreds we have in 488 pages. 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and the same for 8 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So for each hundred, 10 times each digit appears in the tens place.\n\nTherefore, for 4 complete hundreds, the number of 4's in the tens place is 4 * 10 = 40, and the same for 8's, which is also 40.\n\nNow, the remaining 88 pages are from 401 to 488. Let's look at the tens digit in these pages.\n\nFrom 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each, but only up to 88 pages. Wait, actually, 401-488 is 88 pages, which is 8 full tens (401-410, 411-420, ..., 481-490), but wait, 488 is the last page, so actually, 401-488 is 88 pages, which is 8 full tens (401-410 is 10 pages, 411-420 is another 10, etc., up to 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the last ten is only 8 pages (481-488). Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the tens digit in 401-488. The tens digits here go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). Let me think: from 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, tens digit is 1; 421-430, tens digit is 2; 431-440, tens digit is 3; 441-450, tens digit is 4; 451-460, tens digit is 5; 461-470, tens digit is 6; 471-480, tens digit is 7; and 481-488, tens digit is 8.\n\nWait, but each of these ranges is 10 pages except the last one, which is 8 pages (481-488). So the tens digits in 401-488 are as follows:\n\n- Tens digit 0: 10 pages (401-410)\n- Tens digit 1: 10 pages (411-420)\n- Tens digit 2: 10 pages (421-430)\n- Tens digit 3: 10 pages (431-440)\n- Tens digit 4: 10 pages (441-450)\n- Tens digit 5: 10 pages (451-460)\n- Tens digit 6: 10 pages (461-470)\n- Tens digit 7: 10 pages (471-480)\n- Tens digit 8: 8 pages (481-488)\n\nSo, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? It appears in the range 441-450, which is 10 times. Similarly, how many times does 8 appear? It's in the range 481-488, which is 8 times.\n\nWait, but the tens digit is 8 in 481-488, so that's 8 times. So in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in the tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 = 50.\n\nTotal 8's in the tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 8 = 48.\n\nSo, the difference in the tens place is 50 - 48 = 2 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nThe hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's see how many times each digit appears in the hundreds place.\n\nFrom 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, but since we start at 1, maybe it's better to consider 1-99 as having no hundreds digit, but when we get to 100, the hundreds digit becomes 1.\n\nWait, actually, for page numbers 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist; they are either one or two-digit numbers. So the hundreds digit is only present from page 100 onwards.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit cycles as follows:\n\n- 100-199: hundreds digit is 1 (100 times)\n- 200-299: hundreds digit is 2 (100 times)\n- 300-399: hundreds digit is 3 (100 times)\n- 400-488: hundreds digit is 4 (89 times, since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89)\n\nWait, 400-488 is 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n\nNow, we need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place.\n\nFirst, 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 times.\n\nWhat about 8? The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's in the hundreds place is 89, and the number of 8's is 0.\n\nSo, the difference in the hundreds place is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each digit place.\n\nUnits place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49 \u2192 difference 0\nTens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 48 \u2192 difference +2\nHundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0 \u2192 difference +89\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 2 + 89 = 91\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nTotal pages: 488\nNumber of complete tens: 48 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8)\nEach complete ten contributes 1 to 4's and 1 to 8's in the units place, so 48 each.\nRemaining 8 pages: 481-488. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So total units place: 48 +1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nComplete hundreds: 4 (1-400). Each hundred contributes 10 to 4's and 10 to 8's in the tens place. So 4*10=40 each.\nRemaining 88 pages: 401-488. As before, the tens digits are 0-8, with 8 appearing only 8 times (481-488). Wait, no, in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but we only go to 488). So in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50; 8's:40 +8=48. Correct. So difference here is +2.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 400-488, 89 pages, so hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. 8 never appears in hundreds place. So difference here is +89.\n\nAdding up: 0 (units) +2 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =91.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly.\n\nFrom 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so no contribution.\n100-199: hundreds digit 1, 100 times.\n200-299: hundreds digit 2, 100 times.\n300-399: hundreds digit 3, 100 times.\n400-488: hundreds digit 4, 89 times.\n\nSo yes, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and 8 never appears.\n\nWait, but let me check the total number of 4's and 8's to make sure I didn't overcount.\n\nTotal 4's:\n\nUnits:49\nTens:50\nHundreds:89\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:\n\nUnits:49\nTens:48\nHundreds:0\nTotal 8's:49+48=97\n\nDifference:188 -97=91\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but I just want to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the counts.\n\nLet me recount the hundreds place:\n\nFrom 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 -400 +1=89. So hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 pages. Correct.\n\nTens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 pages. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 4's and 8's each appear 49 times. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up, the difference is indeed 91.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - 488 pages mean 48 complete sets of 10 pages and 8 additional pages.\n   - In each set, '4' and '8' each appear once in the units place.\n   - Total for units place: 48 + 1 (from the last 8 pages) = 49 each.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - 488 pages include 4 complete hundreds (1-400) and 88 additional pages (401-488).\n   - In each hundred, '4' and '8' each appear 10 times in the tens place.\n   - For 401-488, '4' appears 10 times (441-450), and '8' appears 8 times (481-488).\n   - Total for tens place: 4*10 +10 =50 for '4', and 4*10 +8=48 for '8'.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - '4' appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 times.\n   - '8' never appears in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total for hundreds place: 89 for '4', 0 for '8'.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - '4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188\n   - '8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =97\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) -97 (8's) =91\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 91 more times than the digit '8'.  \n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand the problem clearly. Each page from 1 to 488 is numbered once, and I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nAlright, so the plan is to calculate the total number of 4's and 8's in all the page numbers and then find the difference. Let me break this down by considering each digit place separately: units place and tens place. I think this will make it easier to count without missing any numbers.\n\nLet's start with the digit 4.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - In every set of ten consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484.\n   - To find how many such sets there are in 488 pages, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives me 48.8. Since we can't have a fraction of a set, I'll take the integer part, which is 48 full sets. Each set contributes 1 '4' in the units place, so that's 48 times.\n   - But wait, the 48th set would end at 480, right? So from 481 to 488, that's 8 more numbers. In these, the units digit cycles from 1 to 8, so there's no 4 in the units place here. So, the total units place 4's are 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Now, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for an entire block of ten numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, etc.\n   - Each such block contributes 10 '4's in the tens place.\n   - Let me figure out how many such blocks there are in 488 pages.\n   - The first block is 40-49, the next is 140-149, then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks in total.\n   - So, each block contributes 10 '4's, so 5 blocks contribute 5 * 10 = 50 '4's in the tens place.\n   - But wait, let me check. The last block is 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's correct, 5 blocks each contributing 10 '4's.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Now, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - Let me calculate how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.\n   - Each of these numbers has a '4' in the hundreds place, so that's 89 '4's.\n\nWait, but hold on. I think I made a mistake here because the hundreds place '4's are only for numbers from 400 to 488, which is correct. So, the total '4's in the hundreds place is 89.\n\nWait, but let me check again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89 '4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the '4's:\n\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\n\nTotal '4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nWait, let me check the addition again: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. When I calculated the units place, I considered 48 sets of 10, each contributing one '4', so 48 '4's. But from 1 to 488, how many complete tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one '4' in the units place. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, each block of 100 has one block where the tens digit is '4', which is 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many such blocks are there?\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10\n- 240-249: 10\n- 340-349: 10\n- 440-449: 10\n\nThat's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 '4's in the tens place, so 50 '4's. That seems correct.\n\nAnd the hundreds place, as we saw, is 89 '4's.\n\nSo total '4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nWait, but let me check: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) = 98, plus 89 (hundreds) = 187. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit '8'.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to the '4's, in every set of ten numbers, the digit '8' appears once in the units place.\n   - So, from 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets of ten, each contributing one '8' in the units place, so 48 '8's.\n   - But wait, the last set is 481-490, but our book only goes up to 488, so from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, which includes an '8' in 488. So, that's one more '8' in the units place beyond the 48 sets. Wait, but 488 is included, so the units digit '8' occurs once more in 488. So, total units place '8's would be 48 (from the 48 sets) plus 1 more in 488, making it 49.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Each set of ten contributes one '8' in the units place. So, for 1-10, it's 8; 11-20, it's 18; and so on up to 480-489. But our book stops at 488, so the last set is 481-490, but we only go up to 488. So, in that last set, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, so that's one more '8' in the units place. So, total units place '8's would be 48 (from the 48 sets) plus 1, totaling 49.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Because each set of ten contributes one '8' in the units place, so 48 sets would give 48 '8's, but in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so that's one more '8' in 488. So, total units '8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Now, for the tens place, the digit '8' appears in blocks of ten numbers, like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.\n   - Each such block contributes 10 '8's in the tens place.\n   - Let's count how many such blocks are within 488.\n   - The first block is 80-89, then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.\n   - But 480-489 is within 488, so that's five blocks in total.\n   - Each block contributes 10 '8's, so 5 * 10 = 50 '8's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit '8' in the hundreds place would appear in numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no '8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up all the '8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 0\n\nTotal '8's = 49 + 50 = 99.\n\nWait, let me check the addition: 49 + 50 is indeed 99.\n\nWait, but hold on. Did I count the units place correctly? Let me make sure.\n\nEach set of ten numbers contributes one '8' in the units place, so 48 sets would give 48 '8's. Then, in the last set, 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, adding one more '8' in the units place. So, total units '8's are 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, each block of 100 has a block where the tens digit is '8', contributing 10 '8's. So, from 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-489. Since 480-489 is within 488, that's five blocks, each contributing 10 '8's, so 50 '8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, total '8's: 49 + 50 = 99.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more '4's are printed than '8's. So, I subtract the total number of '8's from the total number of '4's.\n\nTotal '4's: 187\n\nTotal '8's: 99\n\nDifference: 187 - 99 = 88.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for '4's:\n\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor '8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99. That also seems correct.\n\nDifference: 187 - 99 = 88.\n\nHmm, but wait a second. I think I might have made a mistake in counting the hundreds place '4's. Let me check that again.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a '4' in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place '4's, I had 5 blocks, each contributing 10 '4's, so 50. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place '4's: 48 sets of ten, each contributing one '4', so 48. Correct.\n\nSo, total '4's: 187.\n\nFor '8's:\n\nUnits place: 49, because 48 sets of ten give 48 '8's, plus one more in 488, making 49.\n\nTens place: 5 blocks, each contributing 10 '8's, so 50.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal '8's: 99.\n\nDifference: 187 - 99 = 88.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 88 seems like a big difference. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I overcounted the hundreds place '4's. Let me check: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a '4' in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nWait, but let me consider another approach. Maybe using a formula or a different counting method to verify.\n\nAnother way to count the number of times a digit appears is to consider each digit position separately and calculate how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor a 488-page book, the page numbers go from 001 to 488 if we consider three-digit numbers, but since pages start at 1, it's from 1 to 488.\n\nLet me consider each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both '4' and '8'.\n\n**Counting '4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - As before, in each block of 10 numbers, '4' appears once in the units place.\n   - Number of complete blocks of 10 in 488: floor(488 / 10) = 48 blocks.\n   - Each block contributes 1 '4', so 48 '4's.\n   - Now, check the remaining numbers: 488 - (48 * 10) = 488 - 480 = 8 numbers (481-488). In these, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so no additional '4's in the units place.\n   - So, total units '4's: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In each block of 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 ten times each.\n   - So, in each block of 100, '4' appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n   - Number of complete blocks of 100 in 488: floor(488 / 100) = 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400).\n   - Each block contributes 10 '4's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40 '4's.\n   - Now, check the remaining numbers: 488 - 400 = 88 numbers (401-488).\n   - In these 88 numbers, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 in the tens place.\n   - The tens digit '4' appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 more '4's in the tens place.\n   - So, total tens '4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is '4' for numbers from 400 to 488, inclusive.\n   - Number of such numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - So, 89 '4's in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal '4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting '8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - As before, each block of 10 contributes one '8' in the units place.\n   - Number of complete blocks: floor(488 / 10) = 48, contributing 48 '8's.\n   - Remaining numbers: 481-488, which includes 488, so one more '8' in the units place.\n   - Total units '8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each block of 100 contributes one block where the tens digit is '8', each contributing 10 '8's.\n   - Number of complete blocks of 100: 4, so 4 * 10 = 40 '8's.\n   - Remaining numbers: 401-488, which includes 480-488.\n   - In 480-488, the tens digit is '8' for 10 numbers (480-489), but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers? Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is '8' for all of them, right? Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so that's 9 numbers. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is '8' for all of them, so that's 9 '8's in the tens place. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 10, but since 488 is included, it's 9 numbers from 480 to 488, inclusive.\n\nWait, no, 480 is the first number, then 481, ..., up to 488. That's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is '8' in all of them. So, that's 9 '8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 10 '8's, but now I'm getting 9. Hmm, this discrepancy needs to be resolved.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The tens digit is '8' in 480-489, which is 10 numbers. But since our book ends at 488, we only have 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit '8' appears 9 times in the tens place in the remaining numbers.\n\nTherefore, the total tens '8's would be 40 (from the 4 blocks of 100) plus 9 (from 480-488), totaling 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 50 because I considered 5 blocks, each contributing 10 '8's. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake there.\n\nWait, let me recast this. The blocks where the tens digit is '8' are:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-489: 10\n\nBut our book ends at 488, so the last block is only up to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the fifth block contributes 9.\n\nSo, total tens '8's: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, perhaps I overcounted the tens '8's earlier.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\n- 80-89: 10 '8's in tens place\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9\n\nSo, total tens '8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, that's correct. Therefore, the total '8's in the tens place is 49, not 50 as I previously thought.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 50 because I considered 5 blocks, each contributing 10 '8's, but in reality, the last block only contributes 9 '8's because the book ends at 488. So, the correct count is 49.\n\nWait, but then I have to adjust the total '8's accordingly.\n\nSo, let's recalculate the '8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\n\nTotal '8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that's different from my previous count of 99. So, I must have made a mistake earlier by assuming the last block contributed 10 '8's, but it actually contributed 9.\n\nWait, let me double-check.\n\nIn the tens place, each block of 100 contributes a block where the tens digit is '8', which is 10 numbers. So, from 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contributes 10 '8's. However, the last such block is 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, the last block contributes 9 '8's instead of 10.\n\nTherefore, the total '8's in the tens place are 4 blocks contributing 10 each (40) plus 1 block contributing 9, totaling 49.\n\nSo, total '8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\n\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, so now the total '8's are 98, not 99 as I previously thought. So, the difference would be 187 (total '4's) - 98 (total '8's) = 89.\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because earlier I thought the tens place '8's were 50, making total '8's 99, but now I'm getting 49 in tens place, making total '8's 98.\n\nLet me go through this again carefully.\n\n**Counting '8's in the tens place:**\n\n- The blocks where the tens digit is '8' are:\n\n1. 80-89: 10 numbers, all within 488. So, 10 '8's.\n2. 180-189: 10 numbers, within 488. 10 '8's.\n3. 280-289: 10 numbers, within 488. 10 '8's.\n4. 380-389: 10 numbers, within 488. 10 '8's.\n5. 480-488: 9 numbers, since 488 is the last page. So, 9 '8's.\n\nSo, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 '8's in the tens place.\n\nTherefore, the total '8's are:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\n\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the total '8's are 98, and total '4's are 187.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference was 88, but now it's 89. So, which one is correct?\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether the last block of tens '8's contributes 9 or 10. Since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 '8's in the tens place.\n\nTherefore, total '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nThus, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me check once more to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the tens digit '8' in 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 '8's, making the total tens '8's 49, as above.\n\nSo, the correct total '8's are 98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I'm now getting two different results depending on how I count the tens '8's. This is concerning.\n\nLet me try another approach: using the formula for digit counting.\n\nThe formula to calculate the number of times a digit 'd' appears from 1 to n is as follows:\n\nFor each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), we can calculate the number of times 'd' appears.\n\nLet me apply this formula for both '4' and '8'.\n\n**Calculating '4's:**\n\nLet's consider each digit position.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - n = 488\n   - We can use the formula: (n // 10) * 1 + min(max(n % 10 - 4 + 1, 0), 1)\n   - Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of higher digits and lower digits.\n\nWait, maybe it's getting too complicated. Alternatively, I can use the approach where for each digit position, I calculate how many times '4' appears.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to stick with my initial counting, but make sure it's accurate.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units place '8's. Let me recount.\n\n**Units place '8's:**\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many numbers have '8' in the units place?\n\nEach block of 10 numbers contributes one '8' in the units place. So, 488 // 10 = 48 full blocks, each contributing one '8', so 48 '8's.\n\nNow, the last partial block is 481-488, which includes 488, so the units digit '8' occurs once more in 488.\n\nTherefore, total units '8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\n**Tens place '8's:**\n\nAs before, the blocks where the tens digit is '8' are:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 numbers\n\nSo, total tens '8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n**Hundreds place '8's:**\n\nNone, since 488 < 800.\n\nTherefore, total '8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, total '4's: 187, total '8's: 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference was 88, but now it's 89. So, which is correct?\n\nI think the correct difference is 89, because the tens place '8's are 49, not 50, due to the last block ending at 488.\n\nWait, let me check with a smaller example to see if my counting is correct.\n\nSuppose I have a book with 488 pages, but let's take a smaller number, say 50 pages, and see how many '4's and '8's there are.\n\nFor 50 pages:\n\n- '4's:\n\n  - Units place: 4,14,24,34,44 \u2192 5 '4's\n  - Tens place: 40-49 \u2192 10 '4's\n  - Hundreds place: 0\n  - Total '4's: 5 + 10 = 15\n\n- '8's:\n\n  - Units place: 8,18,28,38,48 \u2192 5 '8's\n  - Tens place: 40-49: no, wait, 80-89 would be beyond 50. So, in 1-50, the tens place '8's are in 40-49? Wait, no, 40-49 has tens digit '4', not '8'. So, in 1-50, the tens digit '8' would be in 80-89, which is beyond 50, so no '8's in the tens place.\n  - So, total '8's: 5 (units) + 0 (tens) = 5.\n\nDifference: 15 - 5 = 10.\n\nBut according to my earlier method:\n\n- Units '8's: floor(50/10) = 5, plus if the last partial block has an '8', which it does (48), so 5 + 1 = 6? Wait, but in 50 pages, the units '8's are 8,18,28,38,48, which is 5, not 6. So, my formula was wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is: units '8's = floor(n / 10) + (1 if (n % 10) >= 8 else 0). So, for n=50, floor(50/10)=5, and 50%10=0, which is less than 8, so units '8's=5.\n\nSimilarly, for n=488, units '8's= floor(488/10)=48, and 488%10=8, which is equal to 8, so we add 1, making it 49.\n\nSo, the formula is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place '8's:\n\nIn 1-50, the tens digit '8's would be in 80-89, which is beyond 50, so 0.\n\nIn 1-50, the tens '8's=0.\n\nSo, in 1-50, total '8's=5.\n\nIn my earlier counting, for 50 pages, '4's=15, '8's=5, difference=10.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nSimilarly, for 488 pages:\n\n- Units '8's: floor(488/10)=48, and since 488%10=8, we add 1, so 49.\n- Tens '8's: For each block of 100, the tens digit '8's occur once per block, contributing 10 '8's. So, how many complete blocks of 100 are there? floor(488/100)=4, so 4 blocks, each contributing 10 '8's, so 40 '8's. Now, the remaining numbers are 488 - 400=88, so from 401-488. In these, the tens digit '8' occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 '8's. So, total tens '8's=40 + 9=49.\n\nSo, total '8's=49 (units) + 49 (tens)=98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 187 - 98=89.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 88. So, I must have made a mistake in the tens place '8's earlier by assuming 5 blocks contributing 10 each, but in reality, the last block only contributes 9 '8's.\n\nTherefore, the correct difference is 89.\n\nWait, but let me check once more.\n\nWait, in the tens place, the blocks are:\n\n1. 80-89: 10 '8's\n2. 180-189: 10\n3. 280-289:10\n4. 380-389:10\n5. 480-488:9\n\nTotal: 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, total '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens)=98.\n\nTotal '4's:187.\n\nDifference:187-98=89.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 89.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure because earlier I thought it was 88. Let me try another approach: writing a small program or using a different counting method.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the hundreds place '4's are 89, which is correct because from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers.\n\nNow, the tens place '4's: in each hundred, the tens digit '4' appears in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, in 1-400, how many such blocks are there? 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 '4's, so 4*10=40 '4's.\n\nThen, in 401-488, the tens digit '4' appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 '4's.\n\nThus, total tens '4's:40+10=50.\n\nUnits '4's: floor(488/10)=48, and since 488%10=8, which is >=4, we add 1 more '4' in the units place? Wait, no, the formula is to add 1 only if the remainder is >= the digit. So, for '4's, if the units digit is >=4, we add 1. Since 488%10=8, which is >=4, so units '4's=48+1=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units '4's were 48. Hmm, this is conflicting.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nThe formula for units digit 'd' is:\n\nunits_count = (n // 10) * 1\n\nif (n % 10) >= d:\n    units_count += 1\n\nSo, for '4's:\n\nn=488\n\nunits_count = (488 // 10) = 48\n\nsince 488%10=8 >=4, units_count +=1 \u2192 49.\n\nSimilarly, for '8's:\n\nunits_count = 488//10=48\n\nsince 488%10=8 >=8, units_count +=1 \u219249.\n\nSo, this suggests that units '4's are 49, not 48 as I previously thought.\n\nWait, this changes everything.\n\nWait, so if units '4's are 49, then total '4's would be:\n\nunits:49\n\ntens:50\n\nhundreds:89\n\nTotal:49+50+89=188.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units '4's were 48, but according to this formula, it's 49.\n\nWait, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier by not considering that the last partial block contributes an additional '4' in the units place.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many '4's are in the units place?\n\nEach block of 10 contributes one '4', so 48 blocks give 48 '4's.\n\nNow, the last"

After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering how digits are structured in page numbers. Page numbers can be one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit numbers. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488, which is a three-digit number.\n\nI'll tackle each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place.\n   - From page 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, we'll take the integer part, which is 48 times. Wait, but actually, from 1 to 488, the last block ends at 488, so the number of complete blocks is 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8). So, 48 times in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so in the units place, the 48th block would be 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the 4 in the units place appears 48 times because 488 is included, right? Wait, no, 488 is the last page, so the units digit cycles up to 8 in the last block. So, in each block of 10, 4 appears once in the units place, and there are 48 full blocks (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks). So, 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers: 40-49.\n   - So, in each block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n   - Since we have 488 pages, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages from 401-488.\n   - In each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 times.\n   - Now, in the last partial block (401-488), the tens digit is 0 for 401-409, 1 for 410-419, and so on. The tens digit 4 would appear in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 488 is less than 499, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488. So, that's another 10 times.\n   - Wait, no, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 more times.\n   - So, total in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages.\n   - The number of pages from 400 to 488 is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up the occurrences of 4:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the units place. Let's recount.\n\nUnits place: For each 10 numbers, 4 appears once. From 1 to 488, how many 4's in units place?\n\nNumber of complete decades: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8). So, 48 times, but wait, the 48th decade is 481-490, but we only go up to 488, so in that last partial decade, 481-488, the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, 48 complete decades give 48, and the last partial decade adds 1 more. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that's different from my initial count. So, I think I was wrong before. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, units place: 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place: from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nEach hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 1-100: 40-49 \u2192 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, 101-200: 140-149 \u2192 10 times.\n\n201-300: 240-249 \u2192 10 times.\n\n301-400: 340-349 \u2192 10 times.\n\n401-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 times.\n\nSo, that's 5 sets of 10, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n\nWait, but 401-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 50 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nWait, that's different from my first count. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by not considering the partial decade in the units place.\n\nNow, let's check for the digit 8.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\nSimilarly, I'll check each digit place.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - In each block of 10, the digit 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete decades and a partial one.\n   - So, 48 \u00d7 1 = 48, and in the last partial decade (481-488), 488 is included, so units digit 8 appears once (488).\n   - So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In each block of 100, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - From 1-488, how many such blocks?\n   - Let's see: 1-100: 80-89 \u2192 10 times.\n   - 101-200: 180-189 \u2192 10 times.\n   - 201-300: 280-289 \u2192 10 times.\n   - 301-400: 380-389 \u2192 10 times.\n   - 401-488: 480-488. Here, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 times, not 10.\n   - So, total tens place 8's: 4 \u00d7 10 (from the first four hundreds) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 401-488, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488). So, 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only in pages 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8.\n   - So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of 8's is 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 complete decades (1-480) give 48 4's, and then in 481-488, 484 is the only one, so 49 total.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred has 10 4's in the tens place. From 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, 401-488 includes 440-449, which is another 10, so 50 total.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 4's.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, for the 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 complete decades (1-480) give 48 8's, and 488 adds one more, so 49.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred up to 400 contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, 401-488 includes 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place, making total 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I didn't overcount somewhere. For example, in the tens place for 4's, from 401-488, is 440-449 entirely within 401-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place there.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** In every block of 10 numbers, '4' appears once. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete blocks of 10, contributing 48 '4's. The last partial block (481-488) adds one more '4' (at 484), totaling 49.\n   - **Tens place:** In every block of 100 numbers, '4' appears 10 times in the tens place. From 1 to 400, there are four such blocks, contributing 40 '4's. The last partial block (401-488) includes 440-449, adding 10 more, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is '4' for 89 numbers.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to '4', there are 48 complete blocks of 10, contributing 48 '8's. The last partial block adds one more at 488, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens place:** In each block of 100, '8' appears 10 times. From 1 to 400, this contributes 40 '8's. The last partial block (401-488) includes 480-488, contributing 9 '8's, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No '8's appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' appears 90 times more than the digit '8' in the page numbers.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488, and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488, which is a three-digit number. So, I'll need to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nI remember that to count the number of times a particular digit appears in a range of numbers, it's helpful to look at each digit position individually. So, I'll tackle the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place separately for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nLet's start with the digit 4.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - In the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place.\n   - How many such blocks are there up to 488?\n   - Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and an extra 8 numbers (481-488).\n   - So, in each block, there's one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 * 1 = 48.\n   - Now, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (484).\n   - So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers, specifically from x40 to x49, where x is the hundreds digit.\n   - For each hundred block (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n   - How many such blocks are there up to 488?\n   - The hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. But wait, since we're starting from page 1, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, and so on up to 4 for 400-488.\n   - So, the hundreds digit is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. That's 5 blocks.\n   - For each block, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 * 10 = 50.\n   - Wait, but the last block is 400-488. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's fine.\n   - So, total 4's in the tens place: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488.\n   - How many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers.\n   - Therefore, 89 occurrences of the digit 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, actually, in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4, which is correct. So, 89 times.\n\nIn the tens place, for each hundred block, we have 10 numbers with tens digit 4, and there are 5 hundred blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). But wait, the last block is only up to 488, so does that affect the tens digit? Let me see.\n\nIn the 400-488 block, the tens digit goes up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 in the 400-488 block. Therefore, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 10 numbers, same as other blocks. So, 5 blocks * 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n\nIn the units place, 48 full tens blocks (1-480) give 48 4's, and then 481-488 gives one more 4 in the units place (484). So, 49 total. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, in the units place, 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total number of full tens blocks up to 488: 48 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8).\n   - Each block contributes one 8 in the units place, so 48 * 1 = 48.\n   - In the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (488).\n   - So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In the tens place, 8 appears in blocks like x80 to x89, where x is the hundreds digit.\n   - Each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8.\n   - How many hundred blocks are there up to 488?\n   - The hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 5 blocks.\n   - For each block, 10 numbers with tens digit 8. So, 5 * 10 = 50.\n   - However, in the last block (400-488), the tens digit goes up to 8, so 480-488 is part of this. So, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, that's 9 numbers, not 10. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me correct that.\n\nIn the tens place, for each hundred block, the tens digit 8 appears from x80 to x89, which is 10 numbers. However, in the last block (400-488), the tens digit can only go up to 8, but the units digit can only go up to 8, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in this case, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the last block, not 10.\n\nTherefore, for the tens place:\n\n- For the first four hundred blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributes 10 8's in the tens place. That's 4 * 10 = 40.\n- For the last block (400-488), the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 8's.\n- So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 50. Let me verify.\n\nWait, actually, the hundreds blocks are 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488.\n\nSo, in each of the first four blocks, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nIn the last block, 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9.\n\nTotal tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8.\n   - Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems a bit low. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, in the units place, we have 49 8's, correct. In the tens place, 49, correct. Hundreds place, 0, correct. So total 98.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. For the first four hundred blocks, 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each has 10 8's in the tens place, so 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier when counting 4's, I got 188, and for 8's, 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check that again.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 4's. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for each hundred block, 10 4's, and there are 5 hundred blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but in the 400-488 block, the tens digit goes up to 8, so the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's fine. So, 5 blocks * 10 = 50. Correct.\n\nIn the units place, 48 full tens blocks give 48 4's, and the last partial block (481-488) gives one more 4 (484). So, 49. Correct.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens blocks give 48 8's, and the last partial block (481-488) gives one more 8 (488). So, 49.\n\nTens place: 4 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) give 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can use a formula or a different counting method to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as for each digit position, how many times does 4 appear minus how many times 8 appears.\n\nSo, for units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) + (if the last partial block has a 4, add 1). So, floor(488/10)=48, and 488 mod 10 is 8, which is less than 4? No, wait, 4 is less than 8, so we have to check if the last partial block (481-488) includes a 4 in the units place, which is 484. So, yes, add 1. So, units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: floor(488/10)=48, and 488 mod 10 is 8, which is equal to 8, so add 1. So, 48 +1=49.\n\nSo, units place: 4's - 8's = 49 - 49 = 0.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100)*10 + extra. Wait, let's think.\n\nIn the tens place, the number of times 4 appears is calculated as:\n\nFor each hundred block, the tens digit cycles 0-9, so 4 appears 10 times per hundred.\n\nNumber of complete hundreds: floor(488/100)=4 (since 4*100=400). So, 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place: 4*10=40.\n\nThen, in the incomplete hundred (400-488), the tens digit goes up to 8, so we check how many times 4 appears in the tens place in 400-488.\n\nFrom 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, add 10.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds: floor(488/100)=4. Each contributes 10 8's in the tens place: 4*10=40.\n\nIn the incomplete hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, add 9.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 +9=49.\n\nSo, tens place: 4's - 8's =50 -49=1.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nNumber of 8's: 0, since the book doesn't reach 800.\n\nSo, hundreds place: 4's -8's=89 -0=89.\n\nNow, total difference: units (0) + tens (1) + hundreds (89)=90.\n\nSo, that confirms the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference was 90, and this method also gives 90. So, that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488 and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by understanding the structure of page numbers. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488, which is a three-digit number. So, I should consider all three-digit numbers, but I have to remember that the first page is 1, which is a single-digit number, and the last page is 488.\n\nI think the best way is to break down the counting based on the number of digits: single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit page numbers. Maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\nLet's start with the single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digits 4 and 8 each appear once. So, for single-digit pages, both 4 and 8 occur once. So, the count so far is 1 for 4 and 1 for 8.\n\nNow, moving on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nStarting with the units place for two-digit numbers. For each ten (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears once. There are 9 sets of ten in the two-digit numbers (10-99), so for the units place, 4 appears 9 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nNow, for the tens place in two-digit numbers. The tens digit can be from 1 to 9. For each tens digit, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, for the tens place, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for the numbers 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 80-89, which is also 10 times.\n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, the total count for 4's is 9 (units) + 10 (tens) = 19. Similarly, for 8's, it's 9 (units) + 10 (tens) = 19.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me double-check. For units place, each ten has one 4 and one 8, so 9 tens would give 9 each. For tens place, each digit from 1-9 appears 10 times in the tens place, so 4 and 8 each appear 10 times. So yes, 19 each for two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, adding this to the single-digit counts: 4's total so far is 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) = 20. Similarly, 8's total is 1 + 19 = 20.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, but since the book ends at 488, when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens and units digits are limited.\n\nI think I should break this down into hundreds, tens, and units places separately.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n- For hundreds digit 1: The numbers range from 100 to 199. Here, the hundreds digit is 1, so 4 and 8 don't appear in the hundreds place. So, 0 counts for both.\n- Similarly, for hundreds digit 2: 200-299. Again, hundreds digit is 2, so 0 counts for both.\n- For hundreds digit 3: 300-399. Hundreds digit is 3, so 0 counts for both.\n- For hundreds digit 4: 400-488. Here, the hundreds digit is 4, so every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place for three-digit numbers. The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place here because the hundreds digit is 4, so 0 counts for 8.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place for three-digit numbers, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNext, the tens place for three-digit numbers. Let's consider each hundreds group separately.\n\n- For hundreds digit 1 (100-199): The tens digit can be 0-9, and for each tens digit, the units digit cycles 0-9. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 and 8 appear?\n\nFor each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each (since for each tens digit, there are 10 units digits). So, for each hundreds group, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and similarly, 8 appears 10 times.\n\nBut wait, for the hundreds group 400-488, the tens digit doesn't go up to 9 because the last page is 488. So, in 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for the hundreds group 400-488, the tens digit cycles 0-8, each appearing 10 times except maybe the last one? Wait, let's think.\n\nWait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 0 for 400-409, 1 for 410-419, and so on up to 8 for 480-488. So, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except the last one, which is only 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in this case, not 10.\n\nWait, let me clarify. For each tens digit from 0 to 7, there are 10 numbers each (e.g., 400-409 is 10 numbers, so tens digit 0 appears 10 times). But for the tens digit 8, it's only from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers, so tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, for the hundreds group 400-488, in the tens place:\n\n- Tens digits 0-7: each appears 10 times\n- Tens digit 8: appears 9 times\n- Tens digit 9: doesn't appear because the last page is 488.\n\nSo, for the tens place in 400-488:\n\n- 4 appears in the tens place when the tens digit is 4, which would be from 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n- Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place when the tens digit is 8, which is 480-488, which is 9 times.\n\nWait, but I'm supposed to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place across all three-digit numbers. So, let's break it down for each hundreds group:\n\n1. Hundreds group 100-199:\n   - Tens digit cycles 0-9, each appearing 10 times.\n   - So, 4 appears 10 times in tens place.\n   - 8 appears 10 times in tens place.\n\n2. Hundreds group 200-299:\n   - Same as above, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\n3. Hundreds group 300-399:\n   - Same, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\n4. Hundreds group 400-488:\n   - Tens digits 0-7: each appears 10 times, so 4 appears 10 times (tens digit 4) and 8 appears 10 times (tens digit 8? Wait, no, because in 400-488, tens digit 8 only appears 9 times because 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, 400-409: tens digit 0, 10 numbers.\n410-419: tens digit 1, 10 numbers.\n...\n470-479: tens digit 7, 10 numbers.\n480-488: tens digit 8, 9 numbers.\n\nSo, in the tens place for 400-488:\n\n- 4 appears when tens digit is 4: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n- 8 appears when tens digit is 8: 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo, for the hundreds group 400-488, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the hundreds groups for the tens place:\n\n- For 4: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 times.\n- For 8: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me check again. Each hundreds group except 400-488 contributes 10 each for 4 and 8 in the tens place. The 400-488 group contributes 10 for 4 and 9 for 8 in the tens place. So, total 40 for 4 and 39 for 8 in the tens place across all three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place for three-digit numbers. Again, I'll consider each hundreds group separately.\n\n1. Hundreds group 100-199:\n   - For each tens digit (0-9), the units digit cycles 0-9, so in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and 8 appears once.\n   - There are 10 tens digits (0-9), so for units place, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\n2. Hundreds group 200-299:\n   - Same as above, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\n3. Hundreds group 300-399:\n   - Same, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\n4. Hundreds group 400-488:\n   - Here, the units digit cycles from 0-9 for each tens digit, except for the last tens digit, which is 8 (480-488), where the units digit goes up to 8.\n\nWait, no, actually, for each tens digit in 400-488, the units digit cycles from 0-9 except when the tens digit is 8, where it only goes up to 8 (since the last page is 488). So, let me think:\n\n- For tens digits 0-7 in 400-488:\n   - Each has units digits 0-9, so for each of these tens digits, 4 appears once in units place, and 8 appears once.\n   - There are 8 tens digits (0-7), so 8 times 4 appears and 8 times 8 appears.\n\n- For tens digit 8 (480-488):\n   - Units digits go from 0-8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). Wait, but 484 is within 480-488, so yes, 4 appears once, and 8 appears once.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, for units digits, 0-8. So, in this case, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, for the tens digit 8, units digits 0-8, so 4 appears once and 8 appears once.\n\nSo, for the units place in 400-488:\n\n- Tens digits 0-7: each contributes 1 for 4 and 1 for 8, so 8 * 1 = 8 each.\n- Tens digit 8: contributes 1 for 4 and 1 for 8.\n- So, total for 400-488 in units place: 8 + 1 = 9 for 4, and 8 + 1 = 9 for 8.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. For each tens digit from 0-7, the units digits go from 0-9, so each tens group contributes 1 for 4 and 1 for 8 in the units place. So, 8 tens digits contribute 8 each for 4 and 8. Then, for tens digit 8, units digits go from 0-8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, adding 1 each, making total for 400-488 in units place: 8 + 1 = 9 for 4 and 8 + 1 = 9 for 8.\n\nWait, but that would mean that in the units place for 400-488, both 4 and 8 appear 9 times. But wait, let me think: for each of the 8 tens digits (0-7), units digits 0-9, so 10 numbers each, so 4 appears once per tens digit, so 8 times. Then, for tens digit 8, units digits 0-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total for 400-488 in units place: 8 + 1 = 9 for 4 and 8 + 1 = 9 for 8.\n\nSo, for the units place across all three-digit numbers:\n\n- 100-199: 10 for 4, 10 for 8\n- 200-299: 10 for 4, 10 for 8\n- 300-399: 10 for 4, 10 for 8\n- 400-488: 9 for 4, 9 for 8\n\nSo, total units place counts:\n\n- 4: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n- 8: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n\nWait, that seems correct? Each hundreds group except 400-488 contributes 10 each, and 400-488 contributes 9 each, so total 39 each.\n\nWait, but let me check: for 400-488, in the units place, how many times does 4 and 8 appear? For each tens digit 0-7, 4 appears once, so 8 times. Then, for tens digit 8, 4 appears once at 484, so total 9. Similarly for 8, it's 8 times from tens 0-7, and once at 488, so total 9. So yes, 39 each.\n\nNow, let's sum up the three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n- Tens place: 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n- Units place: 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\nSo, total for three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 89 + 40 = 129 + 39 = 168\n- 8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nWait, let me check that calculation again.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nTens place: 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\nUnits place: 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\nSo, total for 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 89 + 40 is 129, plus 39 is 168.\n\nTotal for 8's in three-digit numbers: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's add up all the counts from single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 = 20 + 168 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 = 20 + 78 = 98\n\nWait, so total 4's are 188 and total 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, single-digit: 1 for both 4 and 8.\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- Units place: 9 each\n- Tens place: 10 each\nTotal: 19 each.\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0\n- Tens place: 4 appears 40, 8 appears 39\n- Units place: 4 appears 39, 8 appears 39\nTotal for 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\nTotal for 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nAdding single and two-digit:\n\n4's: 1 + 19 = 20 + 168 = 188\n\n8's: 1 + 19 = 20 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in three-digit numbers, especially in the tens and units places.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 in hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for each hundreds group except 400-488, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. For 400-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, 10 + 10 + 10 + (10 + 9) for 4's? Wait, no, wait:\n\nWait, no, for the tens place across all three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds group 100-199: 10 for 4, 10 for 8\n- 200-299: same\n- 300-399: same\n- 400-488: 10 for 4, 9 for 8\n\nSo, total tens place for 4's: 10 * 3 + 10 = 40\nTotal tens place for 8's: 10 * 3 + 9 = 39\n\nThat's correct.\n\nIn the units place:\n\n- Each hundreds group except 400-488 contributes 10 for 4 and 10 for 8.\n- 400-488 contributes 9 for both 4 and 8.\n\nSo, units place:\n\n4's: 10 * 3 + 9 = 39\n8's: 10 * 3 + 9 = 39\n\nThat's correct.\n\nSo, three-digit counts:\n\n4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\n8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n\nAdding single and two-digit:\n\n4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a way to cross-validate this? Maybe by considering that from 1 to 488, each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) should have a certain number of each digit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each place.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the units place?\n\nIn each block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles 0-9, so each digit appears once per block.\n\nTotal number of complete blocks of 10 in 488 numbers: 48 full blocks (1-480) and 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n\nIn each block, 4 appears once and 8 appears once in the units place.\n\nSo, for 48 blocks, 48 * 1 = 48 times for 4, and 48 * 1 = 48 times for 8.\n\nNow, the extra 8 numbers: 481-488.\n\nIn the units place, 481 has 1, 482 has 2, ..., 488 has 8.\n\nSo, in the units place, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n\nSo, total units place:\n\n4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\nWait, but earlier I had 39 for 4's in units place for three-digit numbers, but that was only for three-digit numbers. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier by separating single and two-digit numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently, by considering all numbers from 1 to 488, and count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nTotal numbers: 488.\n\nLet's consider each digit place: units, tens, hundreds.\n\n1. Units place:\n\nAs above, in each block of 10, 4 and 8 appear once. There are 48 complete blocks (1-480), each contributing 1 for 4 and 1 for 8. Then, in 481-488, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place:\n\n4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. Tens place:\n\nIn each block of 100, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, for each block of 100, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nFrom 1-488, we have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more numbers (401-488).\n\nWait, no, 488 is less than 500, so it's 4 complete hundreds (1-400) and then 88 numbers (401-488).\n\nWait, but 400 is included in the hundreds, so 1-400 is 400 numbers, and 401-488 is 88 numbers.\n\nSo, for the tens place:\n\n- In 1-400, each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place (since 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times per digit). Wait, no: each hundred has 10 tens digits, each appearing 10 times. So, for 4 hundreds, each digit appears 4 * 10 = 40 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but that's only up to 400. Then, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last number). Let's see:\n\nFrom 401-488:\n\n- Tens digits are 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., 8 (481-488).\n\nBut wait, 401-410 is 10 numbers, so tens digit 0 appears 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, 411-420: tens digit 1, 10 times.\n\n...\n\n481-488: tens digit 8, 8 numbers (since 481-488 is 8 numbers, not 10).\n\nWait, but 481-488 is 8 numbers, so tens digit 8 appears 8 times? Wait, 481-488 is 8 numbers: 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, yes, 8 times.\n\nSo, in 401-488, the tens digits:\n\n- 0: 10 times (401-410)\n- 1: 10 times (411-420)\n- 2: 10 times (421-430)\n- 3: 10 times (431-440)\n- 4: 10 times (441-450)\n- 5: 10 times (451-460)\n- 6: 10 times (461-470)\n- 7: 10 times (471-480)\n- 8: 8 times (481-488)\n\nSo, for the tens place in 401-488:\n\n- 4 appears 10 times (tens digit 4)\n- 8 appears 8 times (tens digit 8)\n\nSo, total tens place counts:\n\n- 4's: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50\n- 8's: 40 (from 1-400) + 8 (from 401-488) = 48\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier calculation where I had 40 for 4's and 39 for 8's in the tens place. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, so according to this approach:\n\n- Units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49\n- Tens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 48\n- Hundreds place: Let's calculate that.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, so no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, so no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so 4 appears 89 times (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers). 8's don't appear in the hundreds place here.\n\nSo, hundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nNow, summing up all places:\n\n- Units: 4's = 49, 8's = 49\n- Tens: 4's = 50, 8's = 48\n- Hundreds: 4's = 89, 8's = 0\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 49 + 50 = 99 + 89 = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nWait, but earlier I had 98 for 8's. Hmm, there's a discrepancy here. Let me check where I went wrong.\n\nWait, in the tens place, when I considered 401-488, I said that 8 appears 8 times in the tens place, but in the previous approach, I had 39 for 8's in the tens place across all three-digit numbers, which included 400-488. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up approaches.\n\nWait, let me clarify. In the initial approach, I broke down three-digit numbers into hundreds, tens, and units, but perhaps that was more complicated. The second approach, considering all numbers from 1-488 and counting each digit place separately, seems more straightforward and less error-prone.\n\nSo, let's stick with the second approach:\n\n- Units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49\n- Tens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 48\n- Hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nSo, difference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but this contradicts my earlier result of 90. Hmm, I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let's check the tens place again.\n\nIn the tens place, from 1-400, each digit 0-9 appears 40 times (since 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times per digit). So, 40 times for each digit, including 4 and 8.\n\nThen, from 401-488, the tens digits:\n\n- 0: 10 times (401-410)\n- 1: 10 times (411-420)\n- 2: 10 times (421-430)\n- 3: 10 times (431-440)\n- 4: 10 times (441-450)\n- 5: 10 times (451-460)\n- 6: 10 times (461-470)\n- 7: 10 times (471-480)\n- 8: 8 times (481-488)\n\nSo, for 4's in tens place in 401-488: 10 times\nFor 8's in tens place in 401-488: 8 times\n\nSo, total tens place:\n\n4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n8's: 40 + 8 = 48\n\nThat's correct.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFrom 1-488, as calculated earlier, 4's = 49, 8's = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's: 89 (400-488)\n8's: 0\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nWait, but earlier I had 90. So, which one is correct?\n\nI think the error was in the initial approach where I considered three-digit numbers separately, perhaps miscalculating the units place in 400-488.\n\nWait, in the initial approach, for three-digit numbers, I had:\n\n- Units place: 39 for 4's and 39 for 8's\n- Tens place: 40 for 4's and 39 for 8's\n- Hundreds place: 89 for 4's and 0 for 8's\n\nSo, total for three-digit numbers: 168 for 4's and 78 for 8's.\n\nThen, adding single and two-digit:\n\n4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 90\n\nBut in the second approach, considering all numbers up to 488, I get 188 for 4's and 97 for 8's, difference 91.\n\nSo, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps in the initial approach, I made a mistake in the units place for three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, in the initial approach, I considered that in 400-488, the units place for 4's was 9 times, but according to the second approach, it's 9 times for 4's and 9 times for 8's in the units place for 400-488, but when considering all numbers up to 488, it's 49 each for 4 and 8 in the units place.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is arising because in the initial approach, I was separating single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers, but in the second approach, I'm considering all numbers together.\n\nLet me try to reconcile both approaches.\n\nIn the initial approach, for three-digit numbers, I had:\n\n- Units place: 39 for 4's and 39 for 8's\n- Tens place: 40 for 4's and 39 for 8's\n- Hundreds place: 89 for 4's and 0 for 8's\n\nSo, total three-digit counts"

    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488. Then, I'll do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by considering how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, I need to count the occurrences of 4 and 8 in the units place, tens place, and hundreds place separately.\n\nI'll start by counting the number of 4's. \n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide 488 by 10 and take the integer part. 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so there are 48 occurrences. But wait, does 488 include a 4 in the units place? The last page is 488, which ends with 8, so the last 4 in the units place is 484. So yes, 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. In each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40. But wait, the last block is 401-488, which includes 40-49 in the hundreds place, so that's another 10. So total 40 + 10 = 50? Wait, no, because 401-488 is part of the 400s, so the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So maybe 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40, but the 400s include 440-449, which is 10 more, so total 40 + 10 = 50? Hmm, but wait, the 400s go up to 488, so from 400 to 488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times. So the total for tens place is 40 + 10 = 50? Wait, no, because in each hundred, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times. So 4 hundreds would give 4\u00d710=40, and then in the 400s, we have another 10 from 440-449, but wait, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10, so total would be 40 + 10 = 50. But wait, 488 is less than 500, so the 400s go up to 488, so the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times. So total tens place 4's are 4\u00d710 +10=50? Wait, but 4 hundreds would be 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each has 10 4's in the tens place, so 4\u00d710=40. Then in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is another 10. So total 40 +10=50. So 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So 89 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So 187 4's.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place. Wait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct. Units place: 48 times, tens place: 50 times, hundreds place: 89 times. Total 4's: 48+50+89=187.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So 488 \u00f710=48.8, so 48 times. But wait, does 488 end with 8, so the last occurrence is 488. So yes, 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. So how many complete hundreds are there? From 1-488, we have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, in the 400s, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So that's 9 more. So total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800 onwards, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48+49=97.\n\nWait, so the number of 4's is 187 and the number of 8's is 97. So the difference is 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. The last one is 484, which is 484 = 4 + 10*(n-1), so n = (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Wait, so that's 49 times, not 48. So I think I made a mistake earlier. It should be 49 units place 4's.\n\nWait, but 488 \u00f710=48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, the last 4 in units place is 484, which is the 48th occurrence. Wait, 4,14,24,...,484: that's 48 numbers because 484 is the 48th term. So 48 times. So my initial count was correct.\n\nWait, but when I thought about it, 488 \u00f710=48.8, so 48 full cycles, so 48 4's in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, 4's:\n\nFrom 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So that's 5 blocks, each with 10 4's, so 5\u00d710=50. But wait, from 1-488, how many such blocks are there?\n\nWait, 40-49 is in 1-100, 140-149 in 101-200, 240-249 in 201-300, 340-349 in 301-400, and 440-449 in 401-500. But since we only go up to 488, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 5\u00d710=50. So that's correct.\n\nFor hundreds place, 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89.\n\nSo total 4's: 48+50+89=187.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,28,...,488. The last one is 488, which is the 49th term because 488-8=480, 480/10=48, so 48+1=49. So 49 times.\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was 48, but now I'm thinking it's 49. Let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So 49 times.\n\nTens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 8's in the tens place. That's 4\u00d710=40. The last block is 480-488, which has 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So 9 more. So total tens place 8's: 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: As before, none, since the book ends at 488, which is less than 800. So 0.\n\nSo total 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought 8's were 97, but now I'm getting 98. Let me check again.\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nTens place: 40 from the first four blocks, and 9 from 480-488, so 49.\n\nSo total 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nSo 4's:187, 8's:98.\n\nDifference:187-98=89.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 187 and 8's were 97, but now I'm getting 8's as 98. So which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me recount.\n\nIn the tens place, the blocks are:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n\n- 180-189: 10.\n\n- 280-289:10.\n\n- 380-389:10.\n\n- 480-488:9.\n\nSo that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, totaling 4\u00d710 +9=49.\n\nSo units place:49, tens place:49, total 8's:98.\n\nSo 4's:187, 8's:98. So difference is 187-98=89.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place for 8's was 49, but in the initial count, I thought it was 48. So which is correct?\n\nWait, let's list the numbers ending with 8 up to 488.\n\nThe first is 8, then 18,28,...,488.\n\nThe number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49.\n\nSo yes, 49 times.\n\nSo 8's: units 49, tens 49, total 98.\n\n4's:187.\n\nSo difference:187-98=89.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count any numbers. For example, is there any overlap where a page number has both a 4 and an 8? But when counting digits, each digit is counted separately, so overlapping doesn't affect the total counts.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, no hundreds place.\n\nSo, I think the correct counts are:\n\n4's:187\n\n8's:98\n\nDifference:89.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference was 90, but now it's 89. So I must have made a mistake in the initial count.\n\nWait, let me recalculate:\n\n4's:\n\n- Units:48\n\n- Tens:50\n\n- Hundreds:89\n\nTotal:48+50=98, 98+89=187.\n\n8's:\n\n- Units:49\n\n- Tens:49\n\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nSo difference:187-98=89.\n\nYes, so the correct difference is 89.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 4's again. From 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 4's in the tens place, so 5\u00d710=50. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, 4 blocks of 10 and one of 9, totaling 49.\n\nSo yes, the difference is 89.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should probably break down the problem into smaller parts. Maybe I can count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, I need to consider all these numbers and count the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nI think the best way is to handle each digit place separately. That is, count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the units place, then in the tens place, and finally in the hundreds place. Then, sum them up for each digit.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times a specific digit appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then adjusting for any remainder.\n\nWait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, for the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times, and then the digits 0 to 8 appear once more in the last partial block. So, for the digit 4, it appears 48 times in the units place, plus one more in the last 8 numbers, making it 49 times. Similarly, for the digit 8, it's also 48 times plus one more, so 49 times. Hmm, that's interesting. So, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. If I have 488 pages, the units digit cycles every 10 pages. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488) will have units digits from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once more (at 484), and 8 appears once more (at 488). Therefore, total units place counts: 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, they are equal in the units place.\n\nMoving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers, with each digit from 0 to 9 appearing 10 times in each cycle. So, for example, from 0-99, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. Similarly, from 100-199, it's the same, and so on.\n\nLet me calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place. The total number of pages is 488, so let's break it down into hundreds.\n\nFirst, consider the hundreds place separately, but maybe I should handle the tens place first.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of each digit place separately. So, for the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So, in 488 pages, how many full hundreds are there? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then the remaining 88 pages (401-488).\n\nSo, for the tens place, in each full hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 full hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times each digit appears in the tens place. Now, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), let's see how the tens digit behaves.\n\nFrom 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. Let me see: 401-410: tens digit is 0, 411-420: tens digit is 1, ..., 481-490: tens digit is 8, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers.\n\nWait, but actually, 401-410 is 10 numbers, 411-420 is another 10, and so on. So, from 401 to 488, how many full tens blocks are there? Let's see: 401-410, 411-420, 421-430, 431-440, 441-450, 451-460, 461-470, 471-480, and then 481-488. So, that's 9 blocks, each with a tens digit from 0 to 8. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers except the last one, which has 8 numbers.\n\nSo, in the tens place, for each digit from 0 to 8, they each appear 10 times, except for 8, which appears 10 times in 471-480 and then 8 more times in 481-488, making it 18 times for 8. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 471-480 is the 8th block, and 481-488 is the 9th block, but the tens digit in 481-488 is 8, so that's 8 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, in the tens place, for the remaining 88 pages, each digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 (from 471-480) + 8 (from 481-488) = 18 times.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because 481-488 is only 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for those 8 numbers. So, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears 10 times in 471-480 and 8 times in 481-488, totaling 18 times. But wait, 471-480 is 10 numbers, so the tens digit is 7 in 471-480? Wait, no, 471-480: 471, 472,...,480. So, the tens digit is 7 in 471-480? Wait, no, 471 is 4 7 1, so tens digit is 7, 472 is 4 7 2, up to 480, which is 4 8 0. Wait, so actually, 471-480: the tens digit changes from 7 to 8 at 480. Wait, that's confusing. Let me correct that.\n\nActually, from 401-410: tens digit is 0\n411-420: tens digit is 1\n...\n471-480: tens digit is 7\n481-490: tens digit is 8\n\nBut since we only go up to 488, 481-488 is part of the 481-490 block, where the tens digit is 8. So, in 481-488, the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers. So, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the 481-490 block, but since we only have 8 numbers, it's 8 times. Wait, no, because 481-480 doesn't make sense. Wait, 471-480: the tens digit is 7, and 481-490: tens digit is 8. So, in 481-488, the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers. So, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the 481-490 block, but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 times. Wait, but 481-488 is part of the 481-490 block, which would have 10 numbers, but we only have 8. So, the digit 8 in the tens place appears 8 times in this partial block.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the digit 8 appears 8 times, and digits 0-7 each appear 10 times in their respective blocks. Wait, but from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, but in the last block, 481-488, the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers. So, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears 8 times in the last partial block, and in the previous blocks, 401-470, each tens digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times. So, total for the tens place in 401-488:\n\n- Digits 0-7: 10 times each\n- Digit 8: 8 times\n\nSo, in the tens place, digit 8 appears 8 times in the remaining 88 pages. But wait, earlier I thought each full hundred contributes 10 times each digit, so 4 full hundreds would contribute 40 times each digit in the tens place. But now, in the remaining 88 pages, digit 8 appears 8 times. So, total for the tens place:\n\n- Digit 4: 40 times (from the full hundreds) plus any additional in the remaining 88 pages. Wait, in the remaining 88 pages, does the digit 4 appear in the tens place? Let me check.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit is 0 in 401-410, 1 in 411-420, ..., 7 in 471-480, and 8 in 481-488. So, the digit 4 doesn't appear in the tens place in the remaining 88 pages because 401-488's tens digits go from 0 to 8, but 4 isn't among them. Wait, no, 401-410: tens digit is 0, so 401 is 4 0 1, so the tens digit is 0. So, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit is 0,1,2,3,4,... up to 8? Wait, no, 401-410: tens digit is 0, 411-420: tens digit is 1, ..., 441-450: tens digit is 4, right? Wait, no, 441-450 would have tens digit 4. Wait, 441 is 4 4 1, so yes, the tens digit is 4 in 441-450. So, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 numbers. So, in the tens place, digit 4 appears 10 times in the remaining 88 pages.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digits go up to 8, but 441-450 is part of 401-488, so yes, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times in 441-450. So, in the tens place, digit 4 appears 10 times in the remaining 88 pages, and digit 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, total for the tens place:\n\n- Digit 4: 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 = 50 times\n- Digit 8: 40 (from full hundreds) + 8 = 48 times\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. Each full hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 full hundreds would have 4*10=40 times each digit in the tens place. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, yes, total for tens place:\n\n- 4: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 8: 40 + 8 = 48\n\nOkay, so in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 48 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. Let's see, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so it doesn't contribute. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299: 2; 300-399:3; 400-488:4.\n\nSo, for the hundreds place, we need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nFirst, for digit 4 in the hundreds place: it appears from page 400 to 488. That's 89 pages (400-488 inclusive). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about digit 8 in the hundreds place? Looking at the page numbers, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, digit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, summarizing the hundreds place:\n\n- 4: 89 times\n- 8: 0 times\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences for each digit in all places.\n\nFor digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times\n\nFor digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 48 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97 times\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\n- 488 pages, units digit cycles every 10. 488 /10 = 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8. So, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, units place: 4 appears 48 +1=49, 8 appears 48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Full hundreds: 4 sets, each contributing 10 times for each digit, so 4*10=40 for both 4 and 8.\n- Remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n  - For 4 in tens place: 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n  - For 8 in tens place: 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times.\n- So, total for 4: 40 +10=50, 8: 40+8=48. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n- 8 never appears in hundreds place. Correct.\n\nTotal counts:\n\n- 4: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8: 49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =97\n\nDifference: 188 -97=91.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. Therefore, there are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should understand the problem clearly. Each page from 1 to 488 is numbered once, and I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to get the difference.\n\nAlright, so I'll start by considering how digits are distributed in page numbers. Page numbers can be one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit numbers. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488, which is a three-digit number. So, I need to consider all three-digit numbers up to 488.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to separate the counting based on the number of digits. That is, count the number of 4's and 8's in the units place, tens place, and hundreds place separately, and then sum them up.\n\nLet me start with the units place.\n\n**Units Place:**\n\nFor the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in the units place as the numbers increase. So, in every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), each digit appears exactly once in the units place.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488).\n\nIn each complete block, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears once. So, for 48 complete blocks, the number of 4's in the units place is 48, and similarly, the number of 8's is 48.\n\nNow, the partial block from 481 to 488. Let's list the units digits here: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So, in this partial block, the digit 4 appears once (at 484), and the digit 8 appears once (at 488).\n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49\nTotal 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, in the units place, both 4's and 8's appear 49 times each.\n\nHmm, but let me double-check that. Since the partial block ends at 488, which is the 8th number after 480. So, units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 and 8 are both present once. So yes, that seems correct.\n\n**Tens Place:**\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each block of 100 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place.\n\nFor example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. Each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, in 101-200, the pattern repeats, and so on.\n\nSo, first, let's figure out how many complete hundreds are there in 488. Well, 488 is less than 500, so we have 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nSo, that's five blocks: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nNow, for each complete block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n\nSo, for the first four complete blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, 4 blocks * 10 = 40 4's and 40 8's.\n\nNow, the last block is 400-488. Let's look at the tens place here.\n\nNumbers from 400-488. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8, but since we're only going up to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). But wait, 488 is the last page, so the tens digit in 480-488 is 8, but only up to 488.\n\nSo, in the tens place, for 400-488, how many times does each digit appear?\n\n- For tens digit 0: 400-409, which is 10 numbers.\n- Tens digit 1: 410-419, 10 numbers.\n- Tens digit 2: 420-429, 10 numbers.\n- Tens digit 3: 430-439, 10 numbers.\n- Tens digit 4: 440-449, 10 numbers.\n- Tens digit 5: 450-459, 10 numbers.\n- Tens digit 6: 460-469, 10 numbers.\n- Tens digit 7: 470-479, 10 numbers.\n- Tens digit 8: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, right? Wait, 480 is the first, and 488 is the 9th because 480 is the 1st, 481 is 2nd, up to 488 as the 9th.\n\nWait, actually, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9.\n\nSo, for the tens digit 8 in 400-488, it appears 9 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place for 400-488:\n\n- 4's: 10 times (440-449)\n- 8's: 9 times (480-488)\n\nSo, adding up, the total 4's in the tens place:\n\nComplete blocks: 40\nPartial block: 10\nTotal 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n\nSimilarly, total 8's in the tens place:\n\nComplete blocks: 40\nPartial block: 9\nTotal 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\nWait, so in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 49 times.\n\nWait, that seems correct because in the partial block, 4's have a full 10 numbers, while 8's only have 9.\n\nSo, for the tens place:\n\n4's: 50\n8's: 49\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is more straightforward because it only changes every 100 numbers.\n\nIn a 488-page book, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nWait, actually, page 1 is just 1, so the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, let's see how many times each hundreds digit appears.\n\n- Hundreds digit 0: pages 1-99, which is 99 pages, but the hundreds digit is 0, so it's 99 times. But wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 0 for all numbers from 0-99, but since we start at page 1, it's 1-99, which is 99 pages, but the hundreds digit is 0 for all of them. So, the digit 0 appears 99 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but in our problem, we're only concerned with digits 4 and 8. So, let's see when the hundreds digit is 4 or 8.\n\nLooking at the hundreds digit:\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: pages 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n\n- Hundreds digit 8: Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit never reaches 8 because 800 would be beyond 488. So, the hundreds digit 8 never appears.\n\nWait, but let me check: 488 is less than 500, so the hundreds digits go up to 4. So, hundreds digit 8 doesn't appear at all in this book.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89 times (from 400-488)\n- 8's: 0 times\n\nWait, that seems correct because 400-488 is 89 pages, each with hundreds digit 4, and 8's in the hundreds place never occur because the book doesn't go up to 800.\n\nWait, but wait a second, 400-488 is 89 pages, right? Because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nSo, hundreds place:\n\n4's: 89\n8's: 0\n\n**Now, let's sum up all the digits:**\n\nWe'll sum up the counts from units, tens, and hundreds places for both 4's and 8's.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate that.\n\n49 + 50 = 99\n99 + 89 = 188\n\nSo, total 4's: 188\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, total 8's: 98\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 4's appear 188 times, and 8's appear 98 times.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- 488 pages, so units digit cycles every 10. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8, so 48 each. Then the partial cycle from 481-488, which has 484 (4) and 488 (8), so 1 each. So, total 4's in units: 48 +1=49, same for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each full hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. There are four full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), so 4*10=40 each. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, 4's: 40+10=50, 8's:40+9=49. That adds up correctly.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 400-488: 89 pages with hundreds digit 4. 8's never appear in the hundreds place here, so 0. That seems correct.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nWait, so the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me think again about the hundreds place. I concluded that the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times because there are 89 pages from 400 to 488. But wait, 400 is the first page with hundreds digit 4, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 +1 = 89 pages, each with hundreds digit 4. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I think about it, 400-488 is 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me think about the tens and units digits in the 400-488 range. For example, in 400-488, each number has a hundreds digit of 4, but the tens and units digits can vary. So, in the hundreds place, it's 89 4's, but in the tens and units places, we've already considered those separately.\n\nSo, adding up, the total 4's are correctly 188, and 8's are 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When counting the hundreds place, I considered that each page from 400-488 has a hundreds digit of 4, which is correct. But I also need to make sure that I'm not double-counting any digits. But no, because when I count units, tens, and hundreds separately, each digit is counted in its respective place, so there's no overlap.\n\nWait, another way to check: Let's calculate the total number of digits printed.\n\nEach page from 1-9: 1 digit each, so 9 pages *1=9 digits\nPages 10-99: 90 pages, 2 digits each: 90*2=180 digits\nPages 100-488: 488-99=389 pages, but wait, 100-488 is 389 pages? Wait, no, 488-100+1=389 pages, each with 3 digits: 389*3=1167 digits\n\nSo total digits: 9 + 180 + 1167 = 1356 digits.\n\nNow, total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so total digits accounted for by 4's and 8's is 188+98=286.\n\nBut total digits are 1356, so 286 is less than that, which is fine because other digits are also present.\n\nWait, but just to make sure my counts for 4's and 8's are reasonable.\n\nWait, 4's: 188, 8's:98, so 188-98=90.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of another way to count, perhaps using digit positions.\n\nWait, another approach: For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\nAs before, 488 pages, so 488 /10 =48 full cycles, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8, so 48 each, plus the partial cycle from 481-488, which has 484 and 488, so 1 each. So, units:49 each.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place. So, for 488 pages, how many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 each.\n\nThen, the last partial hundred:400-488. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, for 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does each appear?\n\nFrom 400-409: tens digit 0, 10 numbers\n410-419: tens digit 1, 10 numbers\n...\n440-449: tens digit 4, 10 numbers\n...\n480-488: tens digit 8, 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, in the tens place for 400-488:\n\n- 4's:10\n- 8's:9\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's in tens place:40 +10=50\n8's in tens place:40 +9=49\n\nHundreds place:\n\nAs before, 400-488:89 pages, each with hundreds digit 4, so 89 4's\n8's in hundreds place:0\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about another way. Maybe using the formula for digit frequency.\n\nFor a given digit d in a certain position, the number of times it appears can be calculated using the formula based on higher digits and lower digits.\n\nBut maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, I can think of each position separately.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me check again.\n\nFrom page 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 -400 +1=89 numbers. Each of these has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo, the hundreds place contributes 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nWait, another check: Let's consider the total number of 4's and 8's in each position.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 4's:49\n- 8's:49\n\nTens place:\n\n- 4's:50\n- 8's:49\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's:89\n- 8's:0\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's:49+50+89=188\n8's:49+49+0=98\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**1. Units Place:**\n- Each digit 0-9 appears equally in the units place.\n- Total complete blocks of 10: 48 (480 numbers).\n- Each block contributes 1 '4' and 1 '8'.\n- Partial block (481-488): 1 '4' (484) and 1 '8' (488).\n- Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n- Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n**2. Tens Place:**\n- Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times per hundred.\n- Complete hundreds (0-399): 4 blocks, each contributing 10 '4's and 10 '8's.\n- Partial block (400-488): 10 '4's (440-449) and 9 '8's (480-488).\n- Total 4's: 4\u00d710 + 10 = 50\n- Total 8's: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49\n\n**3. Hundreds Place:**\n- Pages 400-488: 89 pages with '4' in the hundreds place.\n- No '8's in the hundreds place.\n- Total 4's: 89\n- Total 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488, and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nAlright, let's start by considering how digits are structured in page numbers. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 up to 488. So, the page numbers can be broken down as follows:\n\n- Pages 1-9: one-digit numbers\n- Pages 10-99: two-digit numbers\n- Pages 100-488: three-digit numbers\n\nI think I should handle each of these ranges separately to count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nLet me start with the one-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digits 4 and 8 each appear exactly once. So, for the one-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 occur once.\n\nNow, moving on to the two-digit numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each number has a tens place and a units place. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in the two-digit numbers. In the units place, 4 can appear in 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 times. In the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49, which is 10 times. Wait, but 44 is already counted in both, but I think it's okay because each digit is considered separately. So, total 4's in two-digit numbers would be 9 (units) + 10 (tens) = 19.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in two-digit numbers. In the units place, 8 appears in 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's 9 times. In the tens place, 8 appears in 80-89, which is 10 times. So, total 8's would be 9 + 10 = 19.\n\nWait, but in the tens place for 4, it's 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, 80-89 is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, for two-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear 19 times each. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the three-digit numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because each number has hundreds, tens, and units places. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nLet me break it down by each digit place: hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book ends at 488. So, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in the hundreds place. That's only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? Let's see, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers, meaning 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, the digit 8 in the hundreds place: since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times for 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, let's move to the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be from 0 to 9, but we need to consider how many times 4 and 8 appear in this position across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to break it down by each hundred range:\n\n1. 100-199\n2. 200-299\n3. 300-399\n4. 400-488\n\nFor each of these, let's count the number of times 4 and 8 appear in the tens and units places.\n\nStarting with 100-199:\n\n- Tens place: The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each hundred. So, for 4 in the tens place, it's 140-149. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n- Similarly, for 8 in the tens place, it's 180-189, which is 10 times.\n\nSame logic applies to 200-299 and 300-399:\n\n- In each hundred, 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (e.g., 240-249, 340-349).\n- Similarly, 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 280-289, 380-389).\n\nNow, for 400-488:\n\n- Tens place: The tens digit can be from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for 4 in the tens place, it's 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n- For 8 in the tens place, it's 480-488. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 times.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, 9 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for the tens place across all three-digit numbers.\n\nFor 4 in the tens place:\n- 100-199: 10\n- 200-299: 10\n- 300-399: 10\n- 400-488: 10\nTotal: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 times.\n\nWait, but in 400-488, the tens digit for 4 is only 440-449, which is 10 numbers, correct. So, yes, 10 times.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place:\n- 100-199: 10\n- 200-299: 10\n- 300-399: 10\n- 400-488: 9\nTotal: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, that seems correct because in 400-488, the tens digit 8 only goes up to 488, which is 9 numbers instead of 10.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. Similarly, we'll check each hundred range.\n\nStarting with 100-199:\n\n- Units place: For each tens digit, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, for each ten, 4 appears once in the units place (e.g., 104, 114, ..., 194). There are 10 such tens digits (0-9), so 10 times for 4.\n- Similarly, 8 appears once per ten, so 10 times for 8.\n\nSame logic applies to 200-299 and 300-399:\n\n- Each hundred contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the units place.\n\nNow, for 400-488:\n\n- The units digit cycles from 0 to 9, but we have to consider up to 488. Let's see, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nFrom 400-488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each ten, 4 appears once. How many tens are there?\n\nFrom 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, that's 9 tens (0-8). Each ten contributes one 4 in the units place, so 9 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the units place:\n\nFrom 400-488, the units digit 8 appears once every ten. So, in each ten, it's 408, 418, ..., 488. But wait, 488 is included, so how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nFrom 400-488, the units digit 8 occurs in 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. Yes, 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nNow, let me sum up the units place counts for 4 and 8.\n\nFor 4 in the units place across three-digit numbers:\n- 100-199: 10\n- 200-299: 10\n- 300-399: 10\n- 400-488: 9\nTotal: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nFor 8 in the units place:\n- 100-199: 10\n- 200-299: 10\n- 300-399: 10\n- 400-488: 9\nTotal: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 39 times each in the three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, let me compile all the counts for 4 and 8.\n\nFirst, for 4:\n\n- One-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: hundreds place: 89, tens place: 40, units place: 39\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 89 + 40 + 39\n\nWait, hold on, I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the three-digit numbers, I've already broken down the hundreds, tens, and units places. So, I should sum those.\n\nWait, let me correct that. So, in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 times (for 4)\n- Tens place: 40 times (for 4)\n- Units place: 39 times (for 4)\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0\n- Tens place: 39 times\n- Units place: 39 times\nTotal 8's in three-digit numbers: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nWait, but let me check the three-digit counts again because I think I might have miscalculated somewhere.\n\nWait, let me recalculate:\n\nFor 4's in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n- Tens place: 100-199: 10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:10, so total 40.\n- Units place: 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9, so total 39.\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nFor 8's in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0\n- Tens place: 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9, so total 39.\n- Units place: 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9, so total 39.\nSo, 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nNow, let's add the counts from one-digit and two-digit numbers.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- One-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- One-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high for 8's. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, for three-digit numbers, 8's in tens place: 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSimilarly, units place: same as tens place, 39. So, 39+39=78, plus one-digit and two-digit 19 each. So, 1+19+78=98.\n\nHmm, okay, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the three-digit numbers. For example, in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. In the tens place, across all three-digit numbers, 4 appears 40 times, and in the units place, 39 times. So, 89+40+39=168.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, in the tens place, 39 times, and units place, 39 times, so 78.\n\nNow, adding the one-digit and two-digit counts:\n\n4's: 1 (one-digit) +19 (two-digit) +168 (three-digit) = 188.\n\n8's: 1 (one-digit) +19 (two-digit) +78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me see if I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I overcounted in the three-digit numbers. Let me check the tens place for 4 in three-digit numbers again.\n\nIn the tens place for 4 in three-digit numbers:\n\n- 100-199: 140-149, that's 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n- 200-299: 240-249, 10 times.\n- 300-399: 340-349, 10 times.\n- 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers (440-449), correct.\n\nSo, 10+10+10+10=40, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place:\n\n- 100-199: 180-189, 10 times.\n- 200-299: 280-289, 10 times.\n- 300-399: 380-389, 10 times.\n- 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), so 9 times.\n\nSo, 10+10+10+9=39, correct.\n\nUnits place for 4 in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Each hundred contributes 10 times for 4 in the units place, except for 400-488, which contributes 9 times because it stops at 488.\n\nSo, 10+10+10+9=39, correct.\n\nSame for 8 in the units place: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, 39+39=78 for 8's in three-digit numbers.\n\nThus, 4's total: 1+19+168=188.\n\n8's total:1+19+78=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again: 4's: 188, 8's:98, difference 90.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by considering each digit place separately across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nLet me try that method to cross-verify.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nWell, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, total numbers from 1 to 488: 488.\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: 488 // 10 = 48 groups, with 8 remaining.\n\nEach group contributes 1 occurrence of 4 in the units place, so 48 times.\n\nPlus, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 484 has a 4 in the units place, so 1 more.\n\nTotal units place 4's: 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, units place 8's: every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. So, 488//10=48 groups, each contributing 1, so 48 times.\n\nIn the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 488 has an 8 in the units place, so 1 more.\n\nTotal units place 8's:48 +1=49.\n\nNow, tens place:\n\nHow many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nEach ten's digit cycles every 100 numbers. For each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many hundreds do we have?\n\n- 1-99: 100 numbers\n- 100-199: 100\n- 200-299:100\n- 300-399:100\n- 400-488:89 numbers\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, except for the last partial hundred.\n\nSo, in 1-99: 40-49, 10 times.\n\nIn 100-199:140-149, 10 times.\n\nIn 200-299:240-249,10 times.\n\nIn 300-399:340-349,10 times.\n\nIn 400-488:440-449, which is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so 10 times.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 10 (1-99) +10 (100-199)+10 (200-299)+10 (300-399)+10 (400-488) = 50 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place:\n\nIn 1-99:80-89, 10 times.\n\nIn 100-199:180-189,10 times.\n\nIn 200-299:280-289,10 times.\n\nIn 300-399:380-389,10 times.\n\nIn 400-488:480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), so 9 times.\n\nTotal tens place 8's:10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nHow many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place?\n\nFrom 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nHow many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? Since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the digit counts.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, same result as before. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we need to count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\n### Counting 4's:\n1. **One-digit numbers (1-9):**\n   - 4 appears once.\n\n2. **Two-digit numbers (10-99):**\n   - Units place: 4 appears in 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94 (9 times).\n   - Tens place: 4 appears in 40-49 (10 times).\n   - Total: 9 + 10 = 19 times.\n\n3. **Three-digit numbers (100-488):**\n   - Hundreds place: 4 appears in 400-488 (89 times).\n   - Tens place: 4 appears in 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 (10 times each, total 40 times).\n   - Units place: 4 appears once every 10 numbers across all hundreds, except for 400-488 (9 times).\n   - Total: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 times.\n\n**Total 4's:**\n- 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n\n### Counting 8's:\n1. **One-digit numbers (1-9):**\n   - 8 appears once.\n\n2. **Two-digit numbers (10-99):**\n   - Units place: 8 appears in 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98 (9 times).\n   - Tens place: 8 appears in 80-89 (10 times).\n   - Total: 9 + 10 = 19 times.\n\n3. **Three-digit numbers (100-488):**\n   - Hundreds place: 8 does not appear.\n   - Tens place: 8 appears in 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 (9 times).\n   - Units place: 8 appears once every 10 numbers across all hundreds, except for 400-488 (9 times).\n   - Total: 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78 times.\n\n**Total 8's:**\n- 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\n### Difference:\n- Number of 4's: 188\n- Number of 8's: 98\n- Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nThus, the number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should understand how page numbers are structured. Each page number is a number from 1 to 488. So, I'll need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to get the answer.\n\nLet me start by considering the digits in each place: units, tens, hundreds. Since 488 is a three-digit number, I'll have to check each digit place separately for both 4 and 8.\n\nI'll start with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each block of 10 numbers. So, in every 10 pages, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in the units place. But since the first page is 1, the first block is 1-10, where 0 doesn't appear in the units place. Hmm, wait, no, actually, page 10 is included, so in the first 10 pages, the units digits are 1-0, so 0 appears once (at page 10). But maybe it's easier to consider the entire range from 1 to 488 and calculate the number of times each digit appears in each place.\n\nLet me formalize this. For each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), I can calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\n- For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 repeats every 10 numbers. So, in 488 pages, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n\nIn each complete block of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does the digit 8. So, for 48 complete blocks, that's 48 times each for both 4 and 8 in the units place.\n\nNow, for the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in these, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nWait, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. So, the count is equal here. Hmm, maybe I should check my calculation again.\n\nWait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing 1 to both 4 and 8 in the units place. Then, the last partial block is from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in this partial block, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, total units place 4's: 48 * 1 + 1 = 49. Similarly, 8's: 48 * 1 + 1 = 49. So, same count.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nFor the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. So, in 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Then, the remaining 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n\nSo, for 4 complete hundreds, 4 * 10 = 40 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, the remaining 88 pages are from 401 to 488. Let's break this down:\n\nFrom 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles through 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 401-410: tens digit is 0, 411-420: 1, 421-430: 2, 431-440: 3, 441-450: 4, 451-460:5, 461-470:6, 471-480:7, and 481-488:8. So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears exactly 10 times except for 8, which appears only 8 times because 488 is the last page.\n\nWait, no, let's check: from 481 to 488, the tens digit is 8, and there are 8 numbers (481-488), so the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers. So, for the tens place in 401-488:\n\n- 0: 10 times (401-410)\n- 1: 10 times (411-420)\n- 2: 10 times (421-430)\n- 3: 10 times (431-440)\n- 4: 10 times (441-450)\n- 5: 10 times (451-460)\n- 6: 10 times (461-470)\n- 7: 10 times (471-480)\n- 8: 8 times (481-488)\n\nSo, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). Therefore, in the tens place, total 4's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 = 50, and 8's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 8 = 48.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 48 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nFor the hundreds digit, each digit from 1 to 4 appears in the hundreds place, but only once each except for 4, which appears from 400-488.\n\nWait, let me think. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399 and 400-488.\n\nWait, actually, no. Wait, 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, but since we're only considering page numbers starting from 1, the hundreds digit is 0 for 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nWait, but in page numbers, the hundreds digit is 0 for 1-99, but since we're considering each page number as a three-digit number, maybe I should include leading zeros, but in reality, page numbers don't have leading zeros, so 1 is just 1, not 001. Hmm, but when counting digits, maybe it's better to consider each number as a three-digit number with leading zeros, so 1 becomes 001, 10 becomes 010, etc., so that each digit place can be analyzed separately. But wait, in reality, page numbers don't have leading zeros, so for example, page 1 is just '1', so the hundreds digit doesn't exist. Hmm, this might complicate things.\n\nWait, maybe I should adjust my approach. Let's consider the hundreds digit as follows:\n\n- Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (but since page numbers don't have leading zeros, these pages don't have a hundreds digit, so the hundreds place doesn't contribute any digits here. So, the hundreds digit is only present from page 100 onwards.\n\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1\n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2\n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4\n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, the digit 8 in the hundreds place would be if there were pages from 800 onwards, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. Pages 400-488: that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, yes, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times\n\nFor the digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 48 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97 times\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- 488 pages. Each 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing 1 to 4 and 8. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For each 100 pages, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each 100, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times. There are 4 complete hundreds (1-400), so 4 * 10 = 40 for both 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n\n- Then, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 441-450, which is 10 pages. The tens digit is 8 for 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times. So, total tens place: 4's = 40 + 10 = 50, 8's = 40 + 8 = 48. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (but not printed, so no contribution)\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1\n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2\n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 pages (400-488 inclusive)\n- Pages 500-...: beyond 488, so no.\n\nSo, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but let me check if I considered all digits properly.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the tens place for the 401-488 range.\n\nWait, from 401 to 488, the tens digit goes through 0-8, each appearing 10 times except for 8, which appears 8 times because the last partial decade is 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, that's correct.\n\nWait, another way: for the tens digit in 401-488, how many times does each digit appear?\n\n- 0: 10 times (401-410)\n- 1: 10 times (411-420)\n- 2: 10 times (421-430)\n- 3: 10 times (431-440)\n- 4: 10 times (441-450)\n- 5: 10 times (451-460)\n- 6: 10 times (461-470)\n- 7: 10 times (471-480)\n- 8: 8 times (481-488)\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, the total counts seem accurate.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97, so 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me check another approach to make sure.\n\nAnother way is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nTotal numbers = 488\n\nNumber of complete cycles of 10: 488 // 10 = 48\n\nEach cycle contributes 1 occurrence of 4 and 1 of 8.\n\nSo, 48 * 1 = 48 for both.\n\nThen, the remaining numbers: 488 % 10 = 8\n\nSo, the last 8 numbers are 481-488, which have units digits 1-8. So, 4 appears once, 8 appears once.\n\nSo, units digit total: 48 + 1 = 49 for both.\n\nTens digit:\n\nNumber of complete cycles of 100: 488 // 100 = 4\n\nEach cycle contributes 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place.\n\nSo, 4 * 10 = 40 for both.\n\nRemaining numbers: 488 % 100 = 88\n\nSo, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8, with each digit from 0-7 appearing 10 times and 8 appearing 8 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, total tens digit: 4's = 40 + 10 = 50, 8's = 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nHundreds digit:\n\nNumber of complete cycles of 1000: 0, since 488 < 1000.\n\nBut we can look at the hundreds digit:\n\n- Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (not printed)\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1\n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2\n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4\n\nSo, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and 8 never appears.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers is 188, and the digit 8 appears 97 times. The difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I guess I should consider each digit place separately: the units place and the tens place. Because a page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number, right? But since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, I need to check how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and how many times 8 appears, and then find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For the units digit, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does each digit appear in the units place? Well, for every block of 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once. But since we're starting from 1, maybe the first block is 1-10, where the units digits are 1-0. Hmm, but wait, actually, when counting from 1 to 488, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in the units place, except maybe the last partial block.\n\nWait, no, actually, the number of times each digit appears in the units place is the same for each digit from 0 to 9, except for the last digit if the total number isn't a multiple of 10. Let me calculate how many complete tens we have in 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete tens and then 8 more numbers.\n\nIn each complete ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 appears once. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 times 1, which is 48, plus any additional 4's in the last partial block. The last partial block is 481-488, so the units digits are 1-8. So, does 4 appear here? Yes, at 484. So, that's one more 4. Similarly, does 8 appear? Yes, at 488. So, that's one more 8.\n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\nTotal 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each? That's interesting, so the difference here is zero.\n\nNow, let me check the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and similarly for 8.\n\nNow, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more numbers (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times for 4, and 40 times for 8.\n\nNow, the partial hundred is 401-488. Let's look at the tens digits here. The tens digit goes from 0 (for 401-410) to 8 (for 481-488). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? Well, when the tens digit is 4, that's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 times. Similarly, how about 8 in the tens place? That would be 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many numbers are there? Each tens digit from 0 to 7 would have 10 numbers, but the last one, 8, has only 9 numbers because 488 is the end. So, for the tens digit 4, that's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times the digit 4 appears. For the tens digit 8, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nTherefore, in the partial hundred (401-488), the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 10 from the partial hundred, totaling 50.\nTotal 8's in tens place: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 9 from the partial hundred, totaling 49.\n\nWait, that's 50 for 4's and 49 for 8's in the tens place. So, the difference here is 50 - 49 = 1 more 4.\n\nNow, I should also check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case because the book has 488 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 1 for 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, and 4 for 300-399 and 400-488.\n\nWait, but 300-399 is hundreds digit 3, and 400-488 is hundreds digit 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (400-488 inclusive). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have hundreds digit 8, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the digit 8 appears zero times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\nTotal 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's.\n\nNow, let me sum up the differences from each place.\n\nFrom the units place, the difference was 0 (49-49).\nFrom the tens place, the difference was +1 (50-49).\nFrom the hundreds place, the difference was +89 (89-0).\n\nSo, total difference is 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, so 4's appear 90 more times than 8's in the page numbers.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 48 complete tens, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then the last 8 numbers (481-488) have one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So, total 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's, so 40 each. Then in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total 50 for 4's and 49 for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 appears. 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 89 more 4's.\n\nAdding up: 0 (units) +1 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times the hundreds digit is 4. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but does 400 count as a page? Yes, because page numbers start at 1 and go up to 488, so 400 is included. So, 400 is counted as one of the 89 numbers where the hundreds digit is 4.\n\nWait, but when I was calculating the hundreds place, I considered only 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the units and tens places again. For the units place, in the last partial block, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1 through 8, so 484 is included, which adds one more 4, and 488 adds one more 8. So, units digits: 49 each.\n\nFor the tens place, in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 10 more 4's and 9 more 8's in the tens place beyond the 40 each from the complete hundreds.\n\nSo, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's in tens place, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's in tens place.\n\nSo, the difference in tens place is 1, which adds to the 89 from the hundreds place, making 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly. So, from 1-399, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90 more 4's than 8's. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the counts again to make sure.\n\nUnits place: 488 pages. Each 10 pages, the units digit cycles 0-9. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 and one 8. So, 48 each. Then the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8. So, 484 has a 4, and 488 has an 8. So, total 49 each.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) give 4*10=40 each. Then in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449 (10 times), and 8 for 480-488 (9 times). So, 40+10=50 for 4's, 40+9=49 for 8's.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 appears. 8 never appears in hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think about the page numbers again. When the book is printed, the first page is 1, then 2, up to 488. So, page numbers are from 1 to 488, inclusive.\n\nWait, but when I calculated the hundreds place, I included 400-488, which is correct because 400 is a valid page number.\n\nWait, but let me check if 400 is counted correctly. Yes, 400 is included, so that's correct.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in the units place every 10 numbers.\n   - There are 48 complete tens (488 / 10 = 48.8), contributing 48 occurrences each of 4 and 8.\n   - The last 8 numbers (481-488) add one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488).\n   - **Total 4's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n   - **Total 8's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers.\n   - There are 4 complete hundreds (488 / 100 = 4.88), contributing 40 occurrences each of 4 and 8.\n   - The last 88 numbers (401-488) add 10 occurrences of 4 (440-449) and 9 occurrences of 8 (480-488).\n   - **Total 4's in tens place:** 40 + 10 = 50\n   - **Total 8's in tens place:** 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - The hundreds digit never reaches 8 in this range.\n   - **Total 4's in hundreds place:** 89\n   - **Total 8's in hundreds place:** 0\n\nSumming up the occurrences:\n- **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nThe difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488, and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me break this down. Page numbers can be one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit numbers. So, I should consider each case separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\nStarting with the digit 4. I'll need to count how many times 4 appears in each position.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** For every set of ten consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many such sets are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of ten and then 8 more numbers. Each set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Plus, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit is 4 once (484). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, for the tens place, 4 appears in a block of ten numbers every hundred. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all ten numbers. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages. In each hundred, the tens digit is 4 once for ten numbers. So, 4 times 10 is 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for the numbers 440-449. That's another 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Okay, that seems right.\n\nNow, onto the digit 8. I'll do the same process.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, every set of ten numbers has one 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. Plus, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit is 8 once (488). So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** For the tens digit, 8 appears in blocks of ten every hundred. For example, 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block contributes ten 8's in the tens place. How many such blocks are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds. In each hundred, there's one block of ten where the tens digit is 8, so that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 8's: 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-489. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is nine numbers, right? Wait, no, from 480-489 would be ten numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 for nine numbers, not ten. So, that's 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is nine numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the tens digit is 8 for nine numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 40 (from the full hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800 onwards. But the book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units: 49, tens: 49, hundreds: 0. So, 49 + 49 = 98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me consider each digit place again.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last partial ten (481-488), 484 is the only one, so +1, total 49.\n- Tens: Every hundred has a block of 10 where tens digit is 4 (40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so +10, total 50.\n- Hundreds: From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers (488 - 400 +1 = 89).\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: Same as 4's, 49.\n- Tens: In each hundred, 80-89 contributes 10. So, 4 full hundreds give 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so +9, total 49.\n- Hundreds: None, since 800+ is beyond 488.\n\nSo, yes, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full sets of ten (48 \u00d7 1) + 1 in the last partial set = 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 full hundreds (4 \u00d7 10) + 10 in the last partial hundred = 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 numbers (400-488) = 89.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full sets of ten (48 \u00d7 1) + 1 in the last partial set = 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 full hundreds (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 in the last partial hundred = 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 0.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that each page number is printed once, from 1 to 488. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me break this down by the positions of the digits: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll handle each digit position separately for both 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:** The digits cycle every 10 numbers. So in every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. To find how many such blocks there are up to 488, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full blocks and a remainder of 8. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 times 1, which is 48. But wait, I should check the last partial block from 481 to 488. In this range, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once here as well. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Similarly, the digit 4 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block has 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4 full blocks (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but the last block isn't a full 100. Let me check: from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so that's one full set. So total tens place 4's are 4 times 10, which is 40. Wait, no, because from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So actually, up to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the tens place is 5 times 10? Wait, no, let me think again. Each hundred block (like 0-99, 100-199, etc.) has one block where the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers. So up to 400-499, that's 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-499). But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is only up to 488, but the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total tens place 4's are 5 times 10, which is 50. Wait, but 488 is less than 499, so does that affect the count? Let me check: 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 occurrences. The other blocks are 0-99 (40-49), 100-199 (140-149), 200-299 (240-249), 300-399 (340-349), and 400-488 (440-449). So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. So tens place 4's are 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So total 4's are 188.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. For units place: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing 1, so 48, plus the last partial cycle where 4 appears once, so 49. That seems right.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has one block of 10 where the tens digit is 4. So 400-488 is the fifth such hundred block, so 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's. So total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last partial cycle (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once here as well. So units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each such block has 10 occurrences. How many such blocks are there up to 488? 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 full hundreds. Each hundred has one such block, so 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Now, check if the last partial hundred (400-488) has another block where the tens digit is 8. That would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers here. So total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Each hundred block up to 400 would have a full block of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So 0-99: 80-89 (10), 100-199: 180-189 (10), 200-299: 280-289 (10), 300-399: 380-389 (10). That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So that's 9 more, making total tens place 8's 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the block 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Units place: 48 full cycles, each contributing 1, so 48, plus the last partial cycle where 8 appears once, so 49. That's correct.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40, plus the last partial hundred where 8 appears 9 times, so total 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 0. So total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems right.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, the hundreds place is 0 because the book doesn't go beyond 488, so no page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98, difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 4's. I had 5 blocks contributing 10 each, totaling 50. But wait, 400-488 is the fifth block, but does that include 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, that's correct. So 5 blocks, 10 each, 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, the tens place: 4 full hundreds, each with 10, so 40, plus 9 in the last partial block, totaling 49.\n\nSo yes, 4's: 188, 8's: 98, difference: 90.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488. Then, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Finally, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering how digits are structured in page numbers. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488, which is a three-digit number. So, I'll need to consider units, tens, and hundreds places separately for both 4 and 8.\n\nI'll begin by counting the number of 4's in each place:\n\n1. **Units place**: This is the rightmost digit. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, every 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such numbers are there?\n\nSince the book has 488 pages, the units digit cycles 48 times (because 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8). But since we can't have a fraction of a cycle, I think it's 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, that's 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the last cycle is from 480 to 488. Let me check: from 480 to 488, the units digit goes from 0 to 8, so 484 is included, which is the 48th occurrence. So, units place gives 48 fours.\n\n2. **Tens place**: This is the middle digit. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, in 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, in 140-149, and so on. How many such sets are there up to 488?\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many hundreds there are. The book goes up to 488, which is less than 500. So, we have page numbers from 1-488.\n\nThe tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. Let me count how many such ranges there are.\n\nFrom 0-99: 40-49 is one set.\nFrom 100-199: 140-149 is another.\nFrom 200-299: 240-249.\nFrom 300-399: 340-349.\nFrom 400-488: 440-449.\n\nSo, that's 5 sets where the tens digit is 4. Each set contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, but I should check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's fine.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: This is the leftmost digit. The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place?\n\nFrom 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the fours:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal fours = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nWait, let me check that addition again. 48 + 50 is 98, and 98 + 89 is 187. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, I'll do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place**: Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place from 1 to 488?\n\nAgain, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles. Each cycle gives one 8, so 48 times. But wait, let me check if 488 is included. The units digit of 488 is 8, so that's the 48th occurrence. So, units place gives 48 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place**: The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9. So, how many such ranges?\n\nFrom 0-99: 80-89 is one set (10 numbers).\nFrom 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers).\nFrom 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers).\nFrom 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers).\nFrom 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers).\n\nSo, that's 5 sets, but the last set has only 9 numbers instead of 10. So, the number of eights in the tens place is 4 sets x 10 + 1 set x 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me confirm: 80-89: 10 eights in tens place.\n180-189: 10.\n280-289: 10.\n380-389: 10.\n480-488: 9 (since 480, 481, ..., 488: that's 9 numbers). So, total eights in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899. But since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nAdding up all the eights:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal eights = 48 + 49 = 97.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 48 + 49 is 97, but let me double-check the tens place. I think I might have made a mistake there.\n\nWait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's correct. So, the total eights in the tens place is 49, as calculated.\n\nSo, total eights: 48 (units) + 49 (tens) = 97.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's.\n\nNumber of 4's: 187\nNumber of 8's: 97\nDifference: 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50 (from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449: 5 sets, each with 10, so 50)\n- Hundreds: 89 (from 400-488)\nTotal: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 49 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, so 49)\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 48 + 49 = 97.\n\nSo, 187 - 97 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for 4's would be 90, but no, it's 89. Hmm, maybe I should check the hundreds place again.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place of 4's, 5 sets of 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 fours. Correct.\n\nFor 8's, units place is 48, tens place is 49, correct.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. From 480-488, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place? It's 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, etc.) and one set of 9, totaling 49. Correct.\n\nSo, I think the calculations are correct. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that each page is numbered from 1 to 488, and each number is printed once. So, I need to count how many times the digit '4' appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit '8'. Once I have both counts, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering how digits are structured in numbers. Page numbers can be 1-digit, 2-digit, or 3-digit numbers. So, I should probably handle each case separately.\n\nStarting with 1-digit page numbers: these are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digit '4' appears once (which is page 4), and the digit '8' also appears once (page 8). So, so far, both counts are equal at 1 each.\n\nNext, moving on to 2-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I'll need to count how many times '4' and '8' appear in both the tens and units places.\n\nLet's tackle the tens place first. For '4' in the tens place, the numbers would be 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so '4' appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, for '8' in the tens place, the numbers are 80 to 89, which is another 10 numbers, so '8' appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the units place in 2-digit numbers. For each ten's group (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit '4' appears once in the units place (like 14, 24, 34, etc.), and the same goes for '8' (like 18, 28, 38, etc.). There are 9 groups of ten in the 2-digit numbers (10-99), so '4' appears 9 times in the units place, and '8' also appears 9 times.\n\nAdding up the 2-digit counts: for '4', it's 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times. For '8', it's 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times. So, in 2-digit numbers, both digits appear equally, 19 times each.\n\nWait, but hold on, the page numbers go up to 488, so I can't stop at 99. I need to consider 3-digit page numbers as well, which are from 100 to 488.\n\nLet me break down the 3-digit numbers into hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book has 488 pages. So, the hundreds digit ranges from 1 to 4.\n\nI'll need to count how many times '4' and '8' appear in each place (hundreds, tens, units) across all 3-digit numbers from 100 to 488.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place:\n\n- For '4' in the hundreds place: This occurs in numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, '4' appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\n- For '8' in the hundreds place: Wait, the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. There's no page number with 8 in the hundreds place because the book only has 488 pages. So, '8' doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all in 3-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place in 3-digit numbers. The tens digit can be from 0 to 9, and the hundreds digit is from 1 to 4. So, for each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), I need to count how many times '4' and '8' appear in the tens place.\n\nLet's handle each hundreds group separately.\n\n1. Hundreds group 100-199:\n   - Tens digit can be 0-9, so for each tens digit, there are 10 numbers (units 0-9).\n   - '4' in the tens place: Numbers 140-149, which is 10 numbers, so '4' appears 10 times.\n   - '8' in the tens place: Numbers 180-189, which is 10 numbers, so '8' appears 10 times.\n\n2. Hundreds group 200-299:\n   - Similarly, '4' in tens place: 240-249 (10 numbers).\n   - '8' in tens place: 280-289 (10 numbers).\n\n3. Hundreds group 300-399:\n   - '4' in tens place: 340-349 (10 numbers).\n   - '8' in tens place: 380-389 (10 numbers).\n\n4. Hundreds group 400-488:\n   - Here, the tens digit can go up to 8 because 488 is the last page.\n   - '4' in tens place: 440-449. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers.\n   - '8' in tens place: 480-488. But wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (from 480 to 488 inclusive). So, '8' appears 9 times in the tens place here.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. From 480 to 488, the tens digit is '8', and the units digits go from 0 to 8, which is 9 numbers. So, '8' appears 9 times in the tens place for this group.\n\nSo, adding up the tens place counts for each hundreds group:\n\n- For '4' in tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 times.\n- For '8' in tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n\nWait, so '4' appears 40 times in the tens place across all 3-digit numbers, and '8' appears 39 times.\n\nNow, let's move on to the units place in 3-digit numbers. Again, I'll consider each hundreds group.\n\nIn each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), for each tens group (0-9), the units digit cycles from 0-9, so each digit appears once per tens group.\n\nSo, for each hundreds group, the number of times '4' appears in the units place is 10 (once for each tens group). Similarly for '8'.\n\nBut wait, for the last hundreds group, 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, so the units digits go up to 8 in the last tens group (480-488). So, in the tens group 480-488, the units digits are 0-8, which is 9 digits. So, in this case, the units digit '4' appears once (484) and '8' appears once (488). But wait, I'm considering units digits across all tens groups, so let me think carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate for each hundreds group:\n\n1. Hundreds group 100-199:\n   - For each tens group (0-9), the units digit cycles 0-9, so '4' appears once per tens group, and '8' appears once per tens group.\n   - There are 10 tens groups (0-9), so '4' appears 10 times, '8' appears 10 times.\n\n2. Hundreds group 200-299:\n   - Same as above: '4' appears 10 times, '8' appears 10 times.\n\n3. Hundreds group 300-399:\n   - Same: '4' appears 10 times, '8' appears 10 times.\n\n4. Hundreds group 400-488:\n   - Here, the tens digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page).\n   - For each tens group from 0 to 8, the units digit cycles 0-9 except in the last tens group (tens digit 8), where units digits go up to 8.\n   - So, for tens groups 0-7: Each has units digits 0-9, so '4' appears once per tens group, '8' appears once per tens group.\n   - For tens group 8: Units digits go from 0-8, so '4' appears once (at 484) and '8' appears once (at 488).\n   - So, total for '4' in units place: 8 tens groups (0-7) each contributing 1 '4' plus 1 '4' in tens group 8, totaling 9 times.\n   - Similarly, '8' in units place: 8 tens groups contributing 1 each, plus 1 in tens group 8, totaling 9 times.\n\nWait, but wait, in the hundreds group 400-488, the tens digits are from 0 to 8. So, for each tens group from 0 to 7, the units digits go from 0 to 9, so '4' and '8' each appear once per tens group. That's 8 times each. Then, for the tens group 8 (480-488), units digits go from 0 to 8, so '4' appears once (at 484) and '8' appears once (at 488). So, in total, '4' appears 8 + 1 = 9 times, and '8' appears 8 + 1 = 9 times in the units place for this hundreds group.\n\nSo, adding up across all hundreds groups:\n\n- '4' in units place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n- '8' in units place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because in the 400-488 group, the units digits for '4' and '8' are both 9 times, so adding to the previous 30, it's 39 each. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: for each of the first three hundreds groups (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each has 10 tens groups, each contributing one '4' and one '8' in the units place, so 10 each. For the last hundreds group, 400-488, we have 9 tens groups (0-8), but in the units place, each tens group from 0-7 contributes one '4' and one '8', and the 8th tens group (480-488) contributes one '4' and one '8'. So, that's 8*1 + 1 = 9 for each digit.\n\nSo, in total, '4' appears 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times in the units place, and '8' appears the same, 39 times.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit off because in the 400-488 group, the units digits go up to 8, so maybe I'm missing something. Wait, no, because for each tens group from 0-7, units digits go up to 9, so '4' and '8' are included. Only in the last tens group (8) do the units digits stop at 8, so '4' is included (at 484) and '8' is included (at 488). So, yes, 9 times each.\n\nSo, for 3-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: '4' appears 89 times, '8' appears 0 times.\n- Tens place: '4' appears 40 times, '8' appears 39 times.\n- Units place: '4' appears 39 times, '8' appears 39 times.\n\nAdding these up:\n\nTotal '4's in 3-digit numbers: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168 times.\nTotal '8's in 3-digit numbers: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78 times.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high, but let's check again.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so '4' appears 89 times there. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for '4', across all hundreds groups, we had 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 times. But wait, in the 400-488 group, the tens digit goes up to 8, so in the tens place, '4' appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nFor '8' in the tens place, in 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each has 10 numbers where '8' is in the tens place, and in 400-488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times. That's correct.\n\nIn the units place, for each hundreds group except the last, '4' and '8' each appear 10 times. In the last group, 400-488, they each appear 9 times, so 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 each. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total '4's in 3-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\nTotal '8's in 3-digit numbers: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nNow, let's not forget the 1-digit and 2-digit numbers.\n\nIn 1-digit numbers (1-9):\n- '4' appears once.\n- '8' appears once.\n\nIn 2-digit numbers (10-99):\n- '4' appears 19 times (as calculated earlier).\n- '8' appears 19 times.\n\nSo, adding up all digits:\n\nTotal '4's = 1 (1-digit) + 19 (2-digit) + 168 (3-digit) = 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nTotal '8's = 1 (1-digit) + 19 (2-digit) + 78 (3-digit) = 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems like a big difference. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in 3-digit numbers, '4's are 168 and '8's are 78. That seems correct based on the earlier breakdown.\n\nSo, total '4's: 188, total '8's: 98.\n\nTherefore, the number of '4's printed is 188 - 98 = 90 more than '8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me recalculate the 3-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so '4' appears 89 times.\n\n- Tens place:\n  - 100-199: 10 times '4' (140-149)\n  - 200-299: 10 times '4' (240-249)\n  - 300-399: 10 times '4' (340-349)\n  - 400-488: 10 times '4' (440-449)\n  So, 10+10+10+10=40 times '4'.\n\n- Units place:\n  - 100-199: 10 times '4' (e.g., 104, 114, ..., 194)\n  - 200-299: 10 times '4'\n  - 300-399: 10 times '4'\n  - 400-488: 9 times '4' (since units digits go up to 8 in the last tens group)\n  So, 10+10+10+9=39 times '4'.\n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 '4's in 3-digit numbers.\n\nFor '8's in 3-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0 times.\n\n- Tens place:\n  - 100-199: 10 times '8' (180-189)\n  - 200-299: 10 times '8' (280-289)\n  - 300-399: 10 times '8' (380-389)\n  - 400-488: 9 times '8' (480-488)\n  So, 10+10+10+9=39 times '8'.\n\n- Units place:\n  - 100-199: 10 times '8' (108, 118, ..., 198)\n  - 200-299: 10 times '8'\n  - 300-399: 10 times '8'\n  - 400-488: 9 times '8' (since units digits go up to 8 in the last tens group)\n  So, 10+10+10+9=39 times '8'.\n\nThus, '8's in 3-digit numbers: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nAdding the 1-digit and 2-digit counts:\n\n- '4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n- '8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think if I considered all the cases correctly.\n\nWait, in the 3-digit numbers, when considering the units place in 400-488, I accounted for 9 '4's and 9 '8's, which seems correct because the last tens group (480-488) only goes up to 488, so units digits go up to 8, hence '4' appears once (484) and '8' appears once (488).\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nAnother way to think about it: For each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), count how many times '4' and '8' appear.\n\nBut I think my approach is solid. So, the final answer should be 90 more '4's than '8's.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we need to count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places across all page numbers.\n\n1. **1-digit page numbers (1-9):**\n   - '4' appears once.\n   - '8' appears once.\n\n2. **2-digit page numbers (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:**\n     - '4' appears 10 times (40-49).\n     - '8' appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - **Units place:**\n     - '4' appears 9 times (14, 24, ..., 94).\n     - '8' appears 9 times (18, 28, ..., 98).\n   - Total for 2-digit numbers:\n     - '4' appears 19 times.\n     - '8' appears 19 times.\n\n3. **3-digit page numbers (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:**\n     - '4' appears 89 times (400-488).\n     - '8' does not appear.\n   - **Tens place:**\n     - '4' appears 10 times in each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), totaling 40 times.\n     - '8' appears 10 times in each of the first three hundreds groups and 9 times in 400-488, totaling 39 times.\n   - **Units place:**\n     - '4' appears 10 times in each of the first three hundreds groups and 9 times in 400-488, totaling 39 times.\n     - '8' appears 10 times in each of the first three hundreds groups and 9 times in 400-488, totaling 39 times.\n   - Total for 3-digit numbers:\n     - '4' appears 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168 times.\n     - '8' appears 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78 times.\n\n4. **Total counts:**\n   - '4' appears 1 (1-digit) + 19 (2-digit) + 168 (3-digit) = 188 times.\n   - '8' appears 1 (1-digit) + 19 (2-digit) + 78 (3-digit) = 98 times.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{90}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should understand the problem clearly. The book has pages numbered from 1 to 488, and each page number is printed once. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nHmm, so maybe I should start by considering each digit place separately: the units place and the tens place. Wait, but page numbers can also have hundreds place, right? Since 488 is a three-digit number, I should consider hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nLet me think about each digit place one by one.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many times does each digit from 0 to 9 appear in the units place?\n\nWell, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So for 488 pages, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. So there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 numbers (since 488 = 48*10 + 8).\n\nIn each complete block, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does the digit 8. So for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 and the number of 8's is also 48. But wait, in the partial block from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So in this partial block, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). So adding these, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So in the units place, both digits 4 and 8 appear 49 times each.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so when I do the units place, from 1 to 488, the units digits go up to 8 in the last partial block. So yes, both 4 and 8 appear once more in that partial block.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for every 100 numbers. So for example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, up to 9 for 90-99.\n\nSo, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred from 401-488.\n\nIn each complete hundred, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So for each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8. So for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 times each.\n\nNow, in the partial hundred from 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. Wait, let me check: 401-410 has tens digit 0, 411-420 has 1, ..., 481-490 would have 8, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digits go up to 8. So in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? It's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, in 401-488, 440-449 is within that range, right? So that's 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, 480 is included, so that's 9 times. Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 9 numbers. Wait, but 480 is part of the 401-488 range, so the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times, because 480 is included.\n\nWait, let me confirm: from 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-490). But since we're stopping at 488, the last group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers, not 10. So in the tens place, the digit 8 appears 8 times in the partial hundred. Hmm, but wait, 480 is part of the 401-488 range, right? So 480 is in the 480-489 range, but since our book ends at 488, 480 is included, so the tens digit 8 starts at 480 and goes up to 488, which is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. Wait, that's 9 numbers, so the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the partial hundred.\n\nWait, no, let me count: 480 is the first number with tens digit 8, then 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers, so the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the partial hundred.\n\nSimilarly, the digit 4 appears in the tens place from 440 to 449, which is 10 numbers. So in the partial hundred, digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo total in the tens place: digit 4 appears 4*10 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from partial hundred) = 50 times. Digit 8 appears 4*10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me double-check: each complete hundred has 10 times each digit in the tens place, so 4 hundreds give 40 each. Then in the partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 times. So yes, 40+10=50 for 4, and 40+9=49 for 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place?\n\nFor digit 4, it's from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nFor digit 8, does it appear in the hundreds place? Well, in the hundreds place, digits go from 1 to 4, since the book ends at 488. So the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, the digit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is correct, and before that, it's 1, 2, 3. So yes, digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, summarizing the hundreds place: digit 4 appears 89 times, digit 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's add up all the occurrences of 4 and 8 across units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nNow for digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, so total 4's are 188, and total 8's are 98. So the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big difference.\n\nWait, let's go through each place again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. So 488 / 10 = 48 full groups, each contributing 1 to 4 and 8. Then the last partial group is 481-488, which has units digits 1-8. So in units place, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach complete hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So 4 complete hundreds give 4*10=40 for each digit. Then in the partial hundred 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 times. So 40+10=50 for 4, and 40+9=49 for 8. That adds up correctly.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly 400-488 have hundreds digit 4, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place, so 0 times. That's correct.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I feel like that might be too high. Let me think again. Maybe I overcounted somewhere.\n\nWait, in the units place, from 1 to 488, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place, and then in the last partial group, 481-488, digits 1-8 appear once each. So 48 + 1 = 49 for 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, each complete hundred gives 10 times each digit, so 4*10=40. Then in the partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 times. So 40+10=50 for 4, 40+9=49 for 8. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times for 4, none for 8. Correct.\n\nSo 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, which is correct.\n\nYes, I think that's right. So the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place (488 / 10 = 48 full groups).\n   - In the last partial group (481-488), 4 and 8 each appear once.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in each complete hundred (4 complete hundreds contribute 40 each).\n   - In the partial hundred (401-488), 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Digit 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 times.\n   - Digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that each page number from 1 to 488 is printed once. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nMaybe I should break this down by looking at each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds. That way, I can count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place and then sum them up.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, in each block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, in each block of 10, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra pages (from 481 to 488). In each complete block, we have one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 and the number of 8's is also 48.\n\nBut wait, in the incomplete block from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this incomplete block, the digit 8 appears once in the units place (page 488). There's no 4 in the units place here because the units digits go up to 8, so 4 doesn't appear. Therefore, for the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 and the total number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. From 1 to 480, there are 48 blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so that's 48 each. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in the units place, we have a 4 on page 484 and an 8 on page 488. So, that's one more 4 and one more 8 in the units place. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, so actually, both 4's and 8's have 49 occurrences in the units place. So, no difference there.\n\nWait, but I thought 488 is the last page, so maybe I should count up to 488 inclusive. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete tens are there? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete tens and 8 extra pages. So, in the units place, each complete ten has one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, in the extra 8 pages, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, same number of 4's and 8's in the units place.\n\nOkay, moving on to the tens place. In the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in a block of 100. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the digit 8 appears 10 times as well.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an incomplete block from 401-488.\n\nIn each complete block of 100, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 4 times 10 is 40 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times in each block, so 4 blocks give 40 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, in the incomplete block from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). Let's break it down:\n\n- Pages 401-409: tens digit is 0\n- Pages 410-419: tens digit is 1\n- Pages 420-429: tens digit is 2\n- Pages 430-439: tens digit is 3\n- Pages 440-449: tens digit is 4\n- Pages 450-459: tens digit is 5\n- Pages 460-469: tens digit is 6\n- Pages 470-479: tens digit is 7\n- Pages 480-488: tens digit is 8\n\nSo, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in pages 440-449, which is 10 times. The digit 8 appears in pages 480-488, which is 9 times (since 488 is the last page, so from 480 to 488 is 9 pages: 480,481,...,488).\n\nWait, no, actually, the tens digit is 8 from 480 to 488, which is 9 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in this incomplete block.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in the tens place: 40 (from complete blocks) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50.\n\nTotal 8's in the tens place: 40 (from complete blocks) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times. That's a difference of 1 more 4 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit cycles every 1000 pages, but since our book is only 488 pages, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nFrom 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's here.\n\nFrom 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, again no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so every page from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, how many pages are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nThe digit 8 in the hundreds place would require pages from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times and 8's appear 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8: 48 each.\n- In the incomplete block (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 +1 = 49 for 4's and 48 +1 = 49 for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- 4 complete blocks of 100, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's: 40 each.\n- In the incomplete block (401-488), 4's in tens place: 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 4's.\n- 8's in tens place: 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 8's.\nTotal 4's in tens place: 40 +10 =50\nTotal 8's in tens place:40 +9=49\nDifference here is 1 more 4.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 400-488: 89 pages, so 89 4's.\n- No 8's in hundreds place.\nSo, 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nAdding up:\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98\nDifference:188 -98=90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nAnd in the tens place, 4's: 50, 8's:49. Units place: both 49.\n\nSo, yeah, the total 4's are 188, 8's are 98, difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit surprised because I thought maybe the difference would be smaller, but 90 seems high. Let me check another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately and see if I get the same numbers.\n\nCalculating total 4's:\n- Units place: as before, 49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal:49+50+89=188\n\nCalculating total 8's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal:49+49=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nYes, same result. So, I think that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Hmm, let's see. I think I should break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how page numbers are structured. Each page number is a number from 1 to 488. So, I'm looking at all the numbers from 1 up to 488, and I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nMaybe I should tackle each digit position separately\u2014units place and tens place. Wait, but 488 is a three-digit number, so I might also need to consider the hundreds place. Let me think.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, from 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. Similarly, from 11-20, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0 again. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 appears once as well.\n\nNow, how many such sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in the units place, each digit 4 and 8 will appear 48 times from the full sets. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). So, total units place counts:\n\n4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\nSo, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nNext, let's move to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8.\n\nNow, how many hundreds do we have in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nIn each full hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4 full hundreds would give 4*10=40 times for 4's in the tens place. Similarly, 8's would also appear 10 times per hundred, so 40 times for 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, but wait, 401-488: the tens digit cycles as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0\n- 411-420: tens digit 1\n- 421-430: tens digit 2\n- 431-440: tens digit 3\n- 441-450: tens digit 4\n- 451-460: tens digit 5\n- 461-470: tens digit 6\n- 471-480: tens digit 7\n- 481-490: tens digit 8 (but we stop at 488)\n\nSo, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 more times for 4's in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, that's 8 numbers (481-488). So, the digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, total tens place counts:\n\n4's: 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50\n8's: 40 (from full hundreds) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 48 times. The difference here is 2 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. For pages 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, which we can ignore since we're only considering digits 4 and 8.\n\nFrom 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299 it's 2; 300-399 it's 3; 400-488 it's 4.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nThe digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, and the hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488, and before that, it's 1, 2, 3. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo, hundreds place counts:\n\n4's: 89\n8's: 0\n\nDifference here is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let's add up all the counts.\n\nUnits place:\n4's: 49\n8's: 49\n\nTens place:\n4's: 50\n8's: 48\n\nHundreds place:\n4's: 89\n8's: 0\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nEach 10 numbers, 1 four and 1 eight. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1 to both 4 and 8. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units: 48 + 1 = 49 each.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds: 40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450 (10 times), and 8 appears in 481-488 (8 times). So, 4's: 40 +10=50; 8's:40 +8=48.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours. No eights.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\nTotal 8's:49 +48 +0=97\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 91.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488, and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by understanding how digits are distributed in page numbers. Page numbers can be 1-digit, 2-digit, or 3-digit numbers. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers are:\n\n- 1 to 9: 1-digit numbers\n- 10 to 99: 2-digit numbers\n- 100 to 488: 3-digit numbers\n\nI think I should break down the counting of 4's and 8's into these three ranges to make it easier.\n\nStarting with the 1-digit page numbers: 1 to 9.\n\nIn this range, the digits 4 and 8 each appear exactly once, right? So, for 1-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 occur once each.\n\nNow moving on to 2-digit numbers: 10 to 99.\n\nHere, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I'll need to consider both places separately for each digit.\n\nLet's start with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 9 times in the 2-digit numbers. Wait, no, actually, from 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers, so each digit appears 9 times in the units place. So, for 4, that's 9 times, and for 8, that's also 9 times.\n\nNow, for the tens place. The tens digit cycles from 1 to 9, each appearing 10 times. So, for the digit 4, it appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89).\n\nSo, in 2-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears 9 (units) + 10 (tens) = 19 times, and the same for 8: 9 + 10 = 19 times.\n\nWait, but wait a second, from 10 to 99, the tens digit is from 1 to 9, each appearing 10 times, so yes, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. And in the units place, each digit appears 9 times, so 4 and 8 each appear 9 times there. So, yes, 19 times each in 2-digit numbers.\n\nSo, so far, for 1-digit and 2-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 have been counted 1 (from 1-digit) + 19 (from 2-digit) = 20 times each.\n\nNow, moving on to 3-digit numbers: 100 to 488.\n\nThis is where it might get a bit more complicated because we have a 3-digit range that doesn't go all the way up to 999, but only up to 488. So, I need to be careful with the hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nLet me break it down by each digit place: hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because 488 is the last page. So, let's see:\n\n- Hundreds digit is 1: 100-199\n- Hundreds digit is 2: 200-299\n- Hundreds digit is 3: 300-399\n- Hundreds digit is 4: 400-488\n\nI need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds, tens, and units places for each of these ranges.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place:\n\n- For hundreds digit 4: 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because 800-899 would be beyond 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all in 3-digit numbers here.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, moving to the tens place in 3-digit numbers.\n\nAgain, let's break it down by hundreds:\n\n1. Hundreds digit 1: 100-199. The tens digit can be 0-9, each appearing 10 times per hundred. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9, each appearing 10 times. So, in the tens place for 100-199, the digit 4 appears 10 times (140-149), and 8 appears 10 times (180-189).\n\n2. Hundreds digit 2: 200-299. Similarly, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (240-249), and 8 appears 10 times (280-289).\n\n3. Hundreds digit 3: 300-399. Again, tens digit 4 appears 10 times (340-349), and 8 appears 10 times (380-389).\n\n4. Hundreds digit 4: 400-488. Now, here, the tens digit can go from 0 to 8 because 488 is the last page. So, for the tens digit, the digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 488 is the last page, so the tens digit goes up to 8. So, 440-449 is within 400-488, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place here.\n\nSimilarly, the digit 8 in the tens place would be in 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 is the last page. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here, not 10 times.\n\nWait, let me check that again. When the hundreds digit is 4, and the tens digit is 8, the numbers would be 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place for the hundreds digit 4.\n\nSo, summarizing the tens place:\n\n- For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: each contributes 10 times for both 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n- For hundreds digit 4: 4 contributes 10 times, 8 contributes 9 times.\n\nSo, total for the tens place:\n\n- 4's: 3 hundreds * 10 = 30, plus 10 from hundreds digit 4, so total 40 times.\n- 8's: 3 hundreds * 10 = 30, plus 9 from hundreds digit 4, so total 39 times.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, for hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, each contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place. So, that's 3 * 10 = 30 for 4 and 30 for 8.\n\nThen, for hundreds digit 4:\n\n- 4 in tens place: 10 times (440-449)\n- 8 in tens place: 9 times (480-488)\n\nSo, total for tens place:\n\n- 4's: 30 + 10 = 40\n- 8's: 30 + 9 = 39\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in 3-digit numbers.\n\nAgain, breaking it down by hundreds digit:\n\n1. Hundreds digit 1: 100-199. For each tens digit, the units digit cycles 0-9, so for each tens group, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and 8 appears once. Since there are 10 tens groups (0-9), each digit appears 10 times in the units place.\n\nSo, for 100-199, units place: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\n2. Hundreds digit 2: 200-299. Same logic: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times in the units place.\n\n3. Hundreds digit 3: 300-399. Similarly, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\n4. Hundreds digit 4: 400-488. Now, here, the units digit can go from 0-9 for each tens digit, but the tens digits go up to 8 because 488 is the last page. So, how many numbers are there here? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers as calculated earlier.\n\nBut for the units place, for each tens digit, the units digit cycles 0-9. However, when the tens digit is 8, the units digit only goes up to 8, because 488 is the last page. So, for tens digits 0-7, the units digits go from 0-9, so 4 appears once per tens group, and 8 appears once per tens group. But for tens digit 8, units digits go from 0-8, so 4 appears once (at 484), and 8 appears once (at 488). Wait, no, wait: when the tens digit is 8, the units digits go from 0-8, so 4 would appear at 484, which is within 480-488, and 8 would appear at 488, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included.\n\nWait, but let me think again. For each tens group, the units digits go from 0-9 except for the last tens group, which is 8, where units go only up to 8.\n\nSo, for hundreds digit 4:\n\n- Tens digits 0-7: each has units digits 0-9, so 4 appears once per tens group (total 8 tens groups * 1 = 8 times)\n- Tens digit 8: units digits 0-8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488).\n\nWait, but wait, no: for each tens group from 0 to 7, there are 10 units digits, so 4 appears once in each, so 8 times (tens 0-7) * 1 = 8. Then, for tens 8, units digits 0-8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, total for units place in hundreds digit 4:\n\n- 4's: 8 + 1 = 9 times\n- 8's: 8 + 1 = 9 times\n\nWait, but wait, that doesn't seem right. Because for each tens group from 0 to 7, units digits 0-9, so 4 appears once per tens group, so 8 times. Then, for tens group 8, units digits 0-8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, yes, 4 appears 8 + 1 = 9 times, and 8 appears 8 + 1 = 9 times in the units place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nWait, but that seems inconsistent because in the hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, each had 10 times for both 4 and 8 in the units place, but for hundreds digit 4, it's only 9 times each. Hmm, that seems correct because the last tens group is cut short.\n\nSo, summarizing the units place:\n\n- Hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: each contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8.\n- Hundreds digit 4: contributes 9 times for 4 and 9 times for 8.\n\nSo, total units place:\n\n- 4's: 3 * 10 + 9 = 39\n- 8's: 3 * 10 + 9 = 39\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place in 3-digit numbers.\n\nFirst, hundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89 (from hundreds digit 4)\n- 8's: 0\n\nTens place:\n\n- 4's: 40\n- 8's: 39\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 4's: 39\n- 8's: 39\n\nSo, total for 3-digit numbers:\n\n- 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n- 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 for 4, 0 for 8\n- Tens place: 40 for 4, 39 for 8\n- Units place: 39 for 4, 39 for 8\n\nSo, total 4's in 3-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\nTotal 8's in 3-digit numbers: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nNow, let me add up all the counts from 1-digit, 2-digit, and 3-digit numbers.\n\nFirst, 1-digit numbers:\n\n- 4's: 1\n- 8's: 1\n\n2-digit numbers:\n\n- 4's: 19\n- 8's: 19\n\n3-digit numbers:\n\n- 4's: 168\n- 8's: 78\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nWait, let me add them up:\n\n4's:\n\n1 (1-digit) + 19 (2-digit) + 168 (3-digit) = 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 168 = 188\n\n8's:\n\n1 (1-digit) + 19 (2-digit) + 78 (3-digit) = 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 78 = 98\n\nSo, total 4's printed: 188\nTotal 8's printed: 98\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's:\n\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\nWait, that seems like a lot, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 1-digit numbers: 1 each, correct.\n\n2-digit numbers:\n\n- Units place: 9 each\n- Tens place: 10 each\nTotal: 19 each, correct.\n\n3-digit numbers:\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89 (from 400-488)\n- 8's: 0\n\nTens place:\n\n- 4's: 40\n- 8's: 39\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 4's: 39\n- 8's: 39\n\nSo, 4's in 3-digit: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n8's in 3-digit: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nAdding up all:\n\n4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about whether I counted correctly in the 3-digit units place. For hundreds digit 4, units place:\n\n- For tens digits 0-7: each has 10 units digits, so 4 appears once per tens group, 8 times.\n- For tens digit 8: units digits 0-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n\nSo, 8 + 1 = 9 for 4's and 8 + 1 = 9 for 8's in units place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place for hundreds digit 4, 4's: 10 times (440-449), and 8's: 9 times (480-488).\n\nYes, that's correct because 480-488 is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, all the counts seem accurate.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is 188, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I guess I should consider all the page numbers from 1 to 488 and count how many times the digit 4 appears and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense.\n\nBut counting each digit one by one would take too long, especially since there are 488 pages. I need a smarter way to count the occurrences of 4 and 8 without checking each number individually.\n\nLet me break it down by the number of digits in the page numbers. Page numbers can be 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit, or 4-digit numbers. Wait, but 488 is a 3-digit number, so the page numbers go up to 3 digits. So, I can consider units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\nI think the best way is to analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both 4 and 8 and then sum up their occurrences.\n\nLet's start with the units place. For each digit from 0 to 9, each digit appears equally in the units place over a range of numbers. Since there are 488 pages, let me see how many complete groups of 10 there are.\n\n488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and 8 extra numbers. In each group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears once. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 times 1 plus 1 if the extra numbers include a 4. Similarly for 8's.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The last group is from 481 to 488, right? So the units digits in this last group go from 1 to 8. So, does the digit 4 appear in the units place here? Yes, at 484. So, in the units place, 4 appears once in each group of 10, and since there are 48 complete groups plus one more occurrence in the last partial group, that's 48 + 1 = 49 times for 4.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, in each group of 10, 8 appears once. In the last group, 488 is the last page, so the units digit 8 appears at 488. So, that's 48 times in complete groups plus 1 in the last group, totaling 49 times for 8 as well. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nHmm, interesting. Now, let's move on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. So, for example, from 0-99, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. Then, this repeats every 100 numbers.\n\nSo, let's see. The total number of pages is 488, which is 4*100 + 88. So, there are 4 complete hundreds and an extra 88 pages. So, for the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in each hundred. So, in 400 pages, each digit appears 4*10 = 40 times in the tens place. Now, for the extra 88 pages, which are from 401 to 488, let's see how the tens digit behaves.\n\nFrom 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles through 0 to 9 ten times each, but since we're only going up to 488, let's see. Wait, 401-409: tens digit is 0. 410-419: tens digit is 1. 420-429: tens digit is 2. 430-439: tens digit is 3. 440-449: tens digit is 4. 450-459: tens digit is 5. 460-469: tens digit is 6. 470-479: tens digit is 7. 480-488: tens digit is 8.\n\nSo, from 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except for the last one, which is 8 and appears 9 times because 488 is the end. Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here.\n\nWait, let me count again. From 401 to 488, how many numbers? 488 - 400 = 88, so 88 numbers. The tens digits go from 0 (401-410, but wait, 401-410 is 10 numbers, but 401 is the first, so 401-410 would be 10 numbers, right? Wait, 401 to 410 is 10 numbers, but 410 is included. Hmm, maybe it's better to think in terms of each tens group.\n\nSo, each tens group from 400-499 would have 10 numbers per tens digit, but since we only go up to 488, the last tens group is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens digit, in the extra 88 numbers (401-488), the digits 0 through 7 each appear 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, let me check that. From 400 to 488, the tens digits would be:\n\n- 400-409: tens digit 0 (10 numbers)\n- 410-419: tens digit 1 (10 numbers)\n- 420-429: tens digit 2 (10 numbers)\n- 430-439: tens digit 3 (10 numbers)\n- 440-449: tens digit 4 (10 numbers)\n- 450-459: tens digit 5 (10 numbers)\n- 460-469: tens digit 6 (10 numbers)\n- 470-479: tens digit 7 (10 numbers)\n- 480-488: tens digit 8 (9 numbers)\n\nSo, yes, each tens digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times in the extra 88 numbers.\n\nSo, for the tens place, the total number of times 4 appears is 4*10 (from the first 400 pages) plus 10 times in the 440-449 group in the extra 88 pages. Wait, no, wait. Actually, in the first 400 pages, each tens digit from 0-9 appears 40 times (4*10). Then, in the extra 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449). So, total for 4 in tens place is 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place, in the first 400 pages, each digit appears 40 times, so 8 appears 40 times. Then, in the extra 88 pages, 8 appears 9 times (from 480-488). So, total for 8 in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. So, the difference here is 50 - 49 = 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, 400-488 is part of the 400s, so the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, but since we don't print leading zeros, the hundreds digit doesn't appear. So, for the hundreds place, digits start appearing from page 100 onwards.\n\nSo, for pages 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0 and not printed, so we can ignore it. From 100-199, hundreds digit is 1. From 200-299, it's 2. From 300-399, it's 3. From 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in the given range up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. The highest hundreds digit is 4, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. The difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's than 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences for each digit place.\n\nFirst, units place: 49 times for 4, 49 times for 8. Difference: 0.\n\nTens place: 50 times for 4, 49 times for 8. Difference: 1.\n\nHundreds place: 89 times for 4, 0 times for 8. Difference: 89.\n\nSo, total difference is 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place:\n- Each group of 10 has one 4 and one 8 in units place.\n- There are 48 complete groups of 10 in 480 pages, and then 8 more pages (481-488).\n- In the units place, 4 appears once in each group, so 48 times, plus once more in 484, so 49 times.\n- Similarly, 8 appears once in each group, so 48 times, plus once in 488, so 49 times.\n- So, units place: 49 vs 49, difference 0. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n- First 400 pages: 4 complete hundreds, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in tens place, so 4*10 = 40 times for each digit.\n- Extra 88 pages (401-488):\n  - Tens digits go from 0 to 8.\n  - Each digit 0-7 appears 10 times (e.g., 400-409: 10 numbers, but since we're starting from 401, maybe it's 9? Wait, no, 401-410 is 10 numbers, but 410 is included, so 401-410 has tens digit 0 for 10 numbers.\n  - Wait, but 401-410 is 10 numbers, but 401 is the first, so 401-410 is 10 numbers, right? So, each tens digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times (480-488 is 9 numbers).\n- So, for 4 in tens place: 40 (from first 400) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50.\n- For 8 in tens place: 40 (from first 400) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49.\n- Difference: 50 - 49 = 1. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, not printed.\n- 100-199: hundreds digit 1, 100 times.\n- 200-299: hundreds digit 2, 100 times.\n- 300-399: hundreds digit 3, 100 times.\n- 400-488: hundreds digit 4, 89 times (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n- So, 4 appears 89 times, 8 never appears. So, difference 89. Correct.\n\nAdding up the differences: 0 (units) +1 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused about the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times the hundreds digit is 4. That seems right.\n\nWait, another way to check: 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So yes, 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal number of 8's is 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that's consistent with the earlier calculation. So, the number of 4's is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting Digits in Each Place:**\n   - We analyze the units, tens, and hundreds places separately for digits 4 and 8.\n\n2. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total groups of 10 in 488 pages: 48 complete groups and 8 extra numbers.\n   - **4's:** 48 groups \u00d7 1 + 1 (from 484) = 49.\n   - **8's:** 48 groups \u00d7 1 + 1 (from 488) = 49.\n   - Difference in units place: 0.\n\n3. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - First 400 pages: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 times each.\n   - Extra 88 pages (401-488):\n     - **4's:** 10 times (440-449).\n     - **8's:** 9 times (480-488).\n   - **Total 4's:** 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - **Total 8's:** 40 + 9 = 49.\n   - Difference in tens place: 1.\n\n4. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 1-99: No hundreds digit.\n   - Pages 100-399: Hundreds digits 1, 2, 3 each appear 100 times.\n   - Pages 400-488: Hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n   - **4's:** 89.\n   - **8's:** 0.\n   - Difference in hundreds place: 89.\n\n5. **Total Difference:**\n   - Units: 0\n   - Tens: 1\n   - Hundreds: 89\n   - **Total:** 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that each page number is printed once, starting from 1 and ending at 488. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me break it down by the places where digits can appear: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll handle each place separately for both digits.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place**: The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the 48th set of 10 pages would end at 480, and then we have pages 481 to 488. In page 484, the units digit is 4, so that's one more. So total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place**: The digit 4 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically from 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block of 100 pages contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial block from 401-488. Each full block gives 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 blocks give 4*10 = 40. Now, in the partial block 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for pages 401-409, which is 9 pages. So total tens place 4's would be 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488. That's 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive). Each of these pages has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 49 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So there are 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8:\n\n1. **Units place**: Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. But wait, page 488 ends with an 8, so that's an extra one. So units place 8's would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place**: The digit 8 appears in the tens place from 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block of 100 pages contributes 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. There are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block 401-488. Each full block gives 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10 = 40. In the partial block, the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488). So total tens place 8's would be 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So hundreds place 8's = 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nFor 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 pages, correct. For units place, 488/10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, and then one more in 484, so 49. Similarly for tens place, 4 blocks of 100, each giving 10 4's, so 40, and then 401-409 gives 9 more, totaling 49. So 49 + 49 + 89 = 187.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, and 488 adds another, so 49. Tens place: 4 blocks of 100, each giving 10 8's, so 40, and then 480-488 gives 9 more, so 49. Hundreds place: 0. So 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSubtracting, 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, that seems correct. So the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 89 more 4's.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds. Because the number of times a digit appears in each place can be calculated independently, and then I can add them up for each digit (4 and 8) and compare the totals.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in a sequence of numbers. Since the book has 488 pages, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and a partial group of 8 numbers (from 481 to 488). In each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears once. So, for the units place, each digit (4 and 8) appears 48 times. But wait, in the partial group from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so the digit 8 appears once more. So, for the units place, 4 appears 48 times and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because in the partial group, the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once. So, units place: 4's = 48, 8's = 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, but hold on, when the total number is 488, the last page is 488, so the units digits go from 1 to 8 in the last partial group. So yes, 8 appears once more in the units place, making it 49 times for 8 and 48 times for 4 in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers, right? So, for each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8.\n\nSince there are 4 hundreds in 488 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488), wait, actually, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So, from 1 to 400, there are 4 complete hundreds. Each hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place. So, for 4, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times, and similarly for 8, 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in this range, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? From 440-449, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 times. Similarly, does 8 appear in the tens place? From 480-488, the tens digit is 8, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, no, actually, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, so that's 9 times? Wait, no, 480 to 489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (from 440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (from 480-488).\n\nSo, total in the tens place: 4's = 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50 times. 8's = 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49 times.\n\nWait, but wait, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, for the 400-488 range, the tens digits are 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit, how many numbers? From 401-488, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which appears 9 times because 488 is the end. So, for tens digit 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. For tens digit 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times in the last partial hundred. So, total for tens place: 4's = 40 +10=50, 8's=40 +9=49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. Wait, no, the hundreds digit is 1 for 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, and 4 for 300-399 and 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 300-399, that's 100 numbers, so 100 times, and from 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, total for 4 in hundreds place is 100 +89=189 times.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the hundreds digit is 3 for 300-399, which is 100 numbers, so 100 times. The hundreds digit is 4 for 400-488, which is 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place for 400-488. So, total 4's in hundreds place: 89 times.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me clarify. The hundreds digit is 1 for 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, and 4 for 300-399 and 400-488. So, for 300-399, the hundreds digit is 3, not 4. So, 4 in the hundreds place starts at 400. So, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but I think I confused myself. Let me think again. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, and 4 for 300-399 and 400-488. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 300-399 would have hundreds digit 3, and 400-488 would have hundreds digit 4. So, the hundreds digit is 4 only in 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, because 800 is beyond 488. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but that can't be right. Wait, 488 is less than 800, so the hundreds digit only goes up to 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: from 1-99, hundreds digit is 0 or 1? Wait, actually, in page numbers, page 1 is just '1', so the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99. So, the hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place because 800 is beyond 488. So, 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, now, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor digit 4:\n- Units place: 48 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's: 48 +50 +89 = 187 times.\n\nFor digit 8:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's: 49 +49 +0 = 98 times.\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check the units place for 4's. Earlier, I thought units place for 4's was 48, but let me confirm.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many such numbers are there? The last one is 484, which is 484=4+10*(n-1), so n= (484-4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48 +1=49. Wait, that's 49 times. But earlier I thought 48 times. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me recalculate. The units digit cycles every 10, so in 488 numbers, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 complete groups, each contributing 1 occurrence of 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 doesn't appear. So, total 4's in units place: 48 times.\n\nWait, but earlier when I used the formula, I got 49. So, which is correct? Let's list them: 4,14,24,...,484. So, from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48 +1=49. So, that suggests 49 times. But according to the grouping, it's 48 complete groups, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in the last group, which has 8 numbers, none have 4 in units place, so total 48. Hmm, contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then 14, 24,..., 484. So, 484 is the last one. So, how many terms? It's (484 -4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, that's 49 times. But when I think in terms of complete groups, 488/10=48.8, so 48 complete groups, each with one 4, so 48, and then in the last group (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so no 4. So, total 48. But the formula suggests 49. Which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is correct because 484 is included, which is the 49th occurrence. So, in 488 numbers, the number of times 4 appears in units place is 49. So, I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought it was 48. So, units place for 4's is 49 times, and for 8's, as earlier, it's 49 times as well because in the last group, 488 is included, so units digit 8 appears once more, making it 49.\n\nWait, but let me check 8's in units place. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8,18,28,...,488. So, how many terms? (488 -8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 times. So, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place. So, that's correct.\n\nEarlier, I thought 4's in units place was 48, but it's actually 49. So, I must have made a mistake in my initial calculation.\n\nSo, correcting that:\n\nUnits place:\n- 4's: 49\n- 8's: 49\n\nTens place:\n- 4's: 50\n- 8's: 49\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 +50 +89=188\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place counts.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4's: from 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 times, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total 4's in tens place:40 +10=50.\n\nFor 8's in tens place: from 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 times, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 times. So, total 8's in tens place:40 +9=49.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\n4's: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\n8's: 0 times, as discussed.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98\n\nDifference:188 -98=90\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's in units place was 49, but in the initial problem, I thought it was 48. So, I had a miscalculation there, but now corrected it to 49.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't miss anything else.\n\nWait, another way to calculate the number of times a digit appears is to consider each position separately and calculate how many times the digit appears in each position.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10)=48, plus if the last digit is >=4, add 1. Since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's: floor(488/10)=48, plus if last digit >=8, add 1. Since 488 mod10=8, which is equal to 8, so 48 +1=49.\n\nFor tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100)=4, each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40. Then, check the last partial hundred: 488 mod100=88, so the tens digit goes up to 8. Since 4 <=8, add 10 if the tens digit in the partial part is >=4. Wait, no, the formula is a bit different. The number of times 4 appears in the tens place is:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds:4, each contributing 10 times, so 40.\n\nThen, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The number of times 4 appears in the tens place is 10 (from 440-449). So, total 40 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds:4, each contributing 10 times, so 40.\n\nIn the last partial hundred, the tens digit goes up to 8, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, total 40 +9=49.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears: floor(488/1000)=0, but since we're dealing with 3-digit numbers, it's better to think of it as the hundreds digit.\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in hundreds place: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\n8's in hundreds place: 0 times, as 800>488.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the numbers are from 1 to 488, which includes numbers like 1, 2, ..., 9 (single digits), then 10 to 99 (two digits), and then 100 to 488 (three digits).\n\nNow, the problem is about counting how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears, then subtracting the two to find the difference.\n\nI think I should tackle this by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. That way, I can count the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each position and sum them up.\n\nLet's start with the units place. For each group of ten consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in every block of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. For example, in 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0, so 4 is in 4 and 8 is in 8. So, in each block of ten, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place.\n\nNow, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks of ten and then a partial block of 8 pages (since 488 = 48*10 + 8). So, in the units place, for each complete block, both 4 and 8 appear once. So, 48 times each. Then, in the partial block (pages 481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial block, 4 appears once (page 484) and 8 appears once (page 488). So, adding these, units place gives 48 + 1 = 49 times for 4 and 48 + 1 = 49 times for 8. Wait, that can't be right because the partial block only goes up to 8, so 484 is included, but 488 is the last page. Hmm, but wait, 488 is page 488, so the units digit is 8, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check. The last page is 488, so the units digits in the partial block (481-488) would be 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, yes, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, units place: 49 times for 4 and 49 times for 8.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I did that correctly. Let me think again. The total number of units digits is 488, so the number of complete tens is 48, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4 and 48 +1 =49 for 8. So, same count so far.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49), and the same for 8 (e.g., 80-89). So, in each hundred, 10 occurrences for 4 and 10 for 8.\n\nHow many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488). Wait, actually, 488 is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages in the 401-488 range. So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times. So, 4 hundreds give 4*10=40 for 4 and 4*10=40 for 8.\n\nNow, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is 4-8-8). So, the tens digits in this partial hundred are 0 (for 401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), and 8 (481-488). Wait, but 488 is included, so the tens digit 8 appears in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in the tens place for this partial hundred, how many times does 4 and 8 appear?\n\nFor 4 in the tens place: It's from 441-450, which is 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, 441-450 is entirely within 401-488, so 10 times.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place: It's from 481-490, but we only go up to 488, so that's 8 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in this partial hundred.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in the tens place, each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit, but in the partial hundred, it's only 8 for 8. So, in the tens place, for 488 pages, how does that work?\n\nWait, let me clarify. The partial hundred is from 401 to 488, which is 88 pages. The tens digits in this range go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, for each tens digit, how many times does it appear?\n\nFor 4 in the tens place: 441-450, which is 10 pages (441 to 450). Since 450 is less than 488, that's fine, so 10 times.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place: 481-488, which is 8 pages (481 to 488), so 8 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place for the partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nTherefore, total in the tens place: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40 for 4, plus 10 in the partial hundred, so 50 for 4. Similarly, 4 hundreds *10=40 for 8, plus 8 in the partial hundred, so 48 for 8.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 48 times.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Each full hundred has 10 times each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 4*10=40 for 4 and 4*10=40 for 8. Then, in the partial hundred (401-488), 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, total tens place: 40+10=50 for 4, and 40+8=48 for 8.\n\nOkay, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit doesn't go up to 8 because 800 is beyond 488. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences.\n\nFor 4:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal for 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate that. 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nFor 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 48 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal for 8: 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- Each ten has one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n- 488 pages mean 48 full tens and 8 pages in the last partial ten.\n- So, 48*1=48 for each, plus 1 each in the partial ten (484 and 488), so 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place.\n- 4 full hundreds: 4*10=40 each.\n- Partial hundred (401-488):\n  - 4 in tens place: 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times.\n  - 8 in tens place: 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times.\n- So, total tens place: 40+10=50 for 4, 40+8=48 for 8. That adds up.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n- 8 doesn't appear in hundreds place in this book.\n\nTotal for 4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal for 8: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but I feel like that might be correct, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in the tens place for the partial hundred? Because in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but for each tens digit, how many times does it appear? For example, in 401-410, the tens digit is 0, so that's 10 pages. Similarly, 411-420 is tens digit 1, another 10 pages, and so on up to 471-480, which is tens digit 7, another 10 pages, and then 481-488, which is tens digit 8, 8 pages.\n\nSo, in the tens place, for each digit from 0 to 7, it appears 10 times, and for 8, it appears 8 times. So, for 4 in the tens place, it's in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so that's correct. For 8, it's in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: the partial hundred (401-488) has 88 pages. The tens digit cycles through 0-8. Each digit from 0-7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times. So, for each digit, except 8, it's 10 times. So, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but another thought: when considering the tens place, is it possible that in the hundreds beyond 400, the tens digit 4 appears more times? Let me think. From 400-488, the tens digit cycles 0-8, but for each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, in 400-488, which is almost a full hundred, it's 10 times for 4 in the tens place, as I calculated.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place, it's only 8 times because we don't reach 490.\n\nSo, I think my counts are accurate.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 97, so 188 - 97 = 91. So, there are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think if I missed any other digit positions or if there's any overlap I didn't consider. For example, in the hundreds place, 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 times, correct. 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Units and tens are correctly counted as above.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of ten numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - 48 full blocks of ten: 48 each.\n   - Partial block (481-488): 4 appears once (484), 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total: 49 each.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes ten 4's and ten 8's in the tens place.\n   - 4 full hundreds: 40 each.\n   - Partial hundred (401-488):\n     - 4 appears 10 times (441-450).\n     - 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n   - Total: 50 for 4, 48 for 8.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488, and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering how digits are structured in page numbers. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488, which is a three-digit number. So, I should analyze the occurrence of 4's and 8's in each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nI'll handle each digit place separately for both 4's and 8's.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - In the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in the units place.\n   - The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488.\n   - There are 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 complete groups, which gives 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place.\n   - However, since 488 ends with 8, the last group isn't complete, but since we're only looking for 4's, which would have appeared once in each group, it doesn't affect the count here.\n   - So, units place: 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In the tens place, the digits cycle every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in each hundred.\n   - So, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the tens place is determined by how many hundreds there are and how many extra tens.\n   - There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Then, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 0-8. The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 occurrences.\n   - So, total in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - In the hundreds place, the digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 since the book has 488 pages.\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - So, hundreds place: 89 times.\n\nWait, but actually, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all those numbers. So, yes, that's 89 occurrences.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nHmm, wait, let me double-check the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\nNow, I'll do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, each digit appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Number of complete groups of 10 in 488 is 48, so 48 occurrences of 8 in the units place.\n   - Plus, in the last partial group (481-488), 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more.\n   - So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the total number of units digits is 488. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, meaning there are 48 complete groups and a partial group of 8 numbers (481-488). Each complete group contributes one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the partial group, 488 has an 8, so that's one more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In the tens place, each digit appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Then, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, 9 occurrences.\n   - So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n   - So, hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nAdding up all the 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check the tens place again.\n\nIn the tens place, for each hundred, the digit 8 appears 10 times. So, 1-100: 80-89, that's 10 times. Similarly, 101-200: 180-189, 10 times. 201-300: 280-289, 10 times. 301-400: 380-389, 10 times. So, that's 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n\nThen, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), 488 has an 8, so that's one more, making it 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier when I calculated 4's, I got 187, and 8's are 98. So, the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 times.\n- Tens place: 50 times (40 from the first four hundreds, and 10 from 440-449).\n- Hundreds place: 89 times (400-488).\n\nSo, 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nAnd for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49.\n- Tens place: 49.\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it: from 1 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers (400-488 inclusive), so that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if 400-488 is 89 numbers. 488 - 400 + 1 = 89, yes.\n\nSo, 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the difference might be 90, but maybe it's 89. Let me double-check the counts again.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's in the tens place.\n\nFrom 1 to 488:\n\n- In the tens place, 4 appears in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n\nEach of these ranges is 10 numbers, so 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50. That's correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nUnits place: 4 appears once every 10 numbers, so 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full times, but since 488 is the last page, and 488 mod 10 is 8, which is not 4, so we don't get an extra 4 in the units place. So, 48 times.\n\nSo, 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more, making it 49.\n\nTens place: 40 from the four hundreds, and 9 from 480-488, totaling 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nThus, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I'm thinking, is there a way to confirm this? Maybe by using a different method.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about each digit place separately and calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nFor the units place:\n\n- The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is floor(N/10) + (1 if the last digit is >= d else 0).\n\nWait, but for digits 4 and 8, it's similar.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of 4's = floor(488/10) = 48. Since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is greater than 4, so we add 1? Wait, no, because we're counting how many times 4 appears in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times, and in the last partial cycle, 481-488, 484 is in there, which is one occurrence. So, total 48 + 1 = 49? Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, now I'm confused.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the formula is: number of times digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is floor(N/10) + (1 if (N % 10) >= d else 0).\n\nSo, for d=4:\n\nfloor(488/10) = 48.\n\n488 % 10 = 8, which is >=4, so add 1.\n\nSo, total 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 48. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let's test with a smaller number. Let's say N=14.\n\nFrom 1 to 14, units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,1,2,3,4.\n\nSo, digit 4 appears twice: at 4 and 14.\n\nUsing the formula: floor(14/10)=1, and 14%10=4 >=4, so 1+1=2. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for N=13:\n\nfloor(13/10)=1, 13%10=3 <4, so 1+0=1. Correct, since only 4 appears once.\n\nSo, applying this to N=488 for digit 4:\n\nfloor(488/10)=48, 488%10=8 >=4, so 48+1=49.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 48, but actually, it's 49. So, I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8 in the units place:\n\nfloor(488/10)=48, 488%10=8 >=8, so 48+1=49.\n\nSo, both 4 and 8 have 49 occurrences in the units place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's in units place were 48, but now it's 49. So, that changes things.\n\nWait, so let's recalculate.\n\n**Recounting 4's:**\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Recounting 8's:**\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, so I must have made a mistake earlier by not considering that in the units place, 4 appears 49 times, not 48.\n\nLet me go through it again carefully.\n\n**Units place for 4's:**\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, 4 appears once: 4,14,24,...,484.\n\nNow, how many such numbers are there?\n\nThe last occurrence is 484, which is the 48th occurrence (since 484 = 4 + 10*(n-1), so n=49? Wait, 484 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 4 as the first.\n\nWait, but 488 \u00f710 =48.8, so there are 48 full decades, each contributing one 4, and then in the 49th decade (481-490), 484 is within 481-488, so that's one more 4. So, total 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: 8,18,28,...,488. The last one is 488, so that's 49 occurrences.\n\nSo, units place for both 4 and 8: 49 each.\n\n**Tens place for 4's:**\n\nAs before, each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place: 40-49,140-149, etc.\n\nFrom 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40.\n\nThen, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers.\n\nSo, total 40 +10=50.\n\n**Hundreds place for 4's:**\n\nFrom 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\n**Tens place for 8's:**\n\nEach hundred contributes 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place: 80-89,180-189, etc.\n\nFrom 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40.\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive).\n\nSo, total 40 +9=49.\n\n**Hundreds place for 8's:**\n\nSince the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 89, but after correcting the units place for 4's, it's 90.\n\nWait, let me confirm with another approach.\n\nAnother way is to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place.\n\n**Units place:**\n\nFor 4's: floor(488/10)=48, and since 488%10 >=4, add 1, so 49.\n\nFor 8's: floor(488/10)=48, and since 488%10 >=8, add 1, so 49.\n\n**Tens place:**\n\nFor 4's: floor(488/100)=4, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles up to 8. The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 40+10=50.\n\nFor 8's: floor(488/100)=4, so 4\u00d710=40. In the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total 40+9=49.\n\n**Hundreds place:**\n\nFor 4's: floor(488/1000)=0, but since 488 >=400, we have 488 -400 +1=89 numbers where the hundreds digit is 4.\n\nFor 8's: There are no hundreds digits of 8 in 488, so 0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think I made a mistake earlier by not correctly applying the formula for the units place, which led me to an incorrect count of 48 for 4's. After correcting that, the difference is 90.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups of 10, contributing 48 occurrences. Since the last number (488) ends with 8, there's an extra 4 in 484, making it 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times every 100 numbers. From 1-400, there are 40 occurrences. In 401-488, 440-449 adds 10 more, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 times.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups, plus one more in 488, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 8 appears 10 times every 100 numbers, contributing 40 from 1-400. In 401-488, 480-488 adds 9 more, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should understand how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers will be from 1 to 9 (one-digit), 10 to 99 (two-digit), and 100 to 488 (three-digit). \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor the units digit, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, I can calculate the number of times 4 appears in the units place by dividing 488 by 10, which gives 48 full groups of 10, and then there are 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). In each full group, 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. In the last partial group, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times for the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place: same approach. 488 divided by 10 is 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. The last partial group has 8 in the units place when the number is 488, so that's one more. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times for 8 in the units place.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place. So, the difference here is zero. Hmm, but maybe I made a mistake because 488 is the last page, so let me check.\n\nWait, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (1-480) and then 481-488. So, in 1-480, 48 times 10, so 48 times each digit appears in the units place. Then, in 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, yes, 49 each. So, units place contributes 49 fours and 49 eights.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nFor the tens digit, it cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for 488 pages, how many hundreds do we have? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488). Wait, actually, 488 is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488, which is 88 numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate how many times each digit appears in the tens place across all page numbers.\n\nFor the tens digit:\n\n- From 1 to 100: The tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each (e.g., 00-09, 10-19, etc.). But since we're starting from 1, the first group is 1-9, which have no tens digit, so maybe it's better to think in terms of 1-100.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to break it down as:\n\n- For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, from 1 to 400, there are 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for 400 pages, 4 hundreds, each digit appears 4*10 = 40 times in the tens place.\n\nBut wait, 400 is page 400, so the next pages are 401-488, which is 88 pages. So, let's handle 401-488 separately.\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 481-488). So, the tens digits in 401-488 are 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), and 8 (481-488). \n\nNow, for each of these tens digits, how many times does each digit appear?\n\n- 0 appears 10 times (401-410)\n- 1 appears 10 times (411-420)\n- 2 appears 10 times (421-430)\n- 3 appears 10 times (431-440)\n- 4 appears 10 times (441-450)\n- 5 appears 10 times (451-460)\n- 6 appears 10 times (461-470)\n- 7 appears 10 times (471-480)\n- 8 appears 8 times (481-488)\n\nWait, because 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8, appearing 8 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place from 401-488, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nNow, adding this to the previous 400 pages:\n\nFrom 1-400, in the tens place, 4 appears 4*10 = 40 times, and 8 appears 4*10 = 40 times.\n\nFrom 401-488, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, total in the tens place:\n\n4's: 40 + 10 = 50 times.\n\n8's: 40 + 8 = 48 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 48 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nThe hundreds digit is only present from page 100 onwards. Let's see:\n\n- Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's here.\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's.\n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, no 4's or 8's.\n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, no 4's or 8's.\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so 4 appears here. How many times?\n\nFrom 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the next hundred after 400 is 500, which is beyond 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place in this book. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from the total 4's: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- 488 pages. For each 10 pages, 4 appears once in units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full times, and then the last 8 pages (481-488) have one more 4 at 484. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Same for 8's, at 488, so 49.\n\nTens place:\n\n- From 1-400: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times for 4 and 8 in the tens place, so 4*10 = 40 each.\n- From 401-488: tens digit goes from 0 to 8. For 4, it's 10 times (441-450). For 8, it's 8 times (481-488).\n- So, 4's: 40 + 10 = 50, 8's: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 400-488: 89 pages, so 89 times 4 appears. 8 doesn't appear in hundreds place.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 91.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Hmm, let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I think I should consider each digit place separately\u2014like the units place and the tens place. Because when counting digits, sometimes the same digit appears in different places, so I need to account for all of them.\n\nLet me start by thinking about the units place. For every group of 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place, right? Same with the digit 8. So, for example, in pages 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, 4 appears once, and 8 appears once.\n\nNow, how many such groups of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, there are 48 full groups of 10 and then 8 extra pages (since 48*10=480, and 488-480=8). So, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times, except for the last partial group. But in the last 8 pages, the units digits are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7. So, in the units place, 4 appears once more, and 8 doesn't appear again because the last digit is 7. Wait, no, actually, in the units place for the last 8 pages, 4 appears once (page 484) and 8 doesn't appear because 488 is the last page, but 488's units digit is 8, right? Wait, no, 488 is the last page, so the units digit is 8. So, in the units place, 8 appears once in the last group as well. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust that.\n\nWait, let's clarify. Each full group of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 full groups would contribute 48 fours and 48 eights. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488) have units digits from 1 to 8. So, in these, 4 appears once (page 484) and 8 appears once (page 488). So, total units place: 48 +1=49 fours and 48 +1=49 eights. So, in the units place, 4 and 8 are equal, each appearing 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit changes every 10 pages. For example, from 1-10, the tens digit is 0 or 1? Wait, no, actually, from 1-9, the tens digit is 0, and from 10-19, the tens digit is 1, and so on. So, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for 488 pages, let's see how many times each digit appears in the tens place.\n\nFirst, let's consider hundreds, tens, and units places. Wait, 488 is a three-digit number, so we have hundreds, tens, and units. But when considering the tens place, we can think in terms of how many times each digit appears in the tens place across all page numbers.\n\nEach complete hundred (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has each digit from 0-9 appearing exactly 10 times in the tens place. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), then 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), ..., up to 9 (90-99). So, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred.\n\nNow, since the book has 488 pages, let's see how many complete hundreds there are. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each of these 4 complete hundreds, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and the digit 8 appears 10 times as well (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for each hundred, 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 fours and 4*10=40 eights.\n\nNow, let's look at the incomplete hundred: 401-488. Here, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, we need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place from 401 to 488.\n\nFirst, the tens digit in 401-410 is 0, so no 4 or 8 there. Then, 411-420: tens digit is 1. Similarly, 421-430: tens digit 2, 431-440: tens digit 3, 441-450: tens digit 4. So, in 441-450, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 pages, so 10 fours. Then, 451-460: tens digit 5, 461-470: tens digit 6, 471-480: tens digit 7, and 481-488: tens digit 8. So, in 481-488, the tens digit is 8 for 8 pages (481-488 is 8 pages: 481,482,...,488). So, that's 8 eights in the tens place.\n\nSo, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 441-450, which is 10 times, and 8 in 481-488, which is 8 times.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place, the total number of 4's is 40 (from the complete hundreds) +10=50, and the total number of 8's is 40 (from the complete hundreds) +8=48.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. From 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 fours. And the tens digit is 8 in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 eights. So, yes, that adds up.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's:50, 8's:48.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is only 1,2,3,4.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's:89, 8's:0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:48\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49+48=97\n\nWait, that can't be right because 49+48=97, and 188-97=91, which would mean there are 91 more 4's than 8's. But let me double-check the calculations because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 49 fours and 49 eights. Then, in the tens place, 50 fours and 48 eights. So, total fours:49+50+89=188, and eights:49+48=97. So, 188-97=91. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, another way to check: total number of digits printed. Each page from 1 to 488 has either 1, 2, or 3 digits. Pages 1-9: 1 digit each, so 9 digits. Pages 10-99: 2 digits each, so 90 pages *2=180 digits. Pages 100-488: 3 digits each, so 389 pages (since 488-100+1=389) *3=1167 digits. So total digits:9+180+1167=1356 digits.\n\nNow, the total number of digits should also be equal to the sum of all digits printed. So, if I count the number of 4's and 8's, they should be part of this total.\n\nBut maybe that's overcomplicating. Let me just go back and check each step.\n\nUnits place: Each group of 10 has one 4 and one 8. 488/10=48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1 four and 1 eight, so 48 each. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place:48+1=49 fours, 48+1=49 eights. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. 4 hundreds (1-400) give 4*10=40 fours and 40 eights. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 441-450 (10 fours) and 8 in 481-488 (8 eights). So, total tens place:40+10=50 fours, 40+8=48 eights. That adds up.\n\nHundreds place: Only pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, which is 89 pages, so 89 fours. No 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total fours:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal eights:49 (units) +48 (tens)=97.\n\nSo, 188-97=91. So, there are 91 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place in the incomplete hundred. From 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear?\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-488). Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which appears 8 times.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think. Each tens digit from 0 to 8 in the 400s would appear 10 times except for the last one, which might be cut short.\n\nWait, from 400-409: tens digit 0 (10 pages)\n410-419: tens digit 1 (10 pages)\n...\n470-479: tens digit 7 (10 pages)\n480-488: tens digit 8 (9 pages? Wait, 480-488 is 9 pages: 480,481,...,488. Wait, 488-480=8, so 9 pages including both ends.\n\nWait, so in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages, but 480 is included in 401-488, so that's correct. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in 480-488. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 8 times because 481-488 is 8 pages, but actually, 480 is also included, making it 9 pages. So, I think I made a mistake there.\n\nWait, let me recount. From 401-488, the tens digits:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 pages)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10 pages)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10 pages)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10 pages)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 pages)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10 pages)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10 pages)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10 pages)\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 pages, since 488-481+1=8)\n\nWait, but 480 is included in the 471-480 group, so 471-480 is 10 pages, right? So, 471,472,...,480. So, 480 is the 10th page in that group. Then, 481-488 is the next group, which is 8 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 8 times in the incomplete hundred.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 480-488 is 9 pages, but 480 is part of the 471-480 group, so 480 is included in that 10-page group. So, 481-488 is only 8 pages, so the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place in the incomplete hundred.\n\nSo, in the tens place, from 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). Therefore, total tens place:40+10=50 fours, 40+8=48 eights.\n\nSo, my initial calculation was correct. Therefore, total fours:188, eights:97, difference:91.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. 488-400+1=89 pages, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n\n8's:49 (units) +48 (tens)=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought 480-488 would have 9 pages, but now I'm seeing it's 8 pages. Let me confirm:\n\nFrom 481 to 488 inclusive, that's 488-481+1=8 pages. So, 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488: 8 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place, not 9. So, my initial calculation was correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 91 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Units Place Analysis:**\n   - Each group of 10 consecutive pages (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) contains exactly one '4' and one '8' in the units place.\n   - There are 48 full groups of 10 pages in 488 pages (488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8).\n   - Each group contributes 1 '4' and 1 '8', totaling 48 '4's and 48 '8's.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1 through 8, adding one more '4' (at 484) and one more '8' (at 488).\n   - **Total in units place:** 49 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place Analysis:**\n   - Each hundred (e.g., 1-100) has each digit (0-9) appearing 10 times in the tens place.\n   - There are 4 complete hundreds (1-400), contributing 10 '4's and 10 '8's each, totaling 40 '4's and 40 '8's.\n   - From 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. \n     - '4' appears in the tens place for pages 441-450 (10 times).\n     - '8' appears in the tens place for pages 481-488 (8 times).\n   - **Total in tens place:** 50 '4's and 48 '8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place Analysis:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have '4' in the hundreds place, totaling 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1).\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 89 '4's and 0 '8's.\n\n4. **Summing Up:**\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) = 97.\n   - **Difference:** 188 - 97 = 91.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe digit '4' is printed 91 more times than the digit '8'.  \n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that each page number from 1 to 488 is printed once. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by thinking about how digits are structured in page numbers. Page numbers can be one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit numbers. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to three digits, specifically from 1 to 488.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to consider each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each position and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place (e.g., 4, 14, 24, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears once (e.g., 8, 18, 28, etc.).\n\nSo, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Let me divide 488 by 10, which gives 48.8. Since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra pages (481-488).\n\nIn each complete set of 10, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 sets, that's 48 times 4's and 48 times 8's in the units place.\n\nNow, for the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial set, the digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). Therefore, the units place contributes 48 + 1 = 49 times for 4's and 48 + 1 = 49 times for 8's.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, in the units place, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 and 8 appear?\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position across all page numbers.\n\nLet me structure it as follows:\n\n1. Units place:\n   - For each 10 numbers, 4 appears once, 8 appears once.\n   - Total number of 10s in 488 is 48 full tens, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n   - So, in full tens: 48 * 1 = 48 times for 4, and 48 times for 8.\n   - In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n   - So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 times for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 times for 8.\n\n2. Tens place:\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For each 100 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n   - So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, it appears 10 times in each 100 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n   - Similarly, for 8 in the tens place, it appears 10 times in each 100 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n   - Now, how many full hundreds are there in 488 pages? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488).\n   - So, for each full hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times.\n   - Therefore, in 4 full hundreds, 4 appears 4 * 10 = 40 times, and 8 appears 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n   - Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), let's look at the tens place:\n     - Pages 401-409: tens digit is 0, so no 4 or 8.\n     - Pages 410-419: tens digit is 1, so no 4 or 8.\n     - Pages 420-429: tens digit is 2, so no 4 or 8.\n     - Pages 430-439: tens digit is 3, so no 4 or 8.\n     - Pages 440-449: tens digit is 4, so 4 appears 10 times (440-449).\n     - Pages 450-459: tens digit is 5, so no 4 or 8.\n     - Pages 460-469: tens digit is 6, so no 4 or 8.\n     - Pages 470-479: tens digit is 7, so no 4 or 8.\n     - Pages 480-488: tens digit is 8, so 8 appears 9 times (since 480-488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them).\n   - Wait, but pages 480-488 are 9 pages (480,481,...,488), so the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in this partial set.\n   - So, in the tens place for the remaining 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Therefore, total tens place:\n     - 4: 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 = 50 times.\n     - 8: 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\n   - The hundreds digit is only relevant for numbers 100 and above.\n   - For numbers 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so we can ignore it.\n   - Now, in the hundreds place, the digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 (since the book has 488 pages).\n   - So, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place.\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. That's 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 would be for pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit:\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's), which equals 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- Each 10 numbers, 4 and 8 each appear once in units place.\n- 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1 to 4 and 1 to 8.\n- Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n- So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each full hundred (100 numbers) contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place.\n- There are 4 full hundreds (1-400), so 4 * 10 = 40 for each digit.\n- Now, the remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n  - From 401-409: tens digit is 0, so no 4 or 8.\n  - 410-419: tens digit 1, no.\n  - 420-429: tens digit 2, no.\n  - 430-439: tens digit 3, no.\n  - 440-449: tens digit 4, 10 times.\n  - 450-459: tens digit 5, no.\n  - 460-469: tens digit 6, no.\n  - 470-479: tens digit 7, no.\n  - 480-488: tens digit 8, 9 times (since 480-488 is 9 pages).\n- So, tens place: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 9 times.\n- Total for tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, 40 + 9 = 49 for 8. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears in hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up:\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, but I just realized something. When counting the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so 89 times.\n\nBut wait, in the tens place, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), I considered 480-488 as 9 pages, but actually, from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 pages, so 9 times the digit 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, 480 is the start, and 488 is the end. So, 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, that's correct.\n\nLet me check the units place again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 48 full tens (48 times) plus one more in the last partial set (484), so 49 times. Same for 8: 48 times in full tens plus one in 488, so 49 times. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: 4 appears 10 times in 440-449, which is correct, and 8 appears 9 times in 480-488. So, 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8.\n\nHundreds place: 89 times for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be 90, but let me check if I counted correctly.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position separately.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a more systematic approach.\n\nFor the units digit:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is given by:\n\nunits = (N // 10) * 1 + min(max(N % 10 - d + 1, 0), 1)\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to compute as follows:\n\nFor units digit:\n- For each digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place up to N is (N // 10) + (1 if N % 10 >= d else 0).\n\nSo, for d=4:\nunits_4 = (488 // 10) + (1 if 488 % 10 >= 4 else 0) = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8:\nunits_8 = (488 // 10) + (1 if 488 % 10 >= 8 else 0) = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSo, units place: 49 each.\n\nFor the tens digit:\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the tens place up to N can be calculated as:\n\ntens = (N // 100) * 10 + extra, where extra depends on the tens digit.\n\nIf the tens digit part is greater than d, add 10. If it's equal to d, add (N % 10 + 1). Otherwise, add 0.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to break it down.\n\nFor the tens place, the digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each full hundred contributes 10 times for each digit.\n\nSo, for N = 488, the number of full hundreds is 4 (since 4*100=400), and the remaining is 88.\n\nFor d=4 in tens place:\n\nNumber of full hundreds: 4, each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit can be 0-8.\n\nWe need to see how many times 4 appears in the tens place in 401-488.\n\nLooking at 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-409) to 8 (480-488).\n\nSo, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 times.\n\nTherefore, total tens_4 = 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8 in tens place:\n\nNumber of full hundreds: 4, each contributing 10 times, so 40.\n\nIn the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 times.\n\nThus, tens_8 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\nFor d=4:\n\nThe hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\nFor d=8:\n\nThe hundreds digit is 8 would start at 800, but since our N is 488, there are no numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, hundreds_8 = 0.\n\nNow, summing up:\n\nTotal_4 = units_4 + tens_4 + hundreds_4 = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal_8 = units_8 + tens_8 + hundreds_8 = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, I think 90 is the correct answer. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in different positions, it's easy to make off-by-one errors or miscount.\n\nLet me verify the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those 89 pages, so 89 times. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for the remaining 88 pages after 400, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, that's correct.\n\nUnits place: each digit from 0-9 appears equally in the units place, except possibly the last partial set. Since 488 ends with 8, the units digits go up to 8, so 4 appears once more in the units place (484), and 8 appears once (488). So, units_4 and units_8 are both 49.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately:\n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full sets, contributing 48 times each for 4 and 8.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488) contribute 1 more for both 4 and 8.\n   - **Total**: 49 each.\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - 4 full hundreds contribute 40 times each for 4 and 8.\n   - Remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n     - 4 appears 10 times (440-449).\n     - 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - **Total**: 50 for 4, 49 for 8.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total**: 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nSumming these:\n- **4's**: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's**: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = **90**\n\nThe digit 4 appears 90 more times than the digit 8 in the page numbers.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that each page number is printed once, from 1 to 488. So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nI think the best way to do this is to break down the problem by looking at each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds, and maybe even thousands, although 488 doesn't go into thousands. Let me start by considering each place one by one.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the digit 4 will appear once every 10 numbers, and the same goes for the digit 8.\n\nNow, let's calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place. The total number of pages is 488, so the number of complete blocks of 10 is 48 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8). In each of these 48 blocks, 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, there's a remainder of 8 pages after 48 blocks (since 48*10=480, and 488-480=8). So, in the last partial block from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 4 appear in the units place here? Yes, at page 484. So that's one more occurrence. So, total 4's in units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, in each block of 10, 8 appears once. So, again, 48 complete blocks give 48 occurrences. Then, in the last partial block, the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears at 488. So, that's one more, making it 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that's the same as 4's in the units place. Hmm, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nWait, that seems odd. Let me double-check. For units place, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, 4 and 8 each appear once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles and 8 extra numbers. So, 48 times each, plus in the extra 8 numbers, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, yes, 49 each. So, the units place contributes equally to both digits.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit is 0 for 0-9, 1 for 10-19, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place per 100 numbers.\n\nSo, for the digit 4 in the tens place, in each 100 numbers, it appears 10 times. Similarly, for 8, it also appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers.\n\nNow, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each of the 4 complete hundreds, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 = 40 times. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times in each hundred, so 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, let's look at the remaining 88 pages (401-488). The tens digit here ranges from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in the range 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, that's 10 more times for 4. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the range 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 pages (480-488). Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 from 480-489, but we only have up to 488, so the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but wait, 480 is the first page in this range, so 480, 481, ..., 488, which is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the last partial hundred.\n\nWait, but let me clarify: the tens digit is determined by the second digit from the right. So, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, it occurs when the tens digit is 4, which is from 440 to 449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times. For the digit 8 in the tens place, it occurs from 480 to 489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480-488. So, 9 times.\n\nWait, but 480 is the first page in the 480-488 range, so that's 9 pages, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, yes, 9 times.\n\nSo, for the tens place, the digit 4 appears 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from the partial hundred) = 50 times. The digit 8 appears 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 (from the partial hundred) = 49 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times. So, the difference here is 50 - 49 = 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, in each complete hundred, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times in the tens place, so 4*10=40 for each. Then, in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. For 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. So, yes, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8. So, the tens place gives 1 more 4 than 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is the third digit from the right. In a 3-digit number, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, since the book has 488 pages.\n\nFor the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 3-digit number, the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 only, and 8 doesn't appear at all in the hundreds place. So, 0 times for 8.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, that's a difference of 89 more 4's than 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is indeed 89 numbers. So, yes, 89 times for 4, and 0 for 8.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n- 4's: 49\n- 8's: 49\n\nTens place:\n- 4's: 50\n- 8's: 49\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nNow, let's add them up.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98.\n\nThe difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, I had 89 4's, which seems correct because from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. But let me double-check the other places.\n\nUnits place: 488 pages. For units digit, 488 / 10 = 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So, 48 +1 =49 each. Correct.\n\nTens place: Each complete hundred (1-100, etc.) contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens digit. There are 4 complete hundreds, so 4*10=40 each. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 from 440-449 (10 numbers) and 8 from 480-488 (9 numbers). So, 40 +10=50 for 4, and 40 +9=49 for 8. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 +50 +89 = 188.\n\n8's:49 +49 +0=98.\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nHmm, so 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Wait, 488 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the total number of digits. Each page number from 1 to 488. Pages 1-9 are single-digit, so 9 pages. Pages 10-99 are two-digit, 90 pages. Pages 100-488 are three-digit, 389 pages.\n\nSo, total digits:\n\nSingle-digit: 9 pages, 1 digit each: 9 digits.\n\nTwo-digit:90 pages, 2 digits each:180 digits.\n\nThree-digit:389 pages, 3 digits each:1167 digits.\n\nTotal digits:9 +180 +1167=1356 digits.\n\nWait, but the total number of digits can also be calculated by counting how many times each digit appears in each place.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if my total count of 4's and 8's adds up correctly.\n\nTotal 4's:188.\n\nTotal 8's:98.\n\nSo, 188 +98=286 digits accounted for, but the total digits are 1356, so that's just a small part. So, perhaps the counts are correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Wait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those, so 89 times. That seems correct.\n\nWait, let me check another way. How many times does 4 appear in each place:\n\nUnits place:49.\n\nTens place:50.\n\nHundreds place:89.\n\nTotal:49+50+89=188.\n\nSimilarly, 8's:\n\nUnits place:49.\n\nTens place:49.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTotal:98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nHmm, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let me try a different approach. Maybe using a formula or a different counting method.\n\nAnother way to count digit occurrences is to consider each digit position separately and calculate how many times each digit appears.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in units place up to N is given by:\n\nfloor((N + 1) / 10) * 1 + min(max(d - (N % 10) + 1, 0), 10).\n\nWait, maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, for each digit position, we can calculate how many times each digit appears.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to stick with my initial method, as it's more straightforward.\n\nWait, another way: Let's consider each digit place separately.\n\nUnits place:\n\nTotal numbers:488.\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears floor(488/10)=48 times in each cycle of 10. Then, the remainder is 8.\n\nFor digit 4: In the units place, it appears 48 times in the complete cycles. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once. So, total 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, digit 8: 48 times in complete cycles, and in the remaining 8 numbers, 8 appears once (at 488). So, 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears 10 times in each block of 100. So, for 488 pages, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 times for each digit in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 for each digit.\n\nThen, the remaining 88 pages (401-488). The tens digit cycles from 0-8.\n\nFor digit 4 in the tens place: It appears in the range 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nFor digit 8 in the tens place: It appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo, total for 4:40 +10=50.\n\nTotal for 8:40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears in the hundreds place for blocks of 1000, but since our number is 488, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nFor digit 4: It appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nFor digit 8: It doesn't appear in the hundreds place because 800-899 would be beyond 488. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's:50 (tens) +49 (units) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, I think that's correct. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book is 188, while the digit 8 appears 98 times. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should consider how page numbers are structured. Page numbers go from 1 to 488, so each page has a number that can be one, two, three, or four digits long. The digits in these numbers will include 4's and 8's, and I need to count how many times each digit appears in the units place, tens place, hundreds place, and so on.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds, and thousands. Since the book has 488 pages, the thousands place will only be relevant if the page number is 1000 or more, but since 488 is less than 1000, the thousands place won't have any digits. So I can ignore the thousands place.\n\nNow, I'll handle each digit place one by one, starting with the units place.\n\n**Units Place:**\nFor the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. From 11 to 20, it's 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0 again, and so on.\n\nI need to find how many times 4 appears in the units place and how many times 8 appears.\n\nSince the page numbers go up to 488, I can calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and an additional 8 numbers (481 to 488). \n\nIn each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 4,14,24,...), and so does the digit 8 (like 8,18,28,...). So for 48 complete groups, the number of 4's in the units place is 48, and the same for 8's.\n\nNow, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So here, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So the total for the units place is 48 + 1 = 49 for 4's and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8's. Wait, that seems equal, but let me double-check. From 1 to 480, it's 48 groups, so 48 times each. Then from 481 to 488, units digits go from 1 to 8. So 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So yes, both have 49 in the units place.\n\n**Tens Place:**\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place within each hundred. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. Then this repeats for each subsequent hundred.\n\nI need to find how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times 8 appears.\n\nFirst, let's determine how many complete hundreds are in 488. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and an additional 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and the same for 8 (80-89). So for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times for 4's and 4 * 10 = 40 times for 8's.\n\nNow, looking at the remaining 88 pages (401-488). The tens digit in this range cycles from 0 to 8. Let's break it down:\n\n- From 401-410: tens digit is 0 (401-410)\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nWait, actually, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So in this range, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's in 441-450, which is 10 times (441,442,...,450). Similarly, 8 appears in 481-488, but that's only 8 numbers (481-488), so the tens digit is 8 for 8 times.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The tens digit is the second digit from the right. So in 481-488, the tens digit is 8 for all those numbers. So from 481 to 488, that's 8 numbers, so 8 times the tens digit is 8.\n\nBut wait, 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for each of those 8 numbers. So in the tens place, 8 appears 8 times in this partial hundred.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, it's from 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nSo total in the tens place:\n\n- 4's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50\n- 8's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me check again.\n\nFrom 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40 each.\n\nThen, from 401-488, the tens digit for 4's is in 441-450, which is 10 times, and for 8's, it's in 481-488, which is 8 times.\n\nSo total:\n\n- 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 8's in tens place: 40 + 8 = 48\n\nWait, but 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for each, so that's 8 times. So yes, 8 more times for 8's.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, 400-488 would have hundreds digit 4, right?\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\n- Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (since they're two-digit numbers), but actually, in page numbers, 1-99 are just single or two-digit numbers without a hundreds digit. Wait, but when considering digit places, the hundreds digit is 0 for numbers less than 100, but in reality, page numbers don't have leading zeros, so the hundreds digit is only present when the page number is 100 or more.\n\nSo, for the hundreds place:\n\n- Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (but since we're only considering actual printed digits, these pages don't have a hundreds digit, so we can ignore them for the hundreds place count).\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1\n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2\n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total:\n\n- 4's in hundreds place: 89\n- 8's in hundreds place: 0\n\nWait, but let me confirm: from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\n**Thousands Place:**\nAs mentioned earlier, since the book only has 488 pages, the thousands place is never used, so no digits here.\n\n**Now, let's sum up all the occurrences:**\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nWait, wait a second, earlier in the tens place, I had 4's as 50 and 8's as 48. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, in the units place, both 4 and 8 had 49 each.\n\nIn the tens place, 4's were 50 and 8's were 48.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4's were 89 and 8's were 0.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nSo the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n**Units Place Recheck:**\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many 4's and 8's in the units place.\n\nEach group of 10 has one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: floor(488 / 10) = 48 groups.\n\nSo 48 times each.\n\nThen, the remaining 8 numbers: 481-488.\n\nUnits digits: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nSo 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n\nSo total units place:\n\n4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\nThat's correct.\n\n**Tens Place Recheck:**\n\nEach hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place.\n\nNumber of complete hundreds: 4 (1-400). So 4*10=40 each.\n\nThen, from 401-488:\n\nLooking at the tens digit:\n\n401-410: tens digit 0\n\n411-420: 1\n\n421-430: 2\n\n431-440: 3\n\n441-450: 4 (10 numbers)\n\n451-460:5\n\n461-470:6\n\n471-480:7\n\n481-488:8 (8 numbers)\n\nSo in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n\nSo total in tens place:\n\n4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n\n8's: 40 + 8 = 48\n\nThat's correct.\n\n**Hundreds Place Recheck:**\n\nFrom 400-488, hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n\nSo 89 times for 4's.\n\n8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nThat's correct.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, from 400-488, how many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these 89 pages. So that's 89 times.\n\nIs there any other place where 4 appears in the hundreds digit? No, because the book ends at 488, so 500 isn't reached.\n\nSimilarly, 8 in the hundreds place doesn't occur because the book doesn't have 800 pages.\n\nSo yes, 89 times for 4's in the hundreds place, 0 for 8's.\n\nSo the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 97, so the difference is 91.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to miscount. Let me try a different approach to verify.\n\nAlternative Approach:\n\nInstead of counting each digit place separately, maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each position and sum them up.\n\nBut I think the initial approach was correct. Let me just verify the counts again.\n\nUnits Place:\n\n488 / 10 = 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 and one 8.\n\nRemaining 8 numbers: 481-488. Units digits: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So 4 appears once, 8 appears once.\n\nTotal units: 48 +1=49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nTens Place:\n\nEach hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4 and 10 where it's 8.\n\n4 hundreds: 4*10=40 each.\n\nThen, in the last partial hundred (401-488), tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (441-450) and 8 for 8 numbers (481-488).\n\nSo 4's: 40 +10=50\n\n8's: 40 +8=48\n\nHundreds Place:\n\n4's: 89\n\n8's: 0\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 +50 +89=188\n\n8's:49 +48 +0=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something else. When counting the hundreds place, are we including all the 4's from 400-488? Let me confirm:\n\nFrom 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 pages. Each of these has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the final answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each group of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n- 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 full groups, contributing 48 each.\n- Remaining 8 numbers (481-488) add one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n- Total: 49 each.\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8.\n- 4 hundreds contribute 40 each.\n- Remaining 88 numbers (401-488) add 10 occurrences of 4 (441-450) and 8 occurrences of 8 (481-488).\n- Total: 50 for 4's, 48 for 8's.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- 400-488 contributes 89 occurrences of 4.\n- No occurrences of 8.\n- Total: 89 for 4's, 0 for 8's.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488. Then, I'll do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering how digits are structured. Page numbers can be one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit numbers. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488, which is a three-digit number.\n\nI think it's best to separate the counting based on the number of digits: units, tens, and hundreds place. I'll handle each place separately for both 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:** The 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\n   The total number of tens in 488 is 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8). But wait, that's not exactly right. Let me think again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 480, there are 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. Then from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so no additional 4's there. So that's 48 times.\n\n   Wait, but wait, from 1 to 488, the units digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So the number of times would be the number of complete tens, which is 48, plus any additional in the incomplete set. But 488 is 48*10 + 8, so the incomplete set is 8 numbers, which doesn't include a 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, how about the tens digit being 4? This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n\n   Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So from 1 to 488, how many such blocks are there?\n\n   Let's see, the first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10, and so on. The last block would be 440-449, which is another 10. Now, after that, we go up to 488, so 450-488. The tens digit in 450-488 is 5,6,7,8, so no more 4's in the tens place beyond 440-449.\n\n   So how many blocks of 100 are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488.\n\n   Wait, 400-488 is part of the 400s, so the tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So 5*10 = 50 times.\n\n   Wait, but wait, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total tens place 4's: 5*10=50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how about the hundreds digit being 4? That happens from page 400 to 488. So how many numbers is that?\n\n   From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers, meaning 89 times.\n\n   Wait, but wait, when counting digits, each of these numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So yes, 89 times.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So 187 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the units digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n\n   From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's the same as 4's units place, right? Because every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. So 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. Then from 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so in 488, the units digit is 8. So that's one more. So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit being 8. This occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n\n   Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So how many such blocks are there up to 488?\n\n   Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So the tens digit is 8 for all these 9 numbers, but the full block would be 10 numbers, so we have 9 instead of 10.\n\n   So the number of blocks where tens digit is 8: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 4 full blocks and one partial block.\n\n   So total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how about the hundreds digit being 8? That would be pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n   So hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 48 times. Because from 1-480, 48 sets of 10, each with a 4 in units place. Then 481-488 doesn't add any, so 48.\n\n- Tens: 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. Wait, earlier I thought 5 blocks, but let me check:\n\n   - 40-49: yes, that's 10 numbers.\n   - 140-149: another 10.\n   - 240-249: another 10.\n   - 340-349: another 10.\n   - 440-449: another 10.\n   So that's 5 blocks, each with 10 4's, so 5*10=50.\n\n- Hundreds: 400-488: 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 48+50+89=187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: From 1-488, every 10 numbers has an 8 in units place, so 48 times, plus in 488, the units digit is 8, so that's one more, making it 49.\n\n- Tens: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So 4*10 +9=49.\n\n- Hundreds: 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo the difference is 187-98=89.\n\nWait, but let me check the units digit for 8 again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nIt's every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. So the number of such numbers is floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 is exactly 48*10 +8, so the last one is 488, which is included. So that's 49 times. So yes, units place 8's:49.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place, 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers, so total 49.\n\nSo yes, 98 total 8's.\n\nTherefore, 187-98=89.\n\nI think that's correct. So the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 times (every 10 numbers up to 480, no additional 4 in 481-488).\n- **Tens place:** 50 times (10 numbers in each of 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 times (pages 400-488).\n- **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 times (48 full sets of 10 plus 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 times (10 numbers in each of 4 blocks plus 9 in 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 times.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"
