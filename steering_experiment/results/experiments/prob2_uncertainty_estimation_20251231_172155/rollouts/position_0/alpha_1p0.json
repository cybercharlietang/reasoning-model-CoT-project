    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488. Then, I'll do the same for the digit 8 and see the difference. Hmm, maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That might make it easier.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every set of ten numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets of ten and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each full set, 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 numbers, 481-488, does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see: 484 is the only one where 4 is in the units place. So that's one more. So total 4's in units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but actually, 488 is the last page, so when I divide 488 by 10, it's 48.8, so 48 full sets and 8 extra. So the 48 full sets contribute 48 times, and the extra 8 numbers (481-488) would have 484, which is 4 in the units place. So yes, 49 times for 4's in units place.\n\nNow, for the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically from 40-49, 140-149, etc. So how many times does this happen? From 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's five sets of 10 numbers each. Each set contributes 10 times the digit 4 in the tens place. So 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n\nBut wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, that's correct. So 50 times for 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. So how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but actually, in the hundreds place, each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 numbers, so 89 times. So total 4's in the hundreds place: 89.\n\nSo total 4's would be units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with units place. Similar to 4, in each set of ten numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So from 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of ten, each contributing 1, so 48 times. Then, the extra 8 numbers (481-488) include 488, which is 8 in the units place. So that's one more. So total 48 + 1 = 49 times for 8's in units place.\n\nNow, tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so the last range is 480-488. So how many full sets do we have? Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo that's 4 full sets of 10 and one set of 9. Each full set contributes 10 times the digit 8 in the tens place, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. The last set, 480-488, has 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place, so 9 times. So total 40 + 9 = 49 times for 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, each with 8 in tens place. Similarly, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 are each 10 numbers. Then 480-488 is 9 numbers. So 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. So yes, 49 times.\n\nNow, hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book is only up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So 0 times for 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total 8's would be units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. So total 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90. So 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts, especially for the 4's and 8's in the tens and units places.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full sets (1-480) gives 48, plus 484 in 481-488, so 49.\n- Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5\u00d710=50.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full sets (1-480) gives 48, plus 488 in 481-488, so 49.\n- Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. That's 5 sets, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 4\u00d710 + 9=49.\n- Hundreds place: 0.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo 188 - 98 = 90. So 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just check if I counted correctly for the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Yes, because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times, which adds up correctly.\n\nI think that's the right approach. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Each set of 10 numbers (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) has one 4 in the units place.\n   - There are 48 full sets of 10 in 480 pages, contributing 48 \u00d7 1 = 48.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) include 484, adding 1 more.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - There are five such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 occurrences.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4, 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - 48 full sets contribute 48, plus 488 adds 1 more.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - There are four full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - The range 480-488 contributes 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should consider how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears, then find the difference between the two counts.\n\nMaybe I should separate the counting based on the number of digits. Let's start with one-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digits 4 and 8 each appear once. So, both counts are 1 here. That means the difference so far is 0.\n\nNext, let's move on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. I think I should count the number of times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place and the ones place separately.\n\nFor the tens place in two-digit numbers:\n- The digit 4 appears in the tens place for the numbers 40 to 49. That's 10 times.\n- The digit 8 appears in the tens place for the numbers 80 to 89. That's also 10 times.\nSo, in the tens place, both digits appear 10 times each.\n\nFor the ones place in two-digit numbers:\n- The digit 4 appears once in every ten numbers, like 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 times.\n- Similarly, the digit 8 appears once in every ten numbers, like 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's also 9 times.\nWait, but wait, from 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers, so 9 sets of ten. So, each digit appears 9 times in the ones place.\n\nSo, adding up for two-digit numbers:\n- 4's: 10 (tens) + 9 (ones) = 19\n- 8's: 10 (tens) + 9 (ones) = 19\nSo, again, the difference is 0 so far.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is where it might get more complicated. I think I should break this down into hundreds, tens, and ones places.\n\nLet's start with the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n- The digit 4 appears only in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n- The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the highest hundreds digit is 4. So, 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nNow, for the tens place in three-digit numbers:\n- Let's consider each hundred separately: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488.\n\nFor each hundred group, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 every ten numbers.\n\nIn each hundred group, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Well, for each group, it's the numbers where the tens digit is 4, like 140-149, 240-249, etc. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so 10 times per hundred. But wait, in the last group (400-488), the tens digit can only go up to 8 because 488 is the last page. So, in 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 appears once in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 times.\n\nSo, for 4's in the tens place:\n- 100-199: 10\n- 200-299: 10\n- 300-399: 10\n- 400-488: 10\nTotal: 10*4 = 40 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place:\n- In each hundred group, the tens digit 8 appears in 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the last group. So, in 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each has 10 numbers where tens digit is 8. But in 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times there, not 10.\n\nWait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, for 8's in the tens place:\n- 100-199: 10\n- 200-299: 10\n- 300-399: 10\n- 400-488: 9\nTotal: 10+10+10+9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me check again. For 100-199, the tens digit 8 is in 180-189, which is 10 numbers. Similarly for 200-299, 280-289, which is 10. Same for 300-399, 380-389, which is 10. Now, for 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that's 9. So, total 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, 4's in tens place: 40\n8's in tens place: 39\nDifference so far: 40 - 39 = 1\n\nNow, moving on to the ones place in three-digit numbers.\n\nAgain, let's break it down by hundreds.\n\nFor each hundred group, the ones digit cycles from 0 to 9 every number. So, in each hundred group, the digit 4 appears in the ones place once every ten numbers, so 10 times per hundred. Similarly for 8.\n\nBut let's check each group:\n\n100-199:\n- Ones digit 4: 104,114,124,...,194. That's 10 times.\n- Ones digit 8: 108,118,128,...,198. That's 10 times.\n\n200-299:\n- Ones digit 4: 204,214,...,294. 10 times.\n- Ones digit 8: 208,218,...,298. 10 times.\n\n300-399:\n- Ones digit 4: 304,314,...,394. 10 times.\n- Ones digit 8: 308,318,...,398. 10 times.\n\n400-488:\n- Ones digit 4: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. Let's count: from 404 to 484, that's every 10 numbers. So, 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, but 494 would be beyond 488. So, 9 times.\n- Ones digit 8: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. Let's count: starting from 408, each 10 numbers. So, 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers.\n\nSo, for ones place:\n- 4's: 10+10+10+9 = 39\n- 8's: 10+10+10+9 = 39\nSo, no difference in the ones place.\n\nWait, but wait, in 400-488, the ones digit 4 appears 9 times, and 8 appears 9 times as well. So, in each of the first three hundreds, both digits appear 10 times, and in the last hundred, both appear 9 times. So, total for ones place: 3*10 + 9 = 39 for both 4 and 8.\n\nSo, in the ones place, both digits appear 39 times.\n\nPutting it all together for three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4's: hundreds (89) + tens (40) + ones (39) = 89+40=129+39=168\n- 8's: hundreds (0) + tens (39) + ones (39) = 0+39=39+39=78\n\nWait, that seems high. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, for hundreds place, 4's are 89 times because from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, 89 times.\n\nIn tens place, 4's appear 40 times, as calculated earlier.\n\nIn ones place, 4's appear 39 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89+40+39=168.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nHundreds place: 0\n\nTens place: 39 times\n\nOnes place: 39 times\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: 0+39+39=78.\n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, 4's appear 168 times, 8's appear 78 times.\n\nNow, let's add up all the digits:\n\nFrom one-digit numbers:\n- 4:1, 8:1\n\nFrom two-digit numbers:\n- 4:19, 8:19\n\nFrom three-digit numbers:\n- 4:168, 8:78\n\nTotal 4's: 1 +19 +168 = 188\n\nTotal 8's:1 +19 +78 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a lot. Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me go step by step.\n\nOne-digit numbers:\n- 4:1\n- 8:1\n\nTwo-digit numbers:\n- Tens place:\n  - 4:10\n  - 8:10\n- Ones place:\n  - 4:9\n  - 8:9\nTotal two-digit:\n- 4:10+9=19\n- 8:10+9=19\n\nThree-digit numbers:\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4:89 (from 400-488)\n- 8:0\n\nTens place:\n- 4:40\n- 8:39\n\nOnes place:\n- 4:39\n- 8:39\n\nSo, three-digit:\n- 4:89+40+39=168\n- 8:0+39+39=78\n\nAdding all together:\n\n4's:1 (one-digit) +19 (two-digit) +168 (three-digit) = 1+19=20+168=188\n\n8's:1 (one-digit) +19 (two-digit) +78 (three-digit) =1+19=20+78=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because I might have made a mistake in counting the three-digit numbers. Let me check the three-digit counts again.\n\nFor hundreds place in three-digit numbers, 4's appear 89 times because from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers.\n\nIn tens place:\n- For 4's: in each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times in the first three hundreds and 10 times in 400-488? Wait, no, in 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, so the tens digit 4 would be from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, right? So, yes, 10 times. So, 4's in tens place: 4*10=40.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place:\n- In each of the first three hundreds, 10 times, and in 400-488, 9 times (since 480-488 is 9 numbers). So, 3*10 +9=39.\n\nIn ones place:\n- For 4's: in each hundred, 10 times, so 3*10=30, and in 400-488, 9 times (404,414,...,484). So, 30+9=39.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in ones place: 3*10=30 in first three hundreds, and 9 in 400-488, so 30+9=39.\n\nSo, 4's in ones place:39, 8's in ones place:39.\n\nSo, 4's total in three-digit:89+40+39=168\n\n8's total in three-digit:0+39+39=78\n\nSo, adding up all digits:\n\n4's:1+19+168=188\n\n8's:1+19+78=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nI think that's correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I should consider an alternative approach. Maybe count all the 4's and 8's in each digit place separately across all page numbers.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nTotal page numbers:488\n\nLet's count the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFor units digit, each digit from 0-9 appears equally often, except possibly the last digit if the total isn't a multiple of 10.\n\nTotal numbers:488\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10:48 (since 48*10=480), with 8 remaining numbers (481-488).\n\nIn each group of 10, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place.\n\nSo, for units place:\n- 4 appears 48 times (once per group) plus in the last 8 numbers, 484 has a units digit of 4. So, 48+1=49 times.\n- Similarly, 8 appears 48 times plus in the last 8 numbers, 488 has a units digit of 8. So, 48+1=49 times.\n\nWait, but wait, from 1 to 488, the units digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, for 488 numbers, how many times does each digit appear in units place?\n\nIt's 48 full tens (480 numbers) plus 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, for each digit 0-9, they appear 48 times in the units place. Then, in the last 8 numbers, digits 1-8 appear once each. So, 4 appears once more (484), and 8 appears once more (488). So, total:\n\n4's in units place:48+1=49\n\n8's in units place:48+1=49\n\nTens place:\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in each hundred. So, for 488 numbers, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place?\n\nNumber of hundreds:4 (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Each hundred has 100 numbers, but the last hundred only goes up to 488.\n\nIn each hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for the first three hundreds (100-399), each digit appears 3*10=30 times.\n\nIn the last hundred (400-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last number). So, digits 0-8 appear 9 times each in the tens place (because 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is 9 groups of 10 for each tens digit 0-8). Wait, no, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so for tens digit 0:400-409 (10 numbers), but 400-488 includes 400-409, so that's 10 numbers. Similarly, tens digit 1:410-419, 10 numbers. Up to tens digit 8:480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place for 400-488:\n\n- Digits 0-7: each appear 10 times (for 0:400-409, 10 numbers; same for 1-7)\n- Digit 8: appears 9 times (480-488)\n\nSo, for the tens place:\n\n4's in tens place: in the first three hundreds, 3*10=30. In the last hundred, 10 times (440-449). So, total 30+10=40.\n\n8's in tens place: in the first three hundreds, 3*10=30. In the last hundred, 9 times (480-488). So, total 30+9=39.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nIn hundreds place, digits can be 1,2,3,4.\n\n- Digit 1: appears 100 times (100-199)\n- Digit 2: appears 100 times (200-299)\n- Digit 3: appears 100 times (300-399)\n- Digit 4: appears 89 times (400-488)\n\nSo, 4's in hundreds place:89\n8's in hundreds place:0\n\nNow, summing up:\n\n4's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:40\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+40=89+89=178?\n\nWait, no, 49+40=89, plus 89=178.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 188. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Wait, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, in the units place, I just calculated 49 for 4's, but earlier I had 39 in three-digit numbers. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the approaches.\n\nWait, in the initial approach, I considered one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers separately, but in this alternative approach, I'm considering all numbers from 1 to 488, so perhaps I should adjust.\n\nWait, in the first approach, for one-digit numbers, 4 appears once in units place. For two-digit numbers, 4 appears 9 times in units place (14,24,...,94) and 10 times in tens place (40-49). For three-digit numbers, 4 appears 39 times in units place (104,114,...,394,404-484), 40 times in tens place, and 89 times in hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's:1 (one-digit) +9 (two-digit units) +10 (two-digit tens) +39 (three-digit units) +40 (three-digit tens) +89 (three-digit hundreds) =1+9=10+10=20+39=59+40=99+89=188.\n\nIn the alternative approach, I considered all numbers from 1 to 488, and calculated units, tens, and hundreds places separately. But in that approach, I got 49 units, 40 tens, 89 hundreds for 4's, totaling 49+40+89=178, which doesn't match the first approach. So, I must have made a mistake in one of the approaches.\n\nWait, perhaps the alternative approach is incorrect because in the units place, I counted 49, but in the first approach, it's 49 (from 1 to 488) but in the first approach, I had 1 (one-digit) +9 (two-digit) +39 (three-digit) =49. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, in the first approach, I had 10 (two-digit) +40 (three-digit) =50 for 4's in tens place. But in the alternative approach, I have 40 for 4's in tens place. Wait, that's a discrepancy. Wait, in the first approach, two-digit tens place for 4's is 10, and three-digit tens place for 4's is 40, so total 50. But in the alternative approach, I have 40 for tens place. So, that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the alternative approach. Let me re-examine.\n\nIn the alternative approach, I considered the tens place across all numbers from 1 to 488. So, for the tens digit, each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit 0-9 in the tens place, except the last hundred which only goes up to 488.\n\nWait, but in the first approach, for two-digit numbers, the tens place for 4's is 10 (40-49). So, in the alternative approach, I should include that as well. So, perhaps I didn't account for two-digit numbers in the alternative approach.\n\nWait, in the alternative approach, I considered all numbers from 1 to 488, so the two-digit numbers are included. So, perhaps I need to adjust the alternative approach to include the two-digit numbers correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to stick with the first approach, where I separated one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers, and that gave me 188 4's and 98 8's, a difference of 90.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place across all numbers from 1 to 488, including one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nUnits place:\n- From 1 to 488, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place (since 488 /10=48.8). But actually, for 488 numbers, each digit appears 48 times, and the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have digits 1-8 in the units place. So, 4 appears 48+1=49 times, 8 appears 48+1=49 times.\n\nTens place:\n- Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the tens place (since each hundred has 10 occurrences per digit, and there are 4 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, no, for the tens place, in each hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for the first three hundreds (100-399), each digit appears 3*10=30 times. In the last hundred (400-488), the tens digit goes up to 8, so digits 0-8 appear 9 times each (since 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is 9 groups of 10 for each tens digit 0-8). So, for the tens place:\n  - 4's:30 (from first three hundreds) +10 (from 440-449) =40\n  - 8's:30 (from first three hundreds) +9 (from 480-488) =39\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's:89 times (400-488)\n- 8's:0 times\n\nSo, total 4's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:40\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+40=89+89=178\n\nTotal 8's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:39\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+39=88\n\nDifference:178-88=90\n\nWait, so now I get 90 more 4's than 8's, which matches the first approach. So, earlier when I thought I had a discrepancy, I must have made a mistake in the alternative approach.\n\nSo, the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but in the first approach, I had 188 4's and 98 8's, which also gives a difference of 90. So, both methods agree.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **One-Digit Page Numbers (1-9):**\n   - Both 4 and 8 appear once.\n   - Count: 4's = 1, 8's = 1.\n\n2. **Two-Digit Page Numbers (10-99):**\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - 4 appears 10 times (40-49).\n     - 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - 4 appears 9 times (14, 24, ..., 94).\n     - 8 appears 9 times (18, 28, ..., 98).\n   - Total for two-digit numbers:\n     - 4's: 10 + 9 = 19.\n     - 8's: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\n3. **Three-Digit Page Numbers (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n     - 8 appears 0 times.\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - 4 appears 10 times in each of the first three hundreds (100-399) and 10 times in 400-488 (440-449).\n     - Total: 4*10 = 40.\n     - 8 appears 10 times in each of the first three hundreds and 9 times in 400-488 (480-488).\n     - Total: 3*10 + 9 = 39.\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - 4 appears 10 times in each of the first three hundreds and 9 times in 400-488 (404, 414, ..., 484).\n     - Total: 3*10 + 9 = 39.\n     - 8 appears similarly 39 times.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **4's:**\n     - One-digit: 1\n     - Two-digit: 19\n     - Three-digit: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\n     - Total: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n   - **8's:**\n     - One-digit: 1\n     - Two-digit: 19\n     - Three-digit: 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n     - Total: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488, and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the count of 8's from the count of 4's to find the difference. That seems logical.\n\nLet me start by considering how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488, which is a three-digit number. So, I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nI think the approach here is to count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers from 1 to 488. Then, sum them up for each digit and compare the totals.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place.\n   - From 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and an extra 8 numbers (481 to 488).\n   - So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times in the complete blocks. Now, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So, total 4's in units place: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers.\n   - So, in every block of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n   - From 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 100 are there? 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Then, the remaining 88 numbers (401-488).\n   - So, in the tens place, 4 appears 4 * 10 = 40 times in the complete blocks. Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 (since 401-488 is 88 numbers, which is 8 full tens places: 0-8, each appearing 10 times except maybe the last one? Wait, no. Let me think.\n\nWait, from 401 to 488, the tens digit starts at 0 (401-410), then 1 (411-420), up to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears exactly 10 times except the last one, which is only 8 times (since 481-488 is 8 numbers). Wait, no, because from 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490), but since we stop at 488, the tens digit 8 only appears 8 times (481-488). Wait, but actually, 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for each of those 8 numbers. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place from 401-488? Well, the tens digit is 4 in the block 441-450. Wait, no, 441-450 would have tens digit 4, but that's within the 401-488 range. Wait, no, 441-450 is within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, in the remaining 88 numbers, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. Therefore, total 4's in tens place: 4*10 (from the complete blocks) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50.\n\nWait, but wait, 401-488 is 88 numbers, which is 8 full tens (0-8), each appearing 10 times except maybe the last one. Wait, no, 88 is 8*10 + 8, so the tens digits go from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except the last one, which appears 8 times. But in this case, the tens digit 4 is within 0-8, so it appears 10 times in 401-488. So, yes, 10 times. So, total 4's in tens place: 4*10 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n   - So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but wait, page numbers start at 1, so pages 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit. So, from 100 onwards, the hundreds digit starts. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89.\n\nLet me add that up: 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that because I might have made a mistake in the tens place.\n\nWait, when I was counting the tens place, I considered that from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. But actually, in the range 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, right? So that's correct. So, yes, 10 times. So, 4*10 + 10 = 50 in the tens place.\n\nAnd in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to the 4's, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - From 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 48 complete blocks (1-480), and then 481-488 is 8 numbers.\n   - So, in the units place, 8 appears 48 times in the complete blocks. Now, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once (488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles 0-9 every 100 numbers. Each digit appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers.\n   - So, in each block of 100, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 4 complete blocks of 100 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 numbers (401-488).\n   - So, in the complete blocks, 4*10 = 40 times.\n   - Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's 9 times. But wait, 480 is included in 401-488, right? 480 is 480, which is within 401-488.\n\nWait, so in the tens place from 401-488, the digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 times.\n\nTherefore, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait, is 480 included in 401-488? Yes, because 401 starts at 401, and 480 is between 401 and 488. So, yes, 480 is included, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, 9 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because 800 is beyond 488. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, so total 8's are 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, in the tens place, 40 (from the complete blocks) + 9 = 49.\n\nUnits place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n**Rechecking 4's:**\n\n- Units place: 48 times. Because from 1-488, there are 48 complete decades (each contributing one 4 in units place), and 488 mod 10 is 8, so the last partial decade doesn't include a 4 in units place. So, 48.\n\n- Tens place: 50 times. Because in each 100 numbers, 10 times in tens place, so 4*10=40, plus in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, 40+10=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 times. From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in hundreds place.\n\nTotal 4's: 48+50+89=187.\n\n**Rechecking 8's:**\n\n- Units place: 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in 481-488, the units digit 8 occurs once (488). So, 48+1=49.\n\n- Tens place: 4 complete centuries, each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 40+9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nHmm, so that would mean there are 89 more 4's than 8's. But I feel like that might be a lot. Let me see if there's another way to approach this, maybe by considering each digit place separately and ensuring I didn't overcount or undercount.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use a formula for counting digits. For each digit place, the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to N can be calculated using a standard method.\n\nLet me try that for units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**General method for counting digit d in position k:**\n\nFor a given digit position (units, tens, hundreds), the count of digit d can be calculated as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote the current position as the k-th digit (starting from the right, with units as position 1, tens as position 2, etc.).\n\nLet higher = number formed by digits to the left of the current position.\n\nLet current = the digit at the current position.\n\nLet lower = number formed by digits to the right of the current position.\n\nThen, the count is:\n\n- If current > d: count += (higher + 1) * 10^(k-1)\n- If current == d: count += higher * 10^(k-1) + (lower + 1)\n- If current < d: count += higher * 10^(k-1)\n\nBut I need to adjust this for when d is 0, because numbers don't have leading zeros. Hmm, but since we're dealing with digits 4 and 8, which are non-zero, maybe this won't complicate things too much.\n\nLet me try applying this formula to count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place.\n\nBut maybe this is overcomplicating. Alternatively, I can think of each digit place separately.\n\nWait, maybe I can use a different approach by considering how many times each digit appears in each position up to 488.\n\nLet me try for the 4's:\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n\n- **Units place:**\n  - For every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete 10s are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete 10s, each contributing one 4. So, 48*1=48.\n\n- **Tens place:**\n  - For every 100 numbers, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 appears 10 times per 100 numbers.\n  - From 1 to 488, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). So, 4*10=40.\n  - Now, from 401-488, which is 88 numbers, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The digit 4 appears in the tens place in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 more.\n  - Total tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n- **Hundreds place:**\n  - The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. So, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n\n- **Units place:**\n  - For every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete 10s, each contributing one 8. So, 48*1=48.\n  - Now, the last partial 10 is 481-488, which includes 488, so units digit 8 appears once more. So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- **Tens place:**\n  - For every 100 numbers, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 8 appears 10 times per 100.\n  - From 1 to 488, 4 complete hundreds, so 4*10=40.\n  - From 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 9 more.\n  - Total tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n- **Hundreds place:**\n  - The hundreds digit is 8 only from 800-899, but since our book ends at 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check that again.\n\nIn the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480 is the start, and 488 is the end. So, 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, 9 times. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, from 1-488, the number of 8's is 48 (from each 10) plus 1 more in 488, totaling 49.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure because 89 seems like a large number. Let me try a different approach by considering each digit place for both 4 and 8 and adding them up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write out the counts for each digit place separately.\n\n**Alternative approach:**\n\nLet me consider each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) and count how many 4's and 8's appear in each.\n\n**Units place:**\n\n- 4's: As before, 48 times.\n- 8's: 49 times.\n\n**Tens place:**\n\n- 4's: 50 times.\n- 8's: 49 times.\n\n**Hundreds place:**\n\n- 4's: 89 times.\n- 8's: 0 times.\n\nSo, adding them up:\n\n- 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n- 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nHmm, same result. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nAnd for the 8's, since 800 is beyond 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the difference is 89.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in a smaller range, say up to 50 pages, and see if the method holds.\n\nFor example, up to 50 pages:\n\n- 4's: Units place: 4,14,24,34,44 \u2192 5 times. Tens place: 40-49 \u2192 10 times. Hundreds place: 0. Total 4's: 15.\n\n- 8's: Units place: 8,18,28,38,48 \u2192 5 times. Tens place: 40-49 has 48, but wait, 48 is in the units place as well. Wait, in the tens place, 80-89 would be 8's, but up to 50, there are no 8's in the tens place. So, units place: 5, tens place: 0. Total 8's: 5.\n\nDifference: 15 - 5 = 10.\n\nWait, using my previous method:\n\n- Units place for 4's: 50 / 10 = 5, so 5 times. But wait, 44 is included, so 5 times.\n\n- Tens place for 4's: 10 times (40-49).\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 4's: 5 + 10 = 15.\n\nUnits place for 8's: 50 / 10 = 5, so 5 times.\n\nTens place for 8's: 0, since up to 50, the tens digit 8 doesn't appear.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 5.\n\nDifference: 15 - 5 = 10.\n\nWhich is correct, as the actual count is 15 4's and 5 8's.\n\nSo, my method seems to work for a smaller number, so I think it's correct.\n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the difference is 89.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When counting the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times. But in the hundreds place, each number contributes one 4, so that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. That's correct.\n\nI think I've considered all the cases correctly. So, I'm confident that the answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (once every 10 numbers).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (10 per 100 numbers, plus 10 in 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488).\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (48 from complete decades, plus 1 in 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (40 from complete centuries, plus 9 in 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Hmm, let's think about it step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably consider each digit place separately: the units place and the tens place. Because when counting page numbers, each page has a number that can be one or two digits, right? So pages 1 to 9 are single-digit, and from 10 onwards, they're two digits. Maybe I should break it down into single-digit and two-digit pages.\n\nWait, but actually, even single-digit pages can be thought of as having a tens place with zero, like 01, 02, etc., but maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, I can handle units and tens separately without worrying about leading zeros.\n\nSo, let's start by considering how many times the digit 4 appears in the units place and how many times it appears in the tens place. Similarly, I'll do the same for the digit 8.\n\nLet me think about the units place first. For every set of ten consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles through 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place, right? Like 4, 14, 24, etc. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once every ten numbers, like 8, 18, 28, etc.\n\nNow, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten, and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). So, in each of those 48 sets, the units digit 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Similarly, the units digit 8 appears 48 times.\n\nBut wait, the extra 8 numbers from 481 to 488: in those, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 484 have a 4 in the units place? Yes, 484. So that's one more 4 in the units place, making it 49 times. Similarly, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, so that's one more 8 in the units place, making it 49 times.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 481 to 488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 484 is 484, so units digit is 4, and 488 is 488, units digit is 8. So, yes, that adds one more 4 and one more 8 in the units place. So, units place total for 4 is 48 + 1 = 49, and for 8 it's 48 + 1 = 49. So, same number of 4's and 8's in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 ten times (40-49), and 8 ten times (80-89). So, in each block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times as well.\n\nNow, how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds, and then 88 extra pages.\n\nSo, in each of the 4 complete hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, the remaining 88 pages are from 401 to 488. Wait, no, actually, 400 pages would be up to page 400, so the next 88 pages are 401 to 488. Wait, but maybe I should think of the tens digit in the range 401-488.\n\nWait, perhaps I should break it down differently. Let's see, from 1 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in each 100, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, as in 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider the tens digit in the last partial hundred, which is 401-488. Wait, but 401-488 is 88 pages, which is 8 full tens (401-410, 411-420, etc.) and 8 more pages. Wait, but the tens digit in 401-488 is 0 for 401-410? No, wait, 401 is 401, so the tens digit is 0, right? Because 401 is 4 0 1. So, the tens digit is 0, and then 410 is 4 1 0, so the tens digit is 1, and so on.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think: the tens digit in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409), 1 (410-419), 2 (420-429), 3 (430-439), 4 (440-449), 5 (450-459), 6 (460-469), 7 (470-479), and 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for each of them, right? Because 480 is 4 8 0, 481 is 4 8 1, up to 488, which is 4 8 8. So, that's 9 times the digit 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, so in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and the tens digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, in total, across all pages:\n\n- For the tens digit 4: 4 complete hundreds * 10 times each = 40, plus 10 times in 440-449, so total 50 times.\n- For the tens digit 8: 4 complete hundreds * 10 times each = 40, plus 9 times in 480-488, so total 49 times.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me check again. Each complete hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place, so 4 hundreds give 40 for both 4 and 8. Then, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total for tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8.\n\nNow, let me sum up the total number of 4's and 8's.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 = 99 times.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98 times.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 99, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there is one more 4 than 8.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me recount.\n\nUnits place:\n- Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once, 8 appears once.\n- 488 divided by 10 is 48 full sets, each contributing 1 to both 4 and 8.\n- Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n- So, units: 48 + 1 = 49 for both.\n\nTens place:\n- Every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, same for 8.\n- 488 divided by 100 is 4 full sets, so 4*10=40 for both.\n- The remaining 88 numbers (401-488) have tens digits from 0 to 8.\n- In this range, 4 appears in 440-449: 10 times.\n- 8 appears in 480-488: 9 times.\n- So, tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8.\n\nAdding up:\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98\n\nSo, 99 - 98 = 1. So, there is one more 4 than 8.\n\nWait, but I feel like I might have made a mistake in the tens place for the last partial hundred. Let me double-check.\n\nFrom 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-409) to 8 (480-488). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 times.\n\nHow many times does 8 appear in the tens place? From 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488). So, 9 times.\n\nSo, yes, in the last partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 9 times. So, adding to the 40 from the complete hundreds, 4 has 50 and 8 has 49 in the tens place.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98\nDifference: 99 - 98 = 1\n\nTherefore, there is one more 4 than 8.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I count the units place, I have 488 pages. So, the units digit cycles every 10 pages, so 488 / 10 = 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) contribute one more 4 and one more 8, so units total is 49 for both.\n\nIn the tens place, each hundred contributes 10 times for each digit. So, 4 complete hundreds (1-400) contribute 4*10=40 for each digit. Then, from 401-488, which is 88 pages, we have:\n\n- Tens digit 4: 440-449, which is 10 times.\n- Tens digit 8: 480-488, which is 9 times.\n\nSo, adding to the 40 from the complete hundreds, 4's tens place is 50, 8's is 49.\n\nSo, 4's total: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99\n8's total: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98\nDifference: 99 - 98 = 1\n\nSo, one more 4 than 8.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 1 more 4 than 8.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 99, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there is one more 4 than 8.\n\n$\\boxed{1}$"

    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, I'll need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and do the same for the digit 8, then compare the totals.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For every group of ten consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. Now, how many such groups are there from 1 to 488?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, there are 48 full groups of ten and then an extra 8 pages (481-488). So, in each of these 48 full groups, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place, giving 48 each. Now, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1 through 8. So, does 4 appear here? Yes, at 484. So, that's one more 4. For 8, it's at 488, so that's one more 8. So, units place total for 4 is 48 + 1 = 49, and for 8, it's 48 + 1 = 49 as well. So, in the units place, both digits appear the same number of times.\n\nNext, let's move to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each (in 1-10, it's 0; 11-20, it's 1, etc.). So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and the same for 8 (80-89). So, how many hundreds do we have here?\n\n488 is less than 500, so we have four full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, that's actually five sets, but 401-488 is only 88 numbers, not a full hundred.\n\nWait, let me correct that. From 1 to 488, the hundreds go up to 400, and then 401-488 is the next set. So, how many full hundreds are there? Each hundred is 100 pages, so 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. That's four full hundreds, each contributing 10 instances of 4 and 10 instances of 8 in the tens place. So, 4 times 10 is 40 for both 4 and 8 so far.\n\nNow, the last partial hundred is 401-488. Let's look at the tens digit here. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 in this range. So, the tens digit for 401-409 is 0, 410-419 is 1, and so on up to 480-488, where the tens digit is 8. So, in this partial hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 more 4's. For 8, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9. So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, adding up the tens place: 40 (from the four full hundreds) + 10 (from 401-488 for 4) = 50 for 4. For 8, it's 40 + 9 = 49. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place?\n\nFor 4, it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nFor 8, the hundreds digit would be 8 if the pages were 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total for hundreds place: 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences.\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal for 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal for 8: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 48 full groups of 10, each contributing 1 to 4 and 1 to 8. Then, 481-488 gives one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488). So, 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each full hundred (1-100, etc.) gives 10 each for 4 and 8. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit for 4 occurs 10 times (440-449), and for 8, it's 9 times (480-488). So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8. That adds up.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 doesn't appear at all. So, 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nAdding up: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 for 4. 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 for 8.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I was counting the tens place in 401-488, I considered 440-449 as 10 numbers, which is correct. For 8, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 more 8's. That seems right.\n\nWait, but in the units place, from 481-488, units digits are 1-8, so 484 has a 4 in the units place, and 488 has an 8. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my total is correct. 4 appears 188 times, 8 appears 98 times, so 188 - 98 = 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because 488 is a high number, so maybe I missed something. Let me check each digit place again.\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of complete decades (groups of 10): floor(488 / 10) = 48, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units: 48 + 1 = 49 for both. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4 (40-49, 140-149, etc.) and 10 where it's 8 (80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are 4 full hundreds (1-400), so 4 * 10 = 40 for 4 and 40 for 8.\n\nThen, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449 (10 numbers) and 8 in 480-488 (9 numbers). So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, 40 + 9 = 49 for 8. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo, totals:\n\n4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's right. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 488 is a large number, and maybe I'm overcounting in the hundreds place. Let me check the hundreds place again.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 4's. Correct.\n\nAnd since the book ends at 488, there's no page 800, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my earlier calculation is accurate. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers from 1 to 488, then finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each group of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - Total groups of 10: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8).\n   - Remaining pages: 481-488, contributing one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 4's (e.g., 40-49) and 10 8's (e.g., 80-89).\n   - Four full hundreds (1-400) contribute 4\u00d710=40 each.\n   - In 401-488:\n     - 440-449 contributes 10 4's.\n     - 480-488 contributes 9 8's.\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 contribute 89 4's (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89.\n   - Total 8's: 0.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe digit 4 is printed 90 times more than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should consider each digit place separately: the units place and the tens place. Maybe even the hundreds place if needed. Because the number of times a digit appears in each place can be calculated separately, and then I can add them up.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For every set of ten pages, like 1-10, 11-20, and so on, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, in 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So each digit appears once every ten pages.\n\nNow, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten and then 8 extra pages. So, for the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times. But wait, that's not quite right because the last 8 pages (481-488) will have units digits from 1 to 8, so digits 9 and 0 don't appear in the last partial set.\n\nWait, but for the units digit, I think each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times in the first 480 pages (48 sets of ten). Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so digits 1 through 8 each appear once more. So, for the units place, the count for each digit is:\n\n- For digits 1-8: 48 (from the complete sets) + 1 (from the last 8 pages) = 49 times.\n- For digits 9 and 0: 48 times each.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because in the last 8 pages, units digits are 1-8, so digits 1-8 each get an extra count. So, for 4 in the units place, it would be 48 +1 = 49 times. Similarly, 8 would be 48 +1 =49 times. Hmm, but maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, let me think again. Each complete set of ten pages contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 complete sets, that's 48 times each. Then, in the last 8 pages, which are 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once more in 484, and 8 appears once more in 488. So, the total for 4 in units place is 48 +1=49, and same for 8: 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, but actually, in 481-488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, yes, 4 and 8 each appear once more. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. So, in each block of 100 pages, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place per 100 pages.\n\nNow, since the book has 488 pages, that's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each of these 4 hundreds, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 times 10 is 40 times for each digit in the tens place.\n\nBut then we have the remaining 88 pages, which are 401-488. Let's see how the tens digit behaves here. From 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), and 7 (471-480). Then, from 481-488, the tens digit is 8, but wait, 481-488 is only 8 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 for 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, the tens digit for 481-488 is 8, appearing 8 times.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 401-410, the tens digit is 0 (401-410). Then 411-420: tens digit 1, 421-430: 2, 431-440:3, 441-450:4, 451-460:5, 461-470:6, 471-480:7, and 481-488:8. So, each of these blocks is 10 pages except the last one, which is 8 pages. So, the tens digits in 401-488 are:\n\n- 0: 10 times (401-410)\n- 1: 10 times (411-420)\n- 2:10 times (421-430)\n- 3:10 times (431-440)\n- 4:10 times (441-450)\n- 5:10 times (451-460)\n- 6:10 times (461-470)\n- 7:10 times (471-480)\n- 8:8 times (481-488)\n\nSo, in the tens place, each digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times in the last block.\n\nWait, but we have 4 full hundreds before 401, so in the tens place, each digit 0-9 appears 40 times (4*10). Now, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digits are as above.\n\nSo, for the tens place, the count for each digit is:\n\n- For digits 0-7: 40 (from the first 400 pages) +10 (from 401-480) =50 times each.\n- For digit 8: 40 (from first 400) +8 (from 481-488) =48 times.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because in the first 400 pages, each digit appears 40 times in the tens place, correct. Then, in 401-488, the tens digits are as I listed. So, for digits 0-7, each appears 10 more times, making it 50 each. For digit 8, it's 8 more times, making it 40+8=48 times.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, does 481-488 have 8 pages where the tens digit is 8? Let me check: 481,482,...,488. The tens digit is 8, so yes, 8 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times (since it's in 441-450, which is 10 pages), and 8 appears 48 times (40 times from first 400 pages plus 8 times in 481-488).\n\nWait, but let me make sure. From 401-488, the tens digit for 4 is in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. So, in the first 400 pages, 4 appears 40 times in the tens place, and then 10 more times in 401-488, making it 50 times total. Similarly, 8 appears 40 times in the first 400 pages, and then 8 more times in 481-488, making it 48 times.\n\nSo, for the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 48 times.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (400-488 inclusive). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, which is less than 800.\n\nWait, but wait: 400-488 is 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all.\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each place.\n\nStarting with 4:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place:89 times\nTotal for 4: 49 +50 +89 = 188 times.\n\nNow for 8:\n\n- Units place:49 times\n- Tens place:48 times\n- Hundreds place:0 times\nTotal for 8:49 +48 +0=97 times.\n\nSo, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 -97=91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n- Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the first 480 pages.\n- Then, in 481-488, units digits are 1-8, so 4 and 8 each get an extra count.\n- So, units place: 48 +1=49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nTens place:\n\n- First 400 pages: each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place.\n- From 401-488:\n  - 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 times)\n  - 411-420:1 (10)\n  - 421-430:2 (10)\n  - 431-440:3 (10)\n  - 441-450:4 (10)\n  - 451-460:5 (10)\n  - 461-470:6 (10)\n  - 471-480:7 (10)\n  - 481-488:8 (8)\n- So, for 4: 40 (from first 400) +10 (from 441-450) =50\n- For 8:40 (from first 400) +8 (from 481-488)=48\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0=97\nDifference:188-97=91\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But let me check if I considered all the digits correctly, especially in the tens place.\n\nWait, in the tens place, for 401-488, the tens digits go up to 8, but only for 8 pages. So, 8 appears 8 times in the tens place. So, in the first 400 pages, 8 appears 40 times in the tens place, and then 8 more times, making it 48. That seems right.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, which is correct because from 400 to 488 is 89 pages. So, 89 times.\n\nUnits place: each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times in the first 480 pages, and then in the last 8 pages, 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so each of those digits gets an extra count. So, 4 and 8 each get 49 counts in the units place.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0=97\nDifference:188-97=91\n\nWait, but let me think again: when I calculated the units place, I considered that each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times in the first 480 pages, and then in the last 8 pages, 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so each digit from 1-8 gets an extra count. So, 4 and 8 each get 48 +1=49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 40 times in the first 400 pages. Then, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, with 0-7 each appearing 10 times, and 8 appearing 8 times. So, for 4, it's 40 +10=50, and for 8, it's 40 +8=48.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 doesn't appear at all.\n\nSo, adding up, 4 appears 49+50+89=188 times, and 8 appears 49+48=97 times. So, the difference is 188-97=91.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the first 480 pages.\n   - In the last 8 pages (481-488), digits 1-8 each appear once more.\n   - Total for 4: 48 +1 =49\n   - Total for 8: 48 +1 =49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the first 400 pages.\n   - From 401-488:\n     - 4 appears 10 more times (441-450).\n     - 8 appears 8 more times (481-488).\n   - Total for 4: 40 +10 =50\n   - Total for 8: 40 +8 =48\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - 4: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188\n   - 8: 49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 =97\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) -97 (8's) =91\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{91}."

    "text": " Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that each page number is printed once, from 1 to 488. So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times 8 appears, then find the difference between those two counts.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to break down the problem by looking at each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. That way, I can count the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each place and sum them up.\n\nLet's start with the units place. In the units place, the digits cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times a specific digit appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10.\n\nWait, but 488 isn't a multiple of 10. So, I guess I need to consider how many complete blocks of 10 there are and then handle the remaining numbers.\n\nFor the units place:\n- The number of complete blocks of 10 in 488 pages is 48 (since 48 * 10 = 480), and then there are 8 remaining pages (481 to 488).\n- In each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, for 48 blocks, that's 48 times.\n- Now, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1 through 8. So, 4 doesn't appear here because 484 is beyond 488, right? Wait, 484 is page 484, which is within the book. Wait, no, 484 is page 484, which is less than 488, so actually, in the remaining 8 pages, page 484 is included. So, the units digit 4 appears once more.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So yes, 4 appears once in the units place here. So, total for units place: 48 + 1 = 49 times for digit 4.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8 in the units place:\n- Each block of 10 has one 8 in the units place, so 48 blocks give 48 times.\n- In the remaining 8 pages, the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once (page 488).\n- So, total for units place: 48 + 1 = 49 times for digit 8.\n\nWait, so both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place. So, the count so far is equal.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, up to 9 for 90-99. So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place per hundred.\n\nSo, for the tens place:\n- The total number of pages is 488, which is 4 full hundreds (1-400) and 88 pages (401-488).\n- In each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n- Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? From 440-449, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 pages. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 times.\n- So, total for tens place: 40 (from the full hundreds) + 10 (from the remaining pages) = 50 times for digit 4.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8 in the tens place:\n- In each hundred, 8 appears in the tens place 10 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n- In the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 9 times.\n- So, total for tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 times for digit 8.\n\nWait, so for the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. So, 50 - 49 = 1 more 4 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards, and in this case, the book goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n- For digit 4 in the hundreds place: It appears from page 400 to 488. That's 89 pages (400-488 inclusive). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n- For digit 8 in the hundreds place: Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, for the hundreds place:\n- Digit 4 appears 89 times.\n- Digit 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times more than 8.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor digit 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nFor digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (for 4) - 98 (for 8) = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n- For 488 pages, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place (since 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles and 8 extra). For 4, in the units place, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digit is 1-8, so 4 appears once. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly for 8, same calculation: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n- For 488 pages, each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 40 for each digit. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. For 4, it's from 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4.\n\nFor 8, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488 inclusive). So, 40 + 9 = 49 for 8.\n\nHundreds place:\n- For 4, it's from 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, 89 times.\n- For 8, it's 0.\n\nAdding up:\n- 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n- 8: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me check another way. Maybe I can think of it as the total number of digits and see if this makes sense.\n\nTotal number of digits printed:\n\nFrom 1-9: 9 digits\nFrom 10-99: 90 numbers, each with 2 digits: 180 digits\nFrom 100-488: 389 numbers, each with 3 digits: 1167 digits\nTotal digits: 9 + 180 + 1167 = 1356 digits.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps directly, but maybe it can help cross-verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of how many times each digit appears in each place.\n\nWait, another approach: For each digit place, calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n- As before, 49 times each.\n\nTens place:\n- 50 for 4, 49 for 8.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nSo, adding up: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 for 4; 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 for 8.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place for the first 480 pages.\n   - Pages 481-488 add one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488).\n   - Total: 49 each.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times per hundred. For 488 pages, 4 appears 50 times (40-49, 140-149, etc.), and 8 appears 49 times (80-89, etc., plus 480-488).\n   - Total: 50 for 4, 49 for 8.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 appears 0 times.\n   - Total: 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nSumming these:\n- Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- Total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should consider each digit place separately: the units place and the tens place. Maybe I can count how many times 4 appears in each place and then do the same for 8, then subtract the two totals to find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For every block of 10 pages (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks and a partial block of 8 pages. So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 times from the full blocks and then once more in the 481-488 range because 484 has a 4 in the units place. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 481-488 is the 48th block, right? Wait, no, actually, each block is 10 pages. So, 10 pages per block, so 48 blocks would cover up to page 480. Then, pages 481-488 are the 49th block, but it's only 8 pages. So, in the units place, how many times does 4 appear in the 481-488 range? Well, 484 would be the only one with a 4 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 (from the full blocks) plus 1, totaling 49.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 1 to 480, there are 48 blocks, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then from 481 to 488, which is 8 pages, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place, so that's 1 more, making it 49. That seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, 4 appears in a block of 100 pages. For example, in 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 pages. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block from 401-488.\n\nIn each full block, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 blocks times 10 is 40 times. Now, in the partial block from 401-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Well, 401-499 would have 10 instances, but since we're only going up to 488, it's from 401-488. The tens digit is 4 for pages 401-410, 411-420, etc., but wait, actually, in the tens place, it's 4 for 400-499, but since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit is 4 from 400-488. Wait, no, 400 is page 400, but 400 is part of the 301-400 block, right? Wait, no, 301-400 is the fourth block. Then 401-500 would be the fifth block, but we only go up to 488. So, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for pages 401-410, 411-420, 421-430, 431-440, 441-450, 451-460, 461-470, 471-480, and 481-488. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the tens digit is 4 for any page where the tens digit is 4, regardless of the hundreds digit. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for pages 401-410, 411-420, etc., but actually, in each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9. So, in the 400s, the tens digit is 4 for 401-410, but wait, 400 is part of the 301-400 block, right? Wait, maybe I'm complicating this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think that in the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears equally in each hundred. So, in each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, from 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, so 4 times 10 is 40 times. Then, from 401-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Well, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for pages 401-410, 411-420, 421-430, 431-440, 441-450, 451-460, 461-470, 471-480, and 481-488. Wait, but that's not correct because 401-488 is only 88 pages, so the tens digit 4 would occur in 401-410 (10 pages), 411-420 (10 pages), 421-430 (10 pages), 431-440 (10 pages), 441-450 (10 pages), 451-460 (10 pages), 461-470 (10 pages), 471-480 (10 pages), and then 481-488, where the tens digit is 8, right? Wait, no, 481-488: 481 has 8 in the tens place, 482 has 8, etc., up to 488. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 401-480, which is 80 pages, meaning 8 times 10, so 80 times, but that can't be right because from 401-480, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. Wait, no, that's not correct because 401-480 is 80 pages, which is 8 sets of 10. So, the tens digit 4 would appear once every 10 pages, so 8 times in the tens place. Wait, but that would mean in 401-480, the tens digit 4 appears 8 times, each in a block of 10 pages, like 401-410, 411-420, etc., up to 471-480. So, that's 8 times. Then, from 481-488, the tens digit is 8, so no more 4's in the tens place. So, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 4 appears 8 times. Therefore, total 4's in the tens place would be 40 (from 1-400) plus 8, totaling 48.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought in each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4 hundreds would be 40 times, and then in 401-488, it's another 8 times, making it 48. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me verify that. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49). Similarly, in 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10 times. So, each hundred contributes 10 times. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) would be 40 times. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 401-410, 411-420, 421-430, 431-440, 441-450, 451-460, 461-470, and 471-480, each block of 10 pages, so that's 8 blocks, each contributing one 4 in the tens place, so 8 times. So, total 40 + 8 = 48 times in the tens place for 4.\n\nNow, let's check for 8's. So, I need to do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. In every block of 10 pages, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-480, there are 48 blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, from 481-488, the units digit is 8 only in 488, so that's one more. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place for 8.\n\nNow, for the tens place. In each block of 100 pages, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, from 1-400, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 times, so 40 times. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. Wait, but 480 is part of the 401-500 range, right? So, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place here? Well, 480-488 is 9 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 times. Therefore, total 8's in the tens place would be 40 (from 1-400) plus 9, totaling 49.\n\nWait, but let me think again. In the range 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-488. But 480 is part of the 401-500 block, so in that block, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, that's 9 times. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place for 8.\n\nWait, but earlier for 4's in the tens place, I had 48 times, and for 8's in the tens place, 49 times. So, the total 8's in the tens place would be 49, and 4's in the tens place would be 48. So, 8's have one more in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because I might have made a mistake. So, from 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 times, so 40 times. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let me sum up the total number of 4's and 8's.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\nTotal 4's: 49 + 48 = 97\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nWait, so total 4's are 97, and total 8's are 98. So, 8's are more by 1. But the question is asking how many more 4's than 8's, which would be 97 - 98 = -1, which would mean 8's are more by 1. But that contradicts the initial thought. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me double-check the counts.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nUnits place:\n- From 1-480: 48 blocks, each contributing 1, so 48.\n- 481-488: 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place, so 1.\nTotal: 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n- From 1-400: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40.\n- 401-488: The tens digit 4 appears in 401-410, 411-420, ..., 471-480. That's 8 blocks of 10, so 8 times.\nTotal: 40 + 8 = 48. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place:\n- From 1-480: 48 blocks, each contributing 1, so 48.\n- 481-488: 488 has an 8 in the units place, so 1.\nTotal: 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n- From 1-400: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40.\n- 401-488: Tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 times.\nTotal: 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nTherefore, 4's: 97, 8's: 98. So, 8's are more by 1. But the question is asking how many more 4's than 8's, which would be 97 - 98 = -1. But since we can't have negative counts, it means 8's are more by 1. So, the answer would be that 4's are printed 1 fewer than 8's, meaning 8's are more by 1. But the question is phrased as \"how many more 4's are printed than 8's,\" so the answer would be -1, but since we can't have negative, maybe 0? Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, that's 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the hundreds place. Wait, the hundreds digit for 488 is 4, but we're only considering page numbers up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, does the hundreds digit affect the count? For example, in page 400, the hundreds digit is 4, but we're only counting the digits in the units and tens place. So, the hundreds digit doesn't contribute to 4's or 8's in the units or tens place, except when the hundreds digit is 4 or 8, but that affects the units and tens digits as part of the page number. Wait, no, the hundreds digit is separate. So, for example, page 400 has 4 in the hundreds place, 0 in the tens, and 0 in the units. So, the hundreds digit doesn't contribute to the count of 4's or 8's in the units or tens place.\n\nWait, but in page 488, the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit is 8, and the units digit is 8. So, that page contributes one 4 in the hundreds place, one 8 in the tens place, and one 8 in the units place. But in our earlier counts, we were only considering the tens and units places, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should also consider the hundreds place for 4's and 8's. Let me think. The problem says \"each page number is printed one time,\" and \"when printing all of the page numbers.\" So, do we need to consider the hundreds digit as well? For example, page 400 has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that would count as a 4. Similarly, page 800 would have an 8 in the hundreds place, but since our book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can only be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 only for pages 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so the hundreds digit is never 8. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, adding that to our previous counts:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 48\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 48 + 89 = 186\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, so total 4's are 186, and total 8's are 98. So, 4's are more than 8's by 186 - 98 = 88. Hmm, that seems quite a lot more. But earlier, I didn't consider the hundreds place, so I think I was wrong before. The initial approach was only considering units and tens, but actually, the hundreds place also contributes a lot of 4's.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: each page from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 pages, each contributing one 4. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. So, that's a significant number.\n\nSo, going back, total 4's: units (49) + tens (48) + hundreds (89) = 186.\n\nTotal 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nSo, 4's are more than 8's by 186 - 98 = 88.\n\nWait, but that seems correct because the hundreds digit from 400-488 adds 89 4's, which is a lot more than any 8's.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't double-count any digits. For example, page 400 has 4 in hundreds, 0 in tens, 0 in units. So, that's one 4 in hundreds, no 4's in tens or units. Similarly, page 404 has 4 in hundreds and 4 in units, so that's two 4's. So, in the count, each digit is counted separately, so that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, page 488 has 4 in hundreds, 8 in tens, and 8 in units. So, that's one 4 and two 8's.\n\nSo, I think the correct counts are:\n\n4's: 186\n8's: 98\nDifference: 186 - 98 = 88\n\nSo, 4's are printed 88 more times than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer was 97 - 98 = -1, but that was before considering the hundreds place. So, the correct answer should be 88 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the counts again.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 49\nTens place for 4's: 48\nHundreds place for 4's: 89\nTotal: 49 + 48 + 89 = 186\n\nUnits place for 8's: 49\nTens place for 8's: 49\nHundreds place for 8's: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 186 - 98 = 88\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 88 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting '4's:**\n   - **Units Place:** In every block of 10 pages, '4' appears once. There are 48 full blocks (1-480) and one partial block (481-488). In the partial block, '4' appears once (at 484). Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** In every block of 100 pages, '4' appears 10 times in the tens place. For 1-400, there are 4 blocks, contributing 40 times. In 401-488, '4' appears 8 times in the tens place. Total: 40 + 8 = 48.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** Pages 400-488 have '4' in the hundreds place, totaling 89 times.\n\n   **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 186.\n\n2. **Counting '8's:**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to '4's, '8' appears once every 10 pages. For 1-480, 48 times, plus once in 488. Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** In every block of 100 pages, '8' appears 10 times. For 1-400, 4 blocks contribute 40 times. In 401-488, '8' appears 9 times (480-488). Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** '8' never appears in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n\n   **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 186\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 186 - 98 = 88\n\n**Answer:** There are 88 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n\\boxed{88}"

    "text": " Hmm, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should consider how page numbers are structured. Each page number is a number from 1 to 488, so we're dealing with one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers. The digits we're interested in are 4 and 8, so I need to count how many times each appears in all the page numbers.\n\nMaybe I should start by counting the number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract the two counts to find the difference. That makes sense.\n\nLet me think about how to count the number of times a specific digit appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once and 8 appears once in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place: For every 100 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), ..., up to 9 (90-99). So, in each block of 100, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSame logic applies to the hundreds place: For every 1000 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 100 times in the hundreds place. But since our book only has 488 pages, we'll only consider up to 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but 488 is less than 1000, so maybe I should adjust for that.\n\nLet me structure this.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's and 8's in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nWell, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488?\n\n488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n\nIn each group of 10, 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (484). So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place:\n\nSame approach. Every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once (488). So total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSo, so far, units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49. So, no difference here.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nHow many times does 4 appear in the tens place from 1 to 488?\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n\nWait, but our book goes up to 488, so the last set is 440-449, since 450-488 would be beyond that.\n\nWait, no, 440-449 is within 488, but 450-488 is a separate range.\n\nWait, actually, let's think about it differently.\n\nEach hundred has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. For example, in 1-100, it's 40-49; in 101-200, it's 140-149; in 201-300, it's 240-249; in 301-400, it's 340-349; and in 401-488, it's 440-449.\n\nWait, but 401-488 is part of the 400s, so the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers.\n\nSo, how many such sets are there?\n\nFrom 1-400, we have four sets: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349. Each of these is 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So that's 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40.\n\nThen, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers, so that's 10 more, making it 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So total 4's in the tens place: 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place.\n\nHow many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nAgain, each hundred has a set where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and in 401-488, it's 480-489, but since our book ends at 488, it's 480-488.\n\nSo, let's count:\n\n1-100: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers.\n\n101-200: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers.\n\n201-300: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers.\n\n301-400: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers.\n\n401-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page).\n\nSo, total 8's in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, so 4's in tens place: 50, 8's in tens place: 49.\n\nSo, so far, 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nHmm, so 4's are already ahead by 1.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place.\n\nHow many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place?\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400-488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4. So, how many numbers is that?\n\nFrom 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, how many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place?\n\nIn the hundreds place, 8 would appear from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nTherefore, adding this to our counts:\n\n4's: 99 (units and tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 98 (units and tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's printed is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n4's: 48 full decades (1-480), each contributing 1, so 48, plus 484 in 481-488, so 49.\n\n8's: Similarly, 48 full decades, plus 488, so 49.\n\nTens place:\n\n4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50.\n\n8's: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 5 sets, but the last one has only 9 numbers (480-488), so 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's: 400-488 \u2192 89 numbers.\n\n8's: 0.\n\nSo, 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the units and tens places were close, but the hundreds place adds a significant number of 4's.\n\nWait, let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nFor 8's, since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, the total 4's are 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I counted the tens place correctly for 4's. Let me recount that.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears in:\n\n40-49: 10 numbers.\n\n140-149: 10.\n\n240-249: 10.\n\n340-349: 10.\n\n440-449: 10.\n\nThat's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place:\n\n80-89: 10.\n\n180-189: 10.\n\n280-289: 10.\n\n380-389: 10.\n\n480-488: 9.\n\nTotal: 10\u00d74 +9=49. Correct.\n\nUnits place:\n\n4's: 48 full decades (1-480), each with one 4, so 48. Then 484 in 481-488, so 49.\n\n8's: 48 full decades, each with one 8, so 48. Then 488, so 49.\n\nSo, yes, units and tens both have 49 and 49 respectively for 4 and 8, but then the hundreds place adds 89 more 4's, making the total 4's much higher.\n\nSo, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the units place correctly. For example, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nIt's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484.\n\nSo, the first 4 is at 4, then every 10 after that.\n\nSo, the number of 4's in units place is floor((488 - 4)/10) +1.\n\nWait, let me compute that.\n\n(488 -4)=484.\n\n484 /10=48.4, so floor(48.4)=48.\n\nSo, 48 +1=49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: 8,18,28,...,488.\n\nNumber of terms: ((488 -8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nSo, units place counts are correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4's, as I did earlier, 5 sets of 10, so 50.\n\nFor 8's, 4 full sets of 10 and one partial set of 9, so 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's: 89.\n\n8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because 90 seems a bit high. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another approach: for each digit place, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFor 4: floor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10)=48 full cycles, each contributing 1, so 48. But since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so we add 1 more. So, 48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8: floor((488 +1)/10)=48. Then, since 488 mod10=8, which is exactly 8, so we add 1. So, 48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4: floor((488 +1)/100)=4 full cycles (1-400). Each cycle contributes 10 (e.g., 40-49). So, 4\u00d710=40. Then, check the remaining 88 numbers (401-488). How many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? From 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 40+10=50.\n\nFor 8: floor((488 +1)/100)=4 full cycles. Each contributes 10 (80-89, etc.), so 4\u00d710=40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor 4: floor((488 +1)/1000)=0 full cycles, but since 400-488 is within the range, the hundreds digit is 4 for 488-400+1=89 numbers.\n\nFor 8: floor((488 +1)/1000)=0, and since 800-899 is beyond 488, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, I think that's correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers is 188, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90. So, the final answer is \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488. Then, I need to do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering how digits are counted in numbers. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nI think I should handle each digit place one by one for both 4 and 8.\n\nLet me first count the number of 4's.\n\nStarting with the units place: In every set of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many such sets are there?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times, plus one more time in the 480s (484). Wait, actually, 484 is within 481-488, so that's an additional 1. So, total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49? Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, actually, for every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9, so the digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is within that, so that's one more 4. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. So, how many such blocks are there in 488?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these hundreds has a block where the tens digit is 4, so that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nWait, but wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10, making it 50? Wait, no, because 400-488 is part of the 400s, so the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, which is 10 numbers, and then from 410-488, the tens digit cycles through 1-8, so no more 4's in the tens place beyond that.\n\nWait, so in the hundreds place, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 400-409, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 more 4's in the tens place. So, total tens place 4's: 4 * 10 (from 1-400) plus 10 (from 400-409) = 50. Wait, but actually, 400-409 is part of the 400s, so maybe I should consider that as part of the hundreds place? Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the places.\n\nWait, no, the tens place is separate. So, in each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place exactly 10 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, from 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, but since 400-409 is within 401-488, that's 10 more 4's. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but actually, 400-409 is part of the 400s, so maybe I should consider that as part of the hundreds place. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcounting. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 would be in the 400s, right? So, from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nLet me list them:\n\n- 40-49: 10 times\n- 140-149: 10 times\n- 240-249: 10 times\n- 340-349: 10 times\n- 440-449: 10 times\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 5*10=50. So, total tens place 4's: 50.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is in the 400s, so is that correct? Because 400-488 includes 440-449, so yes, that's another 10. So, total 50.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but actually, each page number is a three-digit number, so from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's.\n\nNow, let's total up all the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check the units place again. Earlier, I thought it was 49, but let me verify.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which is another 4. So, 48 + 1 = 49. So, that's correct.\n\nTens place: 50, as above.\n\nHundreds place: 89, as above.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nSimilarly, I need to count how many times 8 appears in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place: same logic as 4's. In every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so that's one more 8 (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: Let's see. In each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, the digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n\nFrom 1-488, how many such blocks are there?\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, right? Because 488 is the last page.\n\nWait, so from 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but only for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89: yes, 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, 180-189: 10 8's.\n\n280-289: 10 8's.\n\n380-389: 10 8's.\n\n480-488: 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the 800s, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, the hundreds place digit is never 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, in the tens place, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8, and there are 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's 9 times, correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, for 4's, I had 188, and for 8's, 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nTens place: 50.\n\nHundreds place: 89.\n\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nTens place: 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal: 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place, 4's: 50, as we have 5 blocks where the tens digit is 4, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50.\n\nUnits place: 49, as calculated.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, units and tens each have 49, so 98 total.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, it's easy to miss a boundary case.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe using a formula for counting digits.\n\nThe formula for counting the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to N can be calculated by considering each digit place separately.\n\nLet me try applying that to both 4 and 8.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\nLet me break down 488 into its digits: 4 (hundreds), 8 (tens), 8 (units).\n\nWe'll calculate the number of 4's in each place.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\n- Higher digits: 48 (the number formed by digits higher than units, so 48 in this case).\n- Current digit: 8.\n- Lower digits: 8 (the number formed by digits lower than units, which is 0 in this case, but wait, maybe I'm mixing up the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use a standard digit counting method.\n\nThe standard method is to split the number into higher, current, and lower parts.\n\nFor each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), we can compute the number of times a digit appears.\n\nLet me try for 4's in each place.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- Higher digits: 48 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so higher digits are 48).\n- Current digit: 8 (units place).\n- Lower digits: 0 (since we're in units place).\n\nThe formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the units place is:\n\ncount = higher * 10^0 + if current > d, then 1 else 0.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I'm applying this correctly.\n\nAlternatively, for units place, the number of 4's is equal to higher digits * 1 (since every 10 numbers contribute one 4) plus, if the current digit is greater than or equal to 4, then add the lower digits + 1, else add 0.\n\nWait, maybe that's more accurate.\n\nSo, for units place:\n\nhigher = 48 (since 488 // 10 = 48)\n\ncurrent = 8 (units digit)\n\nlower = 0 (since we're at the units place, there are no lower digits)\n\nWe're looking for digit d=4.\n\nSo, count_units = higher * 1 + (if current >= d, then (lower + 1) else 0)\n\nSo, count_units = 48 * 1 + (if 8 >= 4, then 0 + 1 else 0) = 48 + 1 = 49. That matches what I had earlier.\n\nTens place:\n\nhigher = 488 // 100 = 4\n\ncurrent = 8 (tens digit)\n\nlower = 8 (units digit)\n\ncount_tens = higher * 10 + (if current >= 4, then (lower + 1) else 0)\n\nWait, no, the formula for tens place is a bit different.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\ncount_tens = higher * 10 + (if current > d, then 10 else (current - d) * 10) + 1 if current == d and lower >=0 else 0.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, the number of times digit d appears in the tens place is calculated as:\n\ncount = (higher) * 10 + extra, where extra depends on current and lower.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use the standard approach.\n\nFor the tens place, the number of times 4 appears is:\n\n- For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, 10 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nSo, from 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, which is 10 numbers, so that's another 10.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWhich matches my earlier count.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds place:\n\nThe hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\nUnits place:\n\nhigher = 488 // 10 = 48\n\ncurrent = 8\n\nlower = 0\n\ncount_units = higher * 1 + (if current >= 8, then (lower + 1) else 0) = 48 * 1 + (8 >= 8 ? 0 + 1 : 0) = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nhigher = 488 // 100 = 4\n\ncurrent = 8\n\nlower = 8\n\ncount_tens = higher * 10 + (if current > 8, then 10 else (current - 8) * 10) + 1 if current == 8 and lower >=0 else 0.\n\nWait, that seems a bit confusing. Alternatively, using the approach where in each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers.\n\nSo, in each hundred, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n\nFrom 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so that's 9 more.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nThe hundreds digit is 8 only in 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nI think that's the answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, etc., totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear, as pages go up to 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488, and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. Hmm, that seems logical.\n\nLet me start by considering how digits are structured in page numbers. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488, which is a three-digit number. So, I'll need to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nI think the best approach is to calculate the number of times each digit (4 and 8) appears in each place (units, tens, hundreds) and then sum them up.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - In the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there?\n   - 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10, and then 8 extra numbers.\n   - In each group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.).\n   - So, 48 groups \u00d7 1 = 48 times.\n   - Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once here as well (484).\n   - So, total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of 10 numbers every 100. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - How many such blocks are there up to 488?\n   - The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks in total.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place.\n   - So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n   - But wait, let me check if 440-449 is fully within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488, so all 10 numbers are included. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive?\n   - 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.\n   - So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the occurrences of 4:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units place: 48 groups of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Then in the last partial group, 481-488, the units digit is 4 once, so 48 + 1 = 49. That seems right.\n\nTens place: 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10, so 50. That's correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, 89. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, in the units place, 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total groups of 10: 48 complete groups, each contributing 1, so 48.\n   - Remaining 8 numbers: 481-488. The units digits here go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (488).\n   - So, total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In the tens place, 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.\n   - Wait, up to 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them.\n   - So, how many such blocks are there?\n   - 80-89: 10 numbers\n   - 180-189: 10\n   - 280-289: 10\n   - 380-389: 10\n   - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n   - So, that's 4 full blocks (each contributing 10) and 1 partial block contributing 9.\n   - So, total in tens place: (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So yes, 4\u00d710=40 plus 9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is from 800 to 899. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8.\n   - So, the digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the occurrences of 8:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4\u00d710 + 9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, total 8's:98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me confirm my calculations again because sometimes I might have made a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me go through each step again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full groups of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, 484 is the only one with units digit 4. So, 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d710=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full groups of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in 481-488, 488 has units digit 8, so 1 more. Total 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4\u00d710=40 +9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, since we don't reach 800. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that I missed any numbers? For example, in the hundreds place for 4's, 400-488 is correct, but what about 488 itself? Wait, 488 is included in the hundreds place count because the hundreds digit is 4. So, yes, it's counted in the 89 numbers.\n\nWait, but when counting the tens place for 8's, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 times 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, another thought: when counting the units place for 8's, the last page is 488, which is included, so the units digit 8 appears once there. So, that's correct.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly for 4's. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1=89 numbers. So, yes, 89 times 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times 8 in the tens place.\n\nI think that's all. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full groups of 10 (48 \u00d7 1) + 1 in the last partial group = 49.\n- **Tens place:** 5 blocks of 10 (5 \u00d7 10) = 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 numbers (400-488) = 89.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full groups of 10 (48 \u00d7 1) + 1 in the last partial group = 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 blocks of 10 (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 in the last partial block = 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 (since pages don't reach 800).\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. Hmm, maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the digit 4, let me think about how often it appears in each place.\n\n1. **Units place**: The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups and then 8 extra numbers. So in each group of 10, 4 appears once in the units place. That would be 48 times. Plus, in the last partial group from 481 to 488, the units digit 4 appears once (at 484). So total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place**: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, etc. So how many such groups are there up to 488? Let's see, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds. Each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10 = 40. But wait, in the last partial hundred (300-488), the tens digit 4 appears from 400-409, which is 10 numbers, so that's another 10. Wait, no, 400-488 is part of the 400s, so the tens digit 4 would be from 400-409, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 more. So total tens place 4's would be 4*10 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is only up to 488, so from 400-488, the tens digit 4 is only in 400-409, right? So that's 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place. So adding to the previous 4*10=40, total would be 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So total 4's printed are 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place**: The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus, in the last partial group, from 481-488, the units digit 8 appears at 488. So that's 1 more. So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place**: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers. So from 80-89, 180-189, etc. How many such groups are there up to 488? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds. Each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (300-488), the tens digit 8 is from 380-389, which is 10 numbers, so that's another 10. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but 380-389 is within 300-488, right? So that's correct, 10 more. So total 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So the hundreds digit is never 8. So hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 50 = 99.\n\nWait, so total 4's are 188 and 8's are 99. So the difference is 188 - 99 = 89. Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, when counting the 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's. That seems right.\n\nFor the 4's in the tens place, I had 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40, and then from 400-488, the tens digit 4 is from 400-409, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more, totaling 50. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48, plus 484, which is in the last partial group, so 1 more, total 49. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's, units place: 48 full groups, 48, plus 488, so 1 more, total 49. Tens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40, plus 380-389, which is 10 more, total 50. Hundreds place: 0. So total 8's: 49 + 50 = 99.\n\nSo 4's: 188, 8's: 99. Difference is 188 - 99 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes when counting, especially in the hundreds place, I might have missed something.\n\nWait, for the 4's in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems right.\n\nFor the 8's, in the hundreds place, since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s, so 0 8's in the hundreds place. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but when counting the 8's in the tens place, I considered 380-389 as part of the 300-488 range. But 380-389 is within 300-488, so that's correct, 10 numbers. So 40 from the four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, etc.) plus 10 from 380-389, totaling 50.\n\nSimilarly, for the 4's in the tens place, from 400-409, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place in that range. Plus the four full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40, totaling 50.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 99, so the difference is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups of 10, contributing 48 times. Additionally, in the range 481-488, 484 contributes one more. Total: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers every 100. From 1-400, there are 4 sets (40-49, 140-149, etc.), contributing 40 times. From 400-488, 400-409 adds another 10. Total: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Total: 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, 48 groups contribute 48 times, plus 488 adds one more. Total: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers every 100. From 1-400, 4 sets contribute 40 times. From 300-488, 380-389 adds another 10. Total: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers are in the 800s, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 99.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 99 (8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 89.\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{89}."

    "text": " Hmm, let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should break down the problem. The question is about counting the number of times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers versus the digit 8. Then, I need to find the difference between these two counts. So, maybe I should start by calculating how many 4's are there in total and then do the same for 8's, and subtract the two results.\n\nI remember that when counting digits in numbers, it's often helpful to consider each digit place separately\u2014like units, tens, hundreds, etc. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers are three-digit numbers at most, right? But wait, actually, from 1 to 9, they are single-digit, from 10 to 99, two-digit, and from 100 to 488, three-digit. So, maybe I should handle each of these ranges separately.\n\nLet me try to structure this:\n\n1. Count the number of 4's in each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) from 1 to 488.\n2. Do the same for 8's.\n3. Subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to get the difference.\n\nAlright, let's start with counting the 4's.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\nI'll break this down into units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\n- **Units place:**\n  - In the units place, 4 appears once every 10 numbers. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484.\n  - How many such numbers are there up to 488?\n  - Well, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48 full groups of 10, and then 8 remaining numbers.\n  - So, in each group of 10, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, 48 groups give 48 fours. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (484). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, hold on, let me check that again. If I take 488 divided by 10, that's 48.8, so 48 full tens, and 0.8 of a ten, which is 8 numbers. So yes, 48 times 1, plus 1 more in the last 8, so 49. That seems right.\n\n- **Tens place:**\n  - In the tens place, 4 appears in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n  - Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4.\n  - How many such blocks are there up to 488?\n  - Let's see: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours.\n\nWait, but hold on, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440 is the 440th page, which is within 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 5 blocks, each with 10 fours, so 50.\n\n- **Hundreds place:**\n  - In the hundreds place, 4 appears from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that?\n  - From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. From 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers? 488 - 400 = 88, so adding 1 gives 89 numbers. So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me make sure I didn't double-count or miss something. Units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, okay, maybe that's correct.\n\n**Now, counting the number of 8's:**\n\nI'll do the same approach, breaking it down into units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n- **Units place:**\n  - Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488.\n  - From 1 to 488, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups of 10, and 8 remaining numbers.\n  - So, 48 eights from the units place. Now, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1-8, so 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that seems similar to the 4's. So, units place 8's: 49.\n\n- **Tens place:**\n  - In the tens place, 8 appears in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers, right?\n  - Let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers.\n  - So, the first four blocks contribute 10 eights each, and the last block contributes 9 eights in the tens place.\n  - So, total tens place 8's: 4 * 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me think again. Each block from 80-89, etc., has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-489 would be the next, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 9 numbers (480-488). So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\n- **Hundreds place:**\n  - In the hundreds place, 8 would appear from page 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no hundreds digits of 8 in the page numbers. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, so total 8's are 98, and total 4's are 188. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because I feel like maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, when I calculated the 4's in the hundreds place, I considered from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there.\n\nFor the 8's in the tens place, I had 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, totaling 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nUnits place for 8's: same as for 4's, 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. That seems correct.\n\nFor the tens place of 4's: from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 5 blocks of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 49, as calculated.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nTens place: 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal: 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, seems correct. But let me think if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nWait, another approach: For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate how many times 4 appears and how many times 8 appears, then sum them up.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- For 4 in units place: As before, every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, and then in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit is 8, so 4 appears once more. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- For 8 in units place: Similarly, every 10 numbers, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, and in the remaining 8 numbers, 8 appears once (488). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For 4 in tens place: Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-488, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought of it as 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, etc., but that might be the same as 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers. Wait, but 40-49 is in the first hundred, 140-149 in the second, 240-249 in the third, 340-349 in the fourth, and 440-449 in the fifth, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours in the tens place.\n\n- For 8 in tens place: Similarly, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-488, how many such blocks?\n\nFirst block: 80-89 (10 numbers), second: 180-189 (10), third: 280-289 (10), fourth: 380-389 (10), fifth: 480-488 (9 numbers, since 480-488 is 9 numbers). So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- For 4 in hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\n- For 8 in hundreds place: From 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 188.\n\n8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me try another approach, maybe by using a formula or a more systematic way.\n\nI remember that the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n can be calculated as follows:\n\n- Let q = n // 10, r = n % 10.\n- If d < r, then count = q * 10 + d + 1.\n- If d == r, count = (q + 1) * 10.\n- If d > r, count = q * 10.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm mixing up the formula. Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of each digit place separately.\n\nAlternatively, for each digit place, the number of times a digit appears can be calculated by considering higher digits, current digit, and lower digits.\n\nBut maybe that's more complicated. Let me try to apply it for units place.\n\nFor units place:\n\n- For digit 4:\n  - Number of times 4 appears in units place from 1 to 488.\n  - The formula is: higher = 48, current = 8, lower = 8.\n  - Wait, no, perhaps I should think of n as 488.\n\nWait, maybe I should use a standard digit counting method.\n\nThe standard approach is to consider each digit position separately and compute the number of times a digit appears in that position.\n\nFor a given position (units, tens, hundreds), the count can be calculated by:\n\n1. Split the number into higher part, current digit, and lower part.\n2. For each digit d (0-9), the count is determined based on the higher part, current digit, and lower part.\n\nBut since I'm dealing with digits 4 and 8, I need to adjust for those specific digits.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use this method for both 4 and 8 in each digit place.\n\nLet me try this for the units place.\n\n**Units place for 4:**\n\nn = 488.\n\nWe want to count how many times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488.\n\n- The formula is:\n  - higher = n // 10 = 488 // 10 = 48.\n  - current = (n // 1) % 10 = 8.\n  - lower = n % 10 = 8.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me look up the standard digit counting formula.\n\nWait, the standard formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is:\n\ncount = (n // 10) * 1 + (1 if d <= (n % 10) else 0).\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, for the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once every 10 numbers. So, up to n, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place is:\n\ncount = (n // 10) * 1 + (1 if d <= (n % 10) else 0).\n\nWait, but for d=0, it's a bit different because 0 doesn't appear in the units place for numbers like 10, 20, etc. But in our case, we're considering digits 4 and 8, which are non-zero.\n\nSo, applying this formula:\n\nFor d=4:\n\ncount_units_4 = (488 // 10) * 1 + (1 if 4 <= (488 % 10) else 0).\n\n488 // 10 = 48, 488 % 10 = 8.\n\nSince 4 <= 8, we add 1.\n\nSo, count_units_4 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8:\n\ncount_units_8 = (488 // 10) * 1 + (1 if 8 <= (488 % 10) else 0).\n\n488 % 10 = 8, so 8 <= 8, so we add 1.\n\ncount_units_8 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation.\n\n**Tens place for 4:**\n\nNow, for the tens place, the formula is a bit more involved.\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to n can be calculated as:\n\ncount = (higher) * 10 + (if current > d: 10 else if current == d: lower + 1 else 0).\n\nWait, let me try to apply this.\n\nFor d=4:\n\nn = 488.\n\nWe can split n into higher, current, and lower parts for the tens place.\n\n- higher = n // 100 = 488 // 100 = 4.\n- current = (n // 10) % 10 = (488 // 10) % 10 = 48 % 10 = 8.\n- lower = n % 10 = 8.\n\nSo, applying the formula:\n\nIf current > d: count += (higher + 1) * 10.\nIf current == d: count += higher * 10 + (lower + 1).\nIf current < d: count += higher * 10.\n\nHere, d=4, current=8.\n\nSince current (8) > d (4), we add (higher + 1) * 10.\n\nhigher is 4, so (4 + 1) * 10 = 5 * 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because from 1 to 488, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10), which is 5 blocks of 10, so 50 times. So, that matches.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8 in the tens place:\n\nn=488.\n\nhigher = 488 // 100 = 4.\ncurrent = (488 // 10) % 10 = 48 % 10 = 8.\nlower = 488 % 10 = 8.\n\nSince current == d (8), we add higher * 10 + (lower + 1).\n\nhigher is 4, so 4 * 10 = 40, plus lower +1 = 8 +1=9. So, 40 + 9=49.\n\nWhich again matches our earlier count.\n\n**Hundreds place for 4:**\n\nFor the hundreds place, d=4.\n\nn=488.\n\nhigher = n // 1000 = 0.\ncurrent = (n // 100) % 10 = 4.\nlower = n % 100 = 88.\n\nSince current == d, the count is higher * 100 + (lower + 1).\n\nhigher is 0, so 0 * 100 = 0, plus lower +1=88+1=89.\n\nSo, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nFor d=8 in hundreds place:\n\ncurrent = (488 // 100) % 10 = 4, which is less than 8, so the count is higher * 100 + 0, since current < d.\n\nhigher is 0, so 0 * 100 = 0.\n\nThus, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, summing up:\n\n4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 188.\n\n8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, I think that's correct. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we need to count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n### Counting the number of 4's:\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 4 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of 10, contributing 48 fours.\n   - In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 4 appears once (484).\n   - Total units place 4's: \\(48 + 1 = 49\\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 fours, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total tens place 4's: \\(5 \\times 10 = 50\\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears from page 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - Total hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\nTotal number of 4's: \\(49 + 50 + 89 = 188\\).\n\n### Counting the number of 8's:\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of 10, contributing 48 eights.\n   - In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total units place 8's: \\(48 + 1 = 49\\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 eights each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 eights.\n   - Total tens place 8's: \\(4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49\\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nTotal number of 8's: \\(49 + 49 + 0 = 98\\).\n\n### Difference:\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\(188 - 98 = 90\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{90}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that each page number is printed once, starting from 1 and going up to 488. So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears, then subtract the two to find the difference.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to consider each digit place separately: the units place and the tens place. Maybe even the hundreds place if necessary, but since the book is 488 pages, the hundreds digit only goes up to 4, right? So, maybe I should check all three places.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times a specific digit (like 4 or 8) appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then seeing how many complete sets of 10 there are, and then adding any extra pages beyond that.\n\nWait, but maybe a better approach is to calculate how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nLet me structure this:\n\n1. Count the number of 4's in the units place.\n2. Count the number of 4's in the tens place.\n3. Count the number of 4's in the hundreds place.\n4. Do the same for the digit 8.\n5. Subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Let's start with the units place for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's in the units place:**\n\nEach block of 10 pages (like 1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490) has exactly one 4 in the units place. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 481-488, which is only 8 pages. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there?\n\nTotal pages: 488.\n\nNumber of complete blocks of 10: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That's 48 times.\n\nBut wait, the last block is incomplete, from 481 to 488. Let's see if there's a 4 in the units place here. 484 would be the number where the units digit is 4. So, that's one more 4 in the units place.\n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me think again.\n\nActually, for each complete block of 10 pages, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each block, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. The number of complete blocks is floor(488 / 10) = 48 blocks. So, 48 times 1 is 48. Now, the remaining pages after 480 are 481 to 488, which is 8 pages. So, in these 8 pages, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, the digit 4 appears once in the units place here as well (484). So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place:\n\nEach complete block of 10 has one 8 in the units place. So, 48 blocks give 48 eights. The remaining pages 481-488 have units digits 1-8, so 488 is the last page, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more 8. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, so both 4 and 8 have 49 occurrences in the units place. That means in the units place, they are equal. So, the difference comes from the tens and hundreds places.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\n**Counting 4's in the tens place:**\n\nThe tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, in the range 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, in 140-149, 240-249, etc.\n\nSo, how many times does the digit 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nEach hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). Now, the book has 488 pages, so we have four hundreds: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nIn each of the first three hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit 4 appears exactly 10 times each. So that's 3 * 10 = 30.\n\nNow, in the last hundred, 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 400-488? Yes, 440 is within that range, and 449 is as well. So, that's another 10 occurrences.\n\nWait, but 400-488 includes 400 to 488, so 400-488 is 89 pages. The tens digit cycles every 10 pages. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, that's 10 more.\n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place: 30 (from first three hundreds) + 10 = 40.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 400-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, yes, 10 occurrences. So, total 4's in tens place: 3*10 + 10 = 40.\n\n**Counting 8's in the tens place:**\n\nSimilarly, the digit 8 in the tens place appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488, which is 9 pages.\n\nSo, let's break it down:\n\nEach hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) has a block where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, 3 hundreds * 10 = 30.\n\nNow, in the last hundred, 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. That's 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 in all these 9 pages.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the tens digit in 480-488 is 8 for all of them because 480 is 4-8-0, 481 is 4-8-1, up to 488, which is 4-8-8. So, yes, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 pages.\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place: 30 (from first three hundreds) + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but wait a second. In the hundreds place, the digit 8 doesn't appear because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400-488. So, the hundreds digit 8 doesn't occur at all. So, we don't need to consider that for 8's. But for 4's, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, so that's another place to check.\n\nWait, but I was only considering the tens place so far. Let me make sure I'm not mixing up.\n\nSo, for the tens place, 8's occur 30 times in the first three hundreds and 9 times in the last hundred, so total 39.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: in 400-488, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, yes, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 8's in tens place: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, for 4's in tens place: 40, and 8's in tens place: 39. So, 4's have one more in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\n**Counting 4's in the hundreds place:**\n\nThe hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400 to 488. So, how many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\n**Counting 8's in the hundreds place:**\n\nSince the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89, and 8's: 0.\n\nNow, let me sum up all the occurrences:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 40\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 40 + 89 = let's calculate that. 49 + 40 is 89, plus 89 is 178.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 39\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 39 = 88.\n\nWait, that seems off because 49 + 39 is 88, but 4's are 178. So, the difference is 178 - 88 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big difference.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the units place. Let me go back.\n\nWait, earlier, I thought that in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. Let me check that again.\n\nTotal pages: 488.\n\nNumber of complete blocks of 10: 48 blocks, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 each.\n\nThen, the remaining pages are 481-488, which is 8 pages. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, 4's: 40, 8's: 39. So, 4's have one more there.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4's: 89, 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 40 + 89 = 178.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 39 + 0 = 88.\n\nDifference: 178 - 88 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but I'm a bit surprised. Let me check each step again.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in units place: 48 each.\n\n- Remaining 8 pages: 481-488. Units digits: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484), 8 appears once (488). So, total 49 each.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For 4's: Each hundred has 10 occurrences in the tens place. There are 4 hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488.\n\nWait, actually, 0-99 is the first hundred, but page numbers start at 1, so pages 1-99. So, in 0-99, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, which is 10 pages. Similarly, in 100-199, 140-149, and so on. So, in each hundred, 10 occurrences.\n\nBut wait, the book goes up to 488, so the last hundred is 400-488. So, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, total 4's in tens place: 4 hundreds? Wait, no, the hundreds are 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, that's five hundreds, but the first one (0-99) is 100 pages, and the last one (400-488) is 89 pages.\n\nWait, no, actually, page numbers start at 1, so the first hundred is 1-100, but page 100 is included. So, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how many full hundreds and the last partial hundred.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.\n\nIn the tens place, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place, except possibly in the last hundred if it's incomplete.\n\nSo, from 1-100, 10 times.\n\nFrom 101-200, another 10 times.\n\nFrom 201-300, another 10 times.\n\nFrom 301-400, another 10 times.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times.\n\nWait, but 401-488 is 88 pages. So, 440-449 is within that range, so 10 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 3 hundreds, but that's incorrect. It's actually 4 hundreds where the tens digit 4 appears 10 times each, and the last partial hundred (400-488) also includes 440-449, which is another 10. Wait, no, that's overlapping.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me clarify.\n\nThe hundreds are:\n\n1-100: in the tens place, 40-49: 10 times.\n\n101-200: 140-149: 10 times.\n\n201-300: 240-249: 10 times.\n\n301-400: 340-349: 10 times.\n\n401-488: 440-449: 10 times.\n\nWait, but 401-488 is the fifth hundred? No, 401-488 is part of the 400-499 range, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488.\n\nWait, so in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, that's another 10.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) each contribute 10, so 4*10=40, plus 10 from 440-449, totaling 50.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 40. Hmm, now I'm confused.\n\nWait, no, because 400-488 is part of the 400-499 range, but the hundreds digit is 4, and the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, that's an additional 10, making it 50.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 40. So, perhaps I was wrong before.\n\nWait, let me list them:\n\n1-100: 40-49: 10.\n\n101-200: 140-149: 10.\n\n201-300: 240-249: 10.\n\n301-400: 340-349: 10.\n\n401-488: 440-449: 10.\n\nSo, that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is within the 400-499 range, so 440-449 is within that. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 50.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 40. So, I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me check for 8's in the tens place.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place:\n\n1-100: 80-89: 10.\n\n101-200: 180-189: 10.\n\n201-300: 280-289: 10.\n\n301-400: 380-389: 10.\n\n401-488: 480-488: 9.\n\nSo, total 8's in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, so 4's in tens place: 50, 8's: 49.\n\nSo, the difference is 50 - 49 = 1.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place.\n\n4's in hundreds place: pages 400-488: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n8's in hundreds place: 0, since the book doesn't reach 800.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nTotal 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's in tens place were 40, but now I'm getting 50. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial count. Let me try a different approach.\n\nAnother way to count the number of times a digit appears in a certain position is to consider each digit place separately.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is given by:\n\nfloor(N / 10) * 1 + min(max(N % 10 - d + 1, 0), 1)\n\nWait, maybe that's too formulaic, but perhaps I can use a formula.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, it's more complex, but perhaps I can think in terms of higher digits.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position up to 488.\n\nLet me try to calculate 4's and 8's in each position.\n\n**Units place:**\n\nAs before, each digit from 0-9 appears equally in the units place, except possibly the last partial block.\n\nTotal pages: 488.\n\nNumber of complete blocks of 10: 48, each contributing one 4 and one 8.\n\nRemaining pages: 488 - 48*10 = 8 pages: 481-488.\n\nIn these, units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nSo, 4 appears once, 8 appears once.\n\nTotal 4's in units: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTotal 8's in units: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n**Tens place:**\n\nFor the tens digit, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each hundred.\n\nSo, for each hundred, the digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nFrom 1-100: 10 times for each digit in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, 101-200: another 10 times.\n\nSo, up to 400, each digit has appeared 40 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8.\n\nSo, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488).\n\nSo, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear?\n\n- 0: 401-410: 10 pages (but 410 is included, so 10 pages)\n- 1: 411-420: 10 pages\n- 2: 421-430: 10 pages\n- 3: 431-440: 10 pages\n- 4: 441-450: 10 pages\n- 5: 451-460: 10 pages\n- 6: 461-470: 10 pages\n- 7: 471-480: 10 pages\n- 8: 481-488: 8 pages\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 pages: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them.\n\nWait, but 480 is part of the 480-488 range, so the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 pages.\n\nSo, for the tens digit 4 in 401-488: 441-450, which is 10 pages.\n\nSo, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and the tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place:\n\nUp to 400: 40 times.\n\nPlus 10 in 401-488: total 50.\n\nSimilarly, total 8's in tens place:\n\nUp to 400: 40 times.\n\nPlus 9 in 401-488: total 49.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my earlier correction.\n\n**Hundreds place:**\n\nFor the hundreds digit, from 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (if we consider it as three-digit numbers), but since page numbers start at 1, it's more accurate to say that pages 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit. Pages 100-199 have hundreds digit 1, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n\nSo, 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\n8's in hundreds place: 0, since the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I'm counting the hundreds place correctly. Because pages 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit, so the hundreds digit is only present from 100 onwards.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times.\n\nThe digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book doesn't reach 800.\n\nSo, that part seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in the tens place, 4's appeared 50 times and 8's 49 times, so 4's have one more in the tens place. Then, in the hundreds place, 4's have 89 more, and 8's have none.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, 4's are printed 90 times more than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check again because this seems like a lot. Maybe I'm overcounting.\n\nWait, for example, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. In the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times. In the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, 4's total: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's total: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because 4's in the hundreds place alone are 89, which is a big number, but since the book goes up to 488, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, and hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total complete blocks of 10: 48, contributing 48 occurrences each for 4 and 8.\n   - Remaining pages (481-488): 484 (one 4) and 488 (one 8).\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times per hundred.\n   - For 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449 (10 each) \u2192 50 occurrences.\n   - For 8's: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488 (9 occurrences) \u2192 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4's appear in pages 400-488: 89 occurrences.\n   - 8's do not appear in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem clearly. Each page is numbered from 1 to 488, and each number is printed once. I have to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Then, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nHmm, maybe I should break this down by the digits' places: units, tens, hundreds, etc. Because the number of times a digit appears can depend on its position in the number. For example, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often, but maybe not exactly because the total number of pages is 488, which isn't a multiple of 10, 100, etc.\n\nWait, actually, 488 is a three-digit number, so I should consider units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\nLet me start by calculating the number of times the digit 4 appears in each place.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So from page 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra pages. In each group of 10, the units digit is 4 once. So that's 48 times. But wait, in the last 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more in the units place (page 484). So total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 1 to 480, that's 48 groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So yes, 484 has a 4 in the units place, so that's one more. So total units 4's: 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for a block of 100 pages. For example, from 40 to 49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 pages. Similarly, from 140 to 149, and so on.\n\nSo how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nFirst, let's see how many hundreds are there in 488. The hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4 because 488 is in the 400s.\n\nFor the tens place, each time the tens digit is 4, it's a block of 10 pages. So in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages. So for each hundred, that's 10 times.\n\nNow, how many hundreds are there where the tens digit can be 4?\n\nFrom 0 to 488, the hundreds digits go from 0 (pages 1-99) up to 4 (pages 400-488).\n\nSo for each hundred, except maybe the last one, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times.\n\nWait, but for the hundreds beyond 4, like 500 and above, but since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digits go up to 4.\n\nWait, let's break it down:\n\n- Pages 1-99: The tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 pages. So that's 10 times.\n- Pages 100-199: The tens digit is 4 in 140-149, another 10 times.\n- Pages 200-299: The tens digit is 4 in 240-249, another 10 times.\n- Pages 300-399: The tens digit is 4 in 340-349, another 10 times.\n- Pages 400-488: The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is 10 pages, but does 449 exist? Since the book ends at 488, yes, 449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10 times.\n\nSo that's 5 sets of 10, so 5*10 = 50 times.\n\nWait, but pages 400-488: The tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so yes, 10 times. So total tens place 4's: 50.\n\nWait, but let me check if 400-488 includes 440-449. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So 50 times.\n\nNow, what about the hundreds place? The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488. How many times does the hundreds digit 4 appear?\n\nFrom 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 pages. So that's 89 times.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89.\n\nLet me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, then 99 + 89 = 188. So 4's appear 188 times.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 pages, 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more (page 488). So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 1-480, that's 48 groups of 10, each with one 8 in the units place, so 48. Then 481-488 includes 488, which is an 8 in the units place, so yes, 49 total.\n\nNow, tens place for 8: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for a block of 10 pages, such as 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n\nHow many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nAgain, considering each hundred:\n\n- Pages 1-99: Tens digit 8 is in 80-89, which is 10 pages.\n- Pages 100-199: Tens digit 8 is in 180-189, another 10.\n- Pages 200-299: Tens digit 8 is in 280-289, another 10.\n- Pages 300-399: Tens digit 8 is in 380-389, another 10.\n- Pages 400-488: Tens digit 8 is in 480-489, but wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 pages (since 488 - 480 +1 = 9). So instead of 10, it's 9 times.\n\nSo total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\n- 1-99: 10\n- 100-199: 10\n- 200-299: 10\n- 300-399: 10\n- 400-488: 9 (since 480-488 is 9 pages)\nSo 10*4 + 9 = 49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, hundreds place for 8: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, so 4's are 188 times, 8's are 98 times. So the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. Because in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 pages. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again: For the tens place, in each hundred, except the last one, 8 appears 10 times, but in the last hundred (400-488), it's only 9 times because the book ends at 488. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 4's in the tens place, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so that's fine.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I think about the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times. So that seems correct.\n\nLet me add up the 4's again: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nAnd 8's: units (49) + tens (49) = 98.\n\nSo the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because I thought maybe I missed something in the units place. Let me check the units place for 4's again.\n\nFrom 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 pages, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial group, pages 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once more at 484. So total 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, units place: 48 full groups, 48, and then 488, so 49.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about another approach. Maybe using a formula or a more systematic way.\n\nFor any digit in any place, the number of times it appears can be calculated by considering higher digits, current digit, and lower digits.\n\nBut maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, I can think in terms of each digit place separately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for digit frequency.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to just go through each place again to make sure.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nUnits place:\n\nTotal numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in units place: floor(488 / 10) = 48, plus if the last digit is >=4, which it is, since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so add 1. So 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in tens place: floor(488 / 100) = 4, since 488 /100=4.88, so 4 full hundreds. Then, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9, so in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So 4*10=40.\n\nBut wait, in the last hundred (400-488), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? From 440-449, that's 10 pages, so that's 10. So total tens place 4's: 4*10 +10=50.\n\nWait, but in the formula, it's usually calculated as:\n\nFor the tens place, the number of times a digit d appears is:\n\nhigher = number formed by digits higher than current place\n\ncurrent = current digit\n\nlower = number formed by digits lower than current place\n\nSo for the tens place in 488:\n\nThe number is 488. The tens place is 8, but we're looking for digit 4.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, the number of times 4 appears in the tens place is:\n\nFor each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9. So in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. From 0-488, there are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 pages, but the tens digit still cycles through 0-9 in each ten pages.\n\nWait, so in 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So when does 4 appear? In 440-449, which is 10 pages. So that's 10 times.\n\nSo total tens place 4's: 5 hundreds, each contributing 10 times, but wait, no, because 400-488 is only 89 pages, but the tens digit still goes through 0-9 for each ten pages. So from 400-409: tens digit 0, 410-419: 1, ..., 440-449:4, etc., up to 480-488:8. So in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears exactly once in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So total tens place 4's: 5 hundreds, each with 10 times, but wait, actually, the hundreds are 0-4, but the last hundred (400-488) is incomplete. Wait, no, the hundreds are 0-99, 100-199, etc., up to 400-488.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as:\n\nNumber of full hundreds before 400: 4 (0-399). Each of these contributes 10 times in the tens place for digit 4. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 appears once more in 440-449, which is 10 times. So total tens place 4's: 4*10 +10=50.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSimilarly, for the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\nUnits place: 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, since the last digit is 8, which is >=8, so add 1. So 48+1=49.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times, except in the last hundred (400-488), where it appears only 9 times because the book ends at 488, not 489.\n\nSo how many hundreds are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So 5 hundreds.\n\nIn each of the first four hundreds, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. In the last hundred, 400-488, it's 9 times.\n\nSo total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 8 appears in 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 0 times.\n\nSo total 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me check again.\n\nWait, another way: For each digit place, calculate 4's and 8's.\n\nUnits place:\n\n4's: floor(488/10)=48, plus if last digit >=4, which it is (8>=4), so 48+1=49.\n\n8's: floor(488/10)=48, plus if last digit >=8, which it is (8=8), so 48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\n4's: For each hundred, 10 times. Number of hundreds is 5 (0-4), but in the last hundred (400-488), how many times does 4 appear in tens place? From 440-449, which is 10 pages. So 5 hundreds, each contributing 10 times: 5*10=50.\n\n8's: For each hundred, 10 times, except the last hundred where it's 9 times. So 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's: From 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\n8's: 0 times.\n\nSo total 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nSo the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** \n     - Every 10 pages, 4 appears once in the units place. \n     - Total groups of 10: 48 (from 1-480), contributing 48 times.\n     - Pages 481-488 include 484, adding 1 more.\n     - **Total Units Place 4's:** 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** \n     - In each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n     - From 0-399: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times \u2192 40.\n     - From 400-488: 440-449 contributes 10 times.\n     - **Total Tens Place 4's:** 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** \n     - Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place: 89 pages.\n     - **Total Hundreds Place 4's:** 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** \n     - Similar to 4, 8 appears once every 10 pages.\n     - Total groups of 10: 48, contributing 48 times.\n     - Pages 481-488 include 488, adding 1 more.\n     - **Total Units Place 8's:** 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** \n     - In each hundred, 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n     - From 0-399: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times \u2192 40.\n     - From 400-488: 480-488 contributes 9 times.\n     - **Total Tens Place 8's:** 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** \n     - Pages 800-899 are beyond 488, so no occurrences.\n     - **Total Hundreds Place 8's:** 0.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe digit 4 is printed 90 times more than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488, and then do the same for the digit 8. Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. Hmm, that makes sense.\n\nLet me start by considering the structure of the page numbers. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488, which is a three-digit number. So, I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nI think the best approach is to count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately for all page numbers from 1 to 488. Then, sum them up for each digit and compare.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The units digit cycles every 10 numbers: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n   - So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place.\n   - How many such blocks are there from 1 to 488?\n   - Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks of 10 and a partial block of 8 numbers (481 to 488).\n   - In each full block, 4 appears once in the units place, so 48 times.\n   - Now, in the partial block (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once here as well.\n   - So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place in each block of 100.\n   - So, for the digit 4, in each block of 100, it appears 10 times in the tens place.\n   - How many full blocks of 100 are there in 488?\n   - There are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block (401-488).\n   - So, in each full block, 10 times, so 4 blocks give 4*10=40.\n   - Now, in the partial block (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). Wait, let me think: 401-410: tens digit is 0; 411-420: tens digit is 1; ... up to 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digits in 401-488 go from 0 to 8, but only up to 8 in the tens place.\n   - So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place in 401-488? Let's see: 440-449 would be the only set where the tens digit is 4. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n   - Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So yes, that's 10 times.\n   - So, total 4's in tens place: 40 (from full blocks) + 10 (from partial block) = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case.\n   - The digit 4 in the hundreds place occurs from 400 to 488.\n   - How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, hold on, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So yes, 89 times.\n\nWait, but in page numbers, does 400 count? Yes, because the first page is 1, and the last is 488, so 400 is included.\n\nSo, adding up the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nHmm, wait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488, which is indeed 89 numbers, so 89 times. So that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the digit 8.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to the 4's, in the units place, 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 full blocks of 10 (480 numbers) and a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488).\n   - In each full block, 8 appears once, so 48 times.\n   - In the partial block (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 8 appears once here.\n   - Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers, each digit 0-9 appearing 10 times in the tens place per block.\n   - So, for digit 8, in each block of 100, it appears 10 times in the tens place.\n   - There are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block (401-488).\n   - So, 4 blocks give 4*10=40.\n   - Now, in the partial block (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488. That's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers, meaning 9 times.\n   - Wait, but 480 is included in 401-488, right? So, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times.\n   - So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me think again. In the tens place, 8 appears in 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 1,2,3,4. The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only has 488 pages, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up the 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did the tens place correctly for 8's. Because in the partial block 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe I overcounted the 4's in the hundreds place. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 in all those 89 numbers. So, 89 times is correct.\n\nFor the 4's in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. That's correct.\n\nUnits place: 49 times. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's, in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, total 98. That seems correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because I feel like the number of 4's is quite high. Let me try a different approach to verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each place.\n\nFor the units place:\n\n- For both 4 and 8, each digit appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers.\n\nNumber of times a digit appears in units place = (488 // 10) + (1 if the digit <= (488 % 10) else 0).\n\nWait, but I think I did that already. So, for 4: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, and if 4 <= 8 (the last digit of 488), then add 1. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Same for 8: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but in the case of 488, the units digit is 8, so for 8, it's included, but for 4, it's included as well because 4 <= 8.\n\nWait, but when I did the units place for 4, I included 481-488, which includes 484, so that's correct.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to calculate the number of 4's and 8's again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of each digit place separately.\n\nFor units digit:\n\n- The number of 4's is equal to the number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488.\n\nSimilarly for 8's.\n\nSimilarly for tens and hundreds.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use a formula.\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is:\n\nunits = (n // 10) + (1 if d <= (n % 10) else 0)\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place:\n\ntens = (n // 100) * 10 + min(max(n % 100 - d*10 + 1, 0), 10)\n\nWait, maybe that's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, for the tens place, the number of times d appears is:\n\nfull_blocks = n // 100\ncount = full_blocks * 10\nremainder = n % 100\nif d * 10 <= remainder:\n    count += (remainder - d * 10) + 1\nelse:\n    count += 0\n\nWait, let me test this formula.\n\nFor example, for 4's in the tens place up to 488:\n\nfull_blocks = 488 // 100 = 4\ncount = 4 * 10 = 40\nremainder = 488 % 100 = 88\nd = 4, so d*10 = 40\nsince 40 <= 88, count += (88 - 40) + 1 = 49\nso total count = 40 + 49 = 89? Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought it was 50.\n\nWait, no, wait, that's for the hundreds place maybe. Wait, no, this is for the tens place.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm confusing the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how many times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's valid.\n\nEach of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50.\n\nWait, but according to the formula above, when I plug in d=4 and n=488, I get:\n\nfull_blocks = 488 // 100 = 4\ncount = 4 * 10 = 40\nremainder = 88\nd*10 = 40\nsince 40 <= 88, count += (88 - 40) +1 = 49\nso total count = 40 + 49 = 89? That doesn't make sense because we know there are only 50 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nWait, so maybe the formula is incorrect, or I'm applying it wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is for the hundreds place. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, the formula is for the tens place. Let me try applying it correctly.\n\nWait, the formula for the tens place is:\n\nnumber of times digit d appears in tens place up to n is:\n\ncount = (n // 100) * 10\nremainder = n % 100\nif d * 10 <= remainder:\n    count += (remainder - d * 10 + 1)\nelse:\n    count += 0\n\nSo, for d=4 and n=488:\n\ncount = (488 // 100) * 10 = 4 * 10 = 40\nremainder = 488 % 100 = 88\nd*10 = 40\nsince 40 <= 88, count += (88 - 40 +1) = 49\nso total count = 40 + 49 = 89\n\nWait, but that's not matching our manual count which was 50. So, something's wrong here.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.\n\nWait, let's think differently. The number of times digit d appears in the tens place up to n can be calculated by:\n\nFor each hundred block, the digit d appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for n=488, there are 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399). Each contributes 10 times, so 4*10=40.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 numbers (400-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here?\n\nFrom 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 times.\n\nSo, total in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, that's correct. So, why did the formula give me 89? It seems the formula is incorrect or I misapplied it.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is for the hundreds place. Let me check.\n\nWait, no, the formula was for the tens place. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should avoid using the formula and stick to manual counting as I did before.\n\nSo, going back, for the tens place:\n\n- For 4's: 50 times\n- For 8's: in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times, plus the full blocks: 4*10=40, so 40+9=49.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but when I calculated 8's in the tens place, I got 49, which seems correct because in the full blocks, each contributes 10, and in the partial block, 9.\n\nWait, but earlier, for 4's in the tens place, I have 50, which is 40 from full blocks and 10 from the partial block.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nWait, so perhaps my initial approach was correct, and the formula was giving me a wrong result because I misapplied it.\n\nSo, proceeding with that, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot. Let me check each digit place again.\n\nWait, for the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times because from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. That's correct.\n\nFor the tens place, 4 appears 50 times: 40 from full blocks and 10 from the partial block (440-449). That's correct.\n\nUnits place: 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49 times.\n\nTens place: 49 times.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm starting to think that maybe the hundreds place for 4 is 89, which is correct, but perhaps I'm overcounting somewhere else.\n\nWait, let me check the units place again.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 // 10 = 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48.\n\nThen, the remainder is 8 numbers (481-488), and in those, 484 has a 4 in the units place, so 1 more. So, total 49.\n\nSame for 8's: 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, and in the last 8 numbers, 488 has an 8, so 1 more, total 49.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nTens place for 4's: 40 from full blocks, and in the partial block (400-488), 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 more, total 50.\n\nTens place for 8's: 40 from full blocks, and in the partial block, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 more, total 49.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: 89.\n\nHundreds place for 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure because I feel like the hundreds place for 4's is 89, which is correct, but maybe I'm missing something in the tens or units place.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check a smaller example to see if my method is correct.\n\nLet's take a book with 20 pages. How many 1's and 2's are there?\n\nPage numbers: 1-20.\n\nCounting 1's:\n\nUnits place: 1,11,21? Wait, no, up to 20. So, 1,11: 2 times.\n\nTens place: 10-19: 10 times.\n\nSo, total 1's: 2 + 10 = 12.\n\nCounting 2's:\n\nUnits place: 2,12: 2 times.\n\nTens place: 20: 1 time.\n\nTotal 2's: 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nDifference: 12 - 3 = 9.\n\nWait, let's see if my method works.\n\nUsing my method:\n\nFor 1's:\n\nUnits place: 20 // 10 = 2, and since 1 <= 0 (20%10=0?), no. Wait, 20%10=0, so 1 <= 0? No, so units place 1's: 2.\n\nTens place: 20 // 100 = 0, so 0*10=0. Remainder=20, so for d=1, d*10=10 <= 20, so count += (20 -10 +1)=11? Wait, that can't be right because in 1-20, the tens digit 1 occurs in 10-19, which is 10 times.\n\nWait, so perhaps my formula isn't working here. Maybe I should avoid using the formula and stick to manual counting for smaller numbers, and trust my method for the larger problem.\n\nSo, back to the original problem.\n\nI think my method is correct, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me try another small example to verify.\n\nTake a book with 30 pages.\n\nCounting 1's:\n\nUnits place: 1,11,21: 3 times.\n\nTens place: 10-19: 10 times.\n\nTotal 1's: 13.\n\nCounting 2's:\n\nUnits place: 2,12,22: 3 times.\n\nTens place: 20-29: 10 times.\n\nTotal 2's: 13.\n\nDifference: 0.\n\nWait, that's correct because in 1-30, the number of 1's and 2's are both 13.\n\nWait, but let me apply my method:\n\nFor 1's:\n\nUnits place: 30 //10=3, and since 1 <= 0? 30%10=0, so 1 <=0? No, so units place 1's: 3.\n\nTens place: 30//100=0, so 0*10=0. Remainder=30, d=1, d*10=10 <=30, so count += (30-10 +1)=21. That's not correct because the actual count is 10.\n\nWait, so my formula is giving me 21, which is wrong. So, perhaps I shouldn't use the formula and instead stick to my initial method of counting each block separately.\n\nTherefore, I think my initial approach is correct, and the difference is 90.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488 and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering how digits are structured in page numbers. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers can be 1-digit (1-9), 2-digit (10-99), and 3-digit (100-488).\n\nI think I should break down the counting based on the number of digits. Maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\nStarting with the units place. For each group of ten numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. So, for each ten numbers, we have one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n\nBut wait, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of ten are there? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of ten and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in the units place, for the complete groups, each digit 4 and 8 appears 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (484), and the digit 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49, and units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nHmm, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in each hundred. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8.\n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 ones. So, from 1-400, we have four complete hundreds. Each hundred contributes 10 times the digit 4 in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40 times. Similarly, 8 appears 4 * 10 = 40 times in the tens place from 1-400.\n\nThen, we have the remaining 88 pages (401-488). Let's look at the tens place in these. The tens digit in 401-488 goes from 0 to 8, but since we're starting at 401, the tens digits are 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-488). So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for 8, which appears only 8 times because we stop at 488. Wait, no, 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers. So, in the tens place from 401-488, the digit 4 appears when the tens digit is 4, which would be 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So, that's 10 numbers, so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place here. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so yes, 10 times. For 8, in the tens place, it's from 480-488, but wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so that's 9 numbers: 480-488. Wait, but 480 is included, right? So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place from 401-488.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me check again. From 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which is 8. Wait, no, because 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times, not 10. So, in the tens place, from 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total tens place 4's: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 = 50. Tens place 8's: 40 (from 1-400) + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 49 times. So, the difference here is 50 - 49 = 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. In the hundreds place, the digit can be 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488). So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is never 8. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0. Difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let me add up the differences from each digit place.\n\nUnits place: 49 - 49 = 0\nTens place: 50 - 49 = +1\nHundreds place: 89 - 0 = +89\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, so the total number of 4's is 90 more than the number of 8's. Hmm, but let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let's recalculate each place separately.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once more (484). So, total units 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, units 8's: same logic, 48 full groups, 48 times, plus in the remaining 8 numbers, 8 appears once (488). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSo, units place: 49 each, so no difference.\n\nTens place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nEach hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) would have 4 * 10 = 40 times. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so another 10 times. So, total tens 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nIn each hundred, 10 times. So, 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 9 times. So, total tens 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, tens place: 50 - 49 = +1.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 times.\n\n8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so hundreds digit is 4 only. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, hundreds place: 89 - 0 = +89.\n\nAdding up the differences: units (0) + tens (+1) + hundreds (+89) = 90.\n\nWait, so the total number of 4's is 90 more than the number of 8's. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me just make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, another way to approach this might be to calculate the total number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract.\n\nCalculating total 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49\nTens place: 50\nHundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49\nTens place: 49\nHundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that matches. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nAnd in the tens place, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's correct. 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times 8 in the tens place. So, 49 in total.\n\nUnits place: 49 each, so no difference.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total groups of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full groups, contributing 48 instances each.\n   - Remaining 8 numbers (481-488) contribute one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Difference: 49 - 49 = 0\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - From 1-400: 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 40 times.\n   - From 401-488:\n     - 4 appears 10 times (440-449).\n     - 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n   - Difference: 50 - 49 = +1\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 never appears.\n   - Difference: 89 - 0 = +89\n\n**Total Difference:**\n- Units: 0\n- Tens: +1\n- Hundreds: +89\n- Combined: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90\n\nThus, 4's are printed 90 times more than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that each page number is printed once, starting from 1 and ending at 488. So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nMaybe I should start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds, and thousands. Wait, since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to three digits, so the thousands place isn't used. That means I only need to check the units, tens, and hundreds places for both 4 and 8.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's in each place.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The units digit cycles every 10 numbers: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n   - So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - How many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n   - Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then an extra 8 pages.\n   - So, in each complete block, we get one 4 in the units place. That's 48 times.\n   - Now, in the extra 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once more in 484.\n   - So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, in 00-09, the tens digit is 0; in 10-19, it's 1; and so on.\n   - The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, etc.\n   - How many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n   - 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds and an extra 88 pages.\n   - Each complete hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - Now, in the extra 88 pages (400-488), the tens digit runs from 0 to 8 in the hundreds place, but we're looking at the tens place. So, the tens digit is 4 in the block 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488.\n   - So, that's another 10 4's in the tens place.\n   - Therefore, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488.\n   - So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place?\n   - That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.\n   - Wait, no. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4, so each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, the number of 4's in the hundreds place is 89? Wait, no, that's the count of numbers, but each number contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, actually, it's 89 4's. But wait, let me check: from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89). So, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but hold on. The page numbers start at 1, so the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 only in 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that 400 to 488 is 89 numbers. 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes.\n\nSo, total 4's in the hundreds place: 89.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's are 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, units place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus in the last 8 pages (481-488), 484 has a 4 in the units place, so total 49. That seems right.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, so 4 hundreds give 40. Then, in the last 88 pages (400-488), the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. So, 50 in total. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. That adds up to 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in each place.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place.\n   - 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48.\n   - The extra 8 pages (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8. So, 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more.\n   - Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit is 8 in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489.\n   - But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive).\n   - So, how many complete blocks are there?\n   - From 0-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers).\n   - So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9.\n   - So, total 8's in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, the tens digit is 8 in all these, so that's 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, so 4's are 188 and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nBut wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my counting again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, 4's:\n\n- Units: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in 481-488, 484 has a 4 in units, so 49 total. That seems right.\n\n- Tens: Each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in tens place, so 4 hundreds give 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more, making 50. That adds up.\n\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in hundreds place. So, 89. So, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in 481-488, 488 has an 8 in units, so 49 total. That seems right.\n\n- Tens: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\n- Hundreds: 0, as there are no page numbers from 800-899. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's there.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, I have 49. So, 4's are higher by 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly for 4's in the tens place. Each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each contribute 10, so 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. So, 50 in total. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, but in the tens place, only 10 of them have 4 in the tens place. So, that's correct.\n\nI think my counting is accurate. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I should list out the counts for smaller ranges to see if my method works.\n\nFor example, let's say we have a 20-page book. How many 4's and 8's would there be?\n\nPage numbers 1-20.\n\n4's:\n\nUnits place: 4,14 \u2192 2 times.\n\nTens place: 40-49, but since we only go up to 20, none. So, 0.\n\nHundreds place: none.\n\nTotal 4's: 2.\n\n8's:\n\nUnits place: 8,18 \u2192 2 times.\n\nTens place: 80-89, but we only go up to 20, so none.\n\nHundreds place: none.\n\nTotal 8's: 2.\n\nSo, difference is 0. That seems correct because in 1-20, 4's and 8's appear equally in units place.\n\nAnother example: 30 pages.\n\n4's:\n\nUnits: 4,14,24 \u2192 3.\n\nTens: 40-49 not present, so 0.\n\nTotal 4's: 3.\n\n8's:\n\nUnits: 8,18,28 \u2192 3.\n\nTens: 80-89 not present, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 3.\n\nDifference: 0.\n\nWait, but in 1-30, 4's and 8's appear equally. So, the method seems to work.\n\nAnother example: 45 pages.\n\n4's:\n\nUnits: 4,14,24,34 \u2192 4.\n\nTens: 40-44 \u2192 5 numbers, each with 4 in tens place. So, 5.\n\nTotal 4's: 4 + 5 = 9.\n\n8's:\n\nUnits: 8,18,28,38 \u2192 4.\n\nTens: 80-89 not present, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 4.\n\nDifference: 9 - 4 = 5.\n\nSo, 5 more 4's than 8's. Let me check:\n\nPages with 4's in units: 4,14,24,34 \u2192 4 times.\n\nPages with 4's in tens: 40-44 \u2192 5 pages, each with a 4 in tens place.\n\nPages with 8's: 8,18,28,38 \u2192 4 times.\n\nSo, yes, 9 - 4 = 5. So, the method works here.\n\nSo, going back to the original problem, I think my counting is correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should consider how page numbers are structured. Each page number is a three-digit number, right? Because 488 is a three-digit number. So pages 1 to 9 are single-digit, 10 to 99 are two-digit, and 100 to 488 are three-digit. Hmm, maybe I should calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each of these ranges separately.\n\nLet me start by considering single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the only single-digit number that has a 4 or an 8 is 4 and 8 themselves. So, in single-digit pages, there is exactly one 4 and one 8. That means the count for 4's and 8's is the same here, so no difference yet.\n\nNext, I'll move on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I think I should calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place separately.\n\nStarting with the tens place: For two-digit numbers, the tens digit can be 4 or 8, and the units digit can be anything from 0 to 9. So, for the tens place, the number of 4's would be 10 (since 40-49 have 4 in the tens place), and similarly, the number of 8's would be 10 (80-89). So that's 10 each, so no difference here either.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers: Here, 4 can appear in the units place for numbers like 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 times, right? Wait, no, from 10 to 99, that's 90 numbers. So for units digit 4, it's every 10 numbers, so 9 times (since 4 is in 14, 24,...,94). Similarly, for units digit 8, it's 18,28,...,98, which is also 9 times. So again, 9 each, so no difference in the two-digit numbers.\n\nSo, combining the tens and units places for two-digit numbers, both 4's and 8's appear 10 + 9 = 19 times each. So, again, same count, so no difference yet.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This seems more complicated, so I need to be careful.\n\nThree-digit numbers have hundreds, tens, and units places. Let me break it down:\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: For three-digit numbers, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, since the book goes up to 488. So, let's consider each hundreds digit separately.\n\n- When the hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3: The hundreds place doesn't contribute any 4's or 8's. So, for these, I can ignore the hundreds place.\n\n- When the hundreds digit is 4: Then, in the hundreds place, every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, that's 89 4's from the hundreds place.\n\nNow, the tens and units places in three-digit numbers can have 4's and 8's as well. Let me consider each place separately.\n\nStarting with the tens place:\n\nFor three-digit numbers, the tens digit can be 0-9, and the units digit can be 0-9. So, for each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, etc.), the number of times 4 appears in the tens place is 10 times per hundred (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.), and similarly for 8.\n\nBut since the book goes up to 488, I need to be careful with the last hundred, which is 400-488.\n\nWait, so let me break it down:\n\nFor hundreds digits 1, 2, 3:\n\n- Each of these hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 140-149), and 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (e.g., 180-189). So, for each of these hundreds, that's 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, for hundreds 1,2,3, that's 3 hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 3 * 10 = 30 4's and 30 8's.\n\nNow, for the hundreds digit 4 (400-488):\n\nThe tens digit can be from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here?\n\nIn 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in the range 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 4's.\n\nSimilarly, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? It's in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, that's a difference. So, in the tens place for hundreds digit 4, we have 10 4's and 9 8's. So, that adds 10 4's and 9 8's.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place for three-digit numbers: 30 (from 1-3 hundreds) + 10 (from 4 hundreds) = 40.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place: 30 (from 1-3 hundreds) + 9 (from 4 hundreds) = 39.\n\nSo, so far, in the tens place, 4's are 40 and 8's are 39, so 4's are 1 more.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers.\n\nAgain, let's consider each hundreds group.\n\nFor hundreds digits 1,2,3:\n\nIn each hundred, the units digit cycles from 0-9, so for each hundred, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 10 (e.g., 104,114,...,194), and similarly for 8 (108,118,...,198). So, per hundred, 10 4's and 10 8's.\n\nSo, for 3 hundreds, that's 3 * 10 = 30 4's and 30 8's.\n\nNow, for hundreds digit 4 (400-488):\n\nThe units digit can be 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It would be in 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 times.\n\nSimilarly, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It would be in 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 times.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so that's correct, 9 times each.\n\nWait, but wait, in 400-488, the units digit goes up to 8, so for 4's, it's 404,414,...,484, which is 9 numbers, and for 8's, it's 408,418,...,488, which is also 9 numbers.\n\nSo, in the units place for hundreds digit 4, we have 9 4's and 9 8's.\n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 30 (from 1-3 hundreds) + 9 = 39.\n\nTotal 8's in units place: 30 (from 1-3 hundreds) + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, so in units place, both 4's and 8's appear 39 times each. So, no difference here.\n\nWait, but wait, in the hundreds digit 4, units digit 4 appears 9 times, so 30 + 9 = 39, and same for 8's.\n\nSo, in the units place, 4's and 8's are equal.\n\nNow, let me summarize the three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 4's, 0 8's.\n\n- Tens place: 40 4's, 39 8's.\n\n- Units place: 39 4's, 39 8's.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 89 + 40 = 129, 129 + 39 = 168.\n\nTotal 8's in three-digit numbers: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nWait, that seems correct? So, in three-digit numbers, 4's appear 168 times, and 8's appear 78 times.\n\nNow, let's go back and add the single-digit and two-digit numbers.\n\nSingle-digit:\n\n- 4's: 1\n\n- 8's: 1\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- 4's: 19\n\n- 8's: 19\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- 4's: 168\n\n- 8's: 78\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 1 + 19 is 20, plus 168 is 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 1 + 19 is 20, plus 78 is 98.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 188 - 98 = 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, I had:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 4's.\n\n- Tens place: 40 4's and 39 8's.\n\n- Units place: 39 4's and 39 8's.\n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 4's.\n\nAnd 39 + 39 = 78 8's.\n\nThen, adding single and two-digit:\n\n4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\n8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the two-digit numbers, I thought the counts were 19 each, but let me confirm.\n\nWait, two-digit numbers:\n\n- Tens place: 10 4's (40-49) and 10 8's (80-89).\n\n- Units place: 9 4's (14,24,...,94) and 9 8's (18,28,...,98).\n\nSo, total 4's: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nSame for 8's: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nIn single-digit, 4 and 8 each appear once.\n\nSo, 1 + 19 = 20 for each before three-digit numbers.\n\nThen, three-digit numbers:\n\n4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n\n8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n\nSo, total 4's: 20 + 168 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 20 + 78 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the three-digit numbers, especially the hundreds place. Let me check that again.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 400 is the first, 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, that's correct, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place for hundreds digit 4:\n\nNumbers where tens digit is 4: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But since the book ends at 488, 440-449 is entirely within the book, so that's 10 4's.\n\nNumbers where tens digit is 8: 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 8's.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nIn the units place for hundreds digit 4:\n\n4 appears in 404,414,...,484. Let's count: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 times.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears in 408,418,...,488. That's 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 times.\n\nSo, correct.\n\nSo, 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 (hundreds) + 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 108? Wait, no, wait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, no, wait. No, I think I was adding correctly before. Wait, 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n\nWait, but 40 in the tens place comes from 3 hundreds (1,2,3) each contributing 10 4's, so 3*10=30, plus the 10 from hundreds digit 4, so 30+10=40.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in the tens place: 3*10=30 from hundreds 1,2,3, plus 9 from hundreds 4, so 39.\n\nSimilarly, units place: 3*10=30 from hundreds 1,2,3, plus 9 from hundreds 4, so 39.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nSo, 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\n8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm now thinking, is 488 included in the units place? Yes, 488 is included, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the three-digit numbers, the hundreds place for 400-488 contributes 89 4's, which is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider another approach to verify.\n\nAnother approach: For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nIn each block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, total blocks of 10: 488 / 10 = 48 full blocks, with 8 extra numbers.\n\nSo, 48 * 1 = 48.\n\nPlus, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), does 4 appear in the units place? Yes, 484. So, that's one more.\n\nTotal 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nEach block of 10 has one 8, so 48 blocks give 48, plus in the last 8 numbers, 488 has an 8. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSo, 49 4's and 49 8's in the units place. Hmm, but earlier I thought it was 39 in three-digit numbers plus 9 in two-digit numbers, which would be 48, but wait, no, perhaps this approach is different.\n\nWait, no, wait, perhaps I'm mixing up something.\n\nWait, in my initial approach, I considered single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit separately, but this approach is considering the entire range.\n\nWait, perhaps I should do it this way to cross-verify.\n\nSo, using this method:\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488 / 10) = 48, plus if the last number is >= (48 + 1)*10 -1, which is 489, but since we're only going up to 488, we check if 488 >= 48*10 + 4. 48*10 + 4 is 484, which is <=488, so +1. So total 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's: floor(488 / 10)=48, and 48*10 +8=488, which is within range, so +1. So, 48 +1=49.\n\nSo, units place: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor tens digit, each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n\nSo, from 1 to 488, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, etc.), but 488 is in the 400-499 range, but we only go up to 488.\n\nSo, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each.\n\nSo, for each hundred, the number of 4's in the tens place is 10, and same for 8's.\n\nSo, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 4's and 40 8's.\n\nBut wait, the last hundred is only up to 488, so we need to check if the tens digit can go up to 8.\n\nWait, in the last hundred (400-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last number). So, for tens digit 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n\nFor tens digit 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's.\n\nSo, in the last hundred, tens place 4's:10, 8's:9.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in tens place: 3*10 (from 1-300) +10=40.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place: 3*10 (from 1-300) +9=39.\n\nSo, 40 4's and 39 8's in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\n8 appears in the hundreds place from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 8's.\n\nSo, hundreds place: 89 4's, 0 8's.\n\nNow, adding up all places:\n\n4's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 40 = 89, 89 +89=178.\n\n8's: units (49) + tens (39) + hundreds (0) =49 +39=88.\n\nWait, so according to this method, 4's are 178, 8's are 88, so difference is 178 -88=90.\n\nWait, but in my initial approach, I had 188 4's and 98 8's, which is a difference of 90 as well.\n\nWait, but in this method, I get 178 4's, which is 10 less than the initial approach. Hmm, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something in the initial approach.\n\nWait, in the initial approach, I considered single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit separately.\n\nIn single-digit, 4's:1, 8's:1.\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n4's:19, 8's:19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\n4's:168, 8's:78.\n\nSo, total 4's:1 +19 +168=188.\n\nTotal 8's:1 +19 +78=98.\n\nDifference:90.\n\nBut in this other approach, I get 4's:178, 8's:88, difference:90.\n\nWait, so both methods give a difference of 90, but the total counts are different. That suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in one of the methods.\n\nWait, let me check the initial approach again.\n\nIn the initial approach, for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 4's.\n\n- Tens place: 40 4's (30 from 1-300, 10 from 400-488).\n\n- Units place:39 4's (30 from 1-300, 9 from 400-488).\n\nSo, 89 +40 +39=168.\n\nBut in the second approach, units place 4's:49, which is 10 more than 39.\n\nWait, why the discrepancy?\n\nBecause in the initial approach, I considered three-digit numbers separately, but in the second approach, I considered all numbers up to 488.\n\nWait, in the initial approach, for three-digit numbers, the units place 4's were 39, but in the second approach, it's 49. So, perhaps the initial approach missed some 4's in the units place.\n\nWait, no, in the initial approach, for three-digit numbers, I considered 1-3 hundreds contributing 10 4's each in the units place, so 3*10=30, plus 9 from 400-488, totaling 39.\n\nBut in the second approach, units place 4's are 49, which includes single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, so perhaps in the initial approach, I should have considered that the units place includes single-digit and two-digit numbers as well.\n\nWait, in the initial approach, I had:\n\n- Single-digit: 1 4 in units place.\n\n- Two-digit:9 4's in units place.\n\n- Three-digit:39 4's in units place.\n\nSo, total units place 4's:1 +9 +39=49, which matches the second approach.\n\nSimilarly, in the initial approach, I had:\n\n- Single-digit:1 8.\n\n- Two-digit:9 8's.\n\n- Three-digit:39 8's.\n\nSo, total units place 8's:1 +9 +39=49.\n\nAh, so in the initial approach, when I was adding up the 4's and 8's, I was correctly considering all digit places across single, two, and three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, but in the initial approach, I had:\n\nTotal 4's:1 (single) +19 (two-digit) +168 (three-digit)=188.\n\nBut in the second approach, total 4's:49 (units) +40 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=178.\n\nWait, so there's a discrepancy of 10.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach when adding the 4's in the three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, in the initial approach, I had:\n\nThree-digit 4's: hundreds (89) + tens (40) + units (39)=168.\n\nBut in the second approach, units place 4's are 49, which includes single, two, and three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, so in the initial approach, when I added 1 (single) +19 (two-digit) +168 (three-digit), I'm actually double-counting the 4's in the units place for three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, because in the initial approach, the 168 includes the hundreds, tens, and units for three-digit numbers, but the 1 and 19 include single and two-digit numbers, which also have units and tens digits.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because in the initial approach, I considered each digit place separately across all number ranges, but in the second approach, I considered each digit place across all numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should reconcile these two methods.\n\nIn the initial approach:\n\n- Single-digit: 1 4, 1 8.\n\n- Two-digit:19 4's,19 8's.\n\n- Three-digit:168 4's,78 8's.\n\nTotal 4's:1+19+168=188.\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98.\n\nDifference:90.\n\nIn the second approach:\n\n- Units place:49 4's,49 8's.\n\n- Tens place:40 4's,39 8's.\n\n- Hundreds place:89 4's,0 8's.\n\nTotal 4's:49+40+89=178.\n\nTotal 8's:49+39+0=88.\n\nDifference:90.\n\nWait, so both methods give a difference of 90, but the total counts differ because in the initial approach, I included single and two-digit numbers in the three-digit counts, perhaps?\n\nWait, no, in the initial approach, I considered each range separately and added them up, whereas in the second approach, I considered each digit place across all numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps the second approach is more accurate because it systematically counts each digit place.\n\nWait, but in the second approach, the total 4's are 49 (units) +40 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=178.\n\nBut in the initial approach, it's 188. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let me check the units place again.\n\nIn the second approach, units place 4's:49.\n\nWhich includes:\n\n- Single-digit:1 (page 4).\n\n- Two-digit:9 (14,24,...,94).\n\n- Three-digit:39 (104,114,...,484).\n\nSo, 1 +9 +39=49.\n\nSimilarly, units place 8's:1 (page 8) +9 (18,28,...,98) +39 (108,118,...,488)=49.\n\nSo, units place is correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nIn the second approach, 40 4's and 39 8's.\n\nWhich includes:\n\n- Tens place in single-digit: none, since single-digit numbers don't have a tens place.\n\n- Tens place in two-digit:10 4's (40-49) and 10 8's (80-89).\n\n- Tens place in three-digit:\n\n  - Hundreds 1-3:10 4's each, so 30.\n\n  - Hundreds 4:10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place:10 (two-digit) +30 (three-digit 1-3) +10 (three-digit 4)=50.\n\nWait, but in the second approach, I had 40 4's in the tens place. Hmm, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the second approach.\n\nWait, let me recalculate the tens place properly.\n\nIn the tens place:\n\n- For two-digit numbers:\n\n  - 40-49:10 numbers with 4 in tens place.\n\n  - 80-89:10 numbers with 8 in tens place.\n\n- For three-digit numbers:\n\n  - Hundreds 1-3:\n\n    - Each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in tens place (e.g., 140-149), so 3 hundreds *10=30.\n\n    - Similarly, 10 numbers with 8 in tens place, so 3*10=30.\n\n  - Hundreds 4:\n\n    - Tens digit 4:440-449, which is 10 numbers.\n\n    - Tens digit 8:480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place:\n\n- Two-digit:10.\n\n- Three-digit:\n\n  - Hundreds 1-3:30.\n\n  - Hundreds 4:10.\n\nTotal:10 +30 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, total 8's in tens place:\n\n- Two-digit:10.\n\n- Three-digit:\n\n  - Hundreds 1-3:30.\n\n  - Hundreds 4:9.\n\nTotal:10 +30 +9=49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's:50, 8's:49.\n\nWait, so that's different from what I thought earlier.\n\nSo, in the second approach, I had mistakenly calculated the tens place as 40 4's and 39 8's, but actually, it's 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\nSimilarly, in the hundreds place:\n\n- 4's:89 (from 400-488).\n\n- 8's:0.\n\nSo, total 4's:\n\n- Units:49.\n\n- Tens:50.\n\n- Hundreds:89.\n\nTotal 4's:49 +50 +89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n\n- Units:49.\n\n- Tens:49.\n\n- Hundreds:0.\n\nTotal 8's:49 +49=98.\n\nSo, difference:188 -98=90.\n\nAh, so that matches the initial approach.\n\nSo, in the second approach, I had made a mistake in calculating the tens place earlier, thinking it was 40 4's, but actually, it's 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\nSo, that reconciles both methods, giving 188 4's and 98 8's, difference of 90.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that's correct now. So, the final answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - 4 appears once (page 4).\n   - 8 appears once (page 8).\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** 10 occurrences of 4 (40-49) and 10 occurrences of 8 (80-89).\n   - **Units place:** 9 occurrences of 4 (14, 24, ..., 94) and 9 occurrences of 8 (18, 28, ..., 98).\n   - Total: 19 4's and 19 8's.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - **Tens place:** \n     - 10 occurrences in each of the first three hundreds (100-399), totaling 30.\n     - 10 occurrences in 440-449 and 9 in 480-488.\n     - Total: 40 4's and 39 8's.\n   - **Units place:** \n     - 10 occurrences in each of the first three hundreds, totaling 30.\n     - 9 occurrences in 400-488.\n     - Total: 39 4's and 39 8's.\n   - Total: 168 4's and 78 8's.\n\n4. **Total counts:**\n   - **4's:** 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n   - **8's:** 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I think I should consider how digits are used in page numbers. Pages are numbered from 1 to 488, so each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Maybe I should break this down into one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit page numbers separately.\n\nLet me start by considering one-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digits 4 and 8 each appear exactly once. So, for one-digit pages, both 4 and 8 appear once. That means the count for 4's and 8's is equal here, so no difference yet.\n\nNext, I'll move on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Each two-digit number has a tens place and a ones place. I think I should calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place separately.\n\nStarting with the tens place: For two-digit numbers, the tens digit can be from 1 to 9. So, for the tens digit being 4, the numbers would be 40 to 49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, for the tens digit being 8, it's 80 to 89, another 10 numbers. So, in the tens place, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times each.\n\nNow, for the ones place in two-digit numbers: Each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 9 times in the ones place because there are 9 sets of ten (10-19, 20-29, etc.). Wait, no, actually, from 10 to 99, that's 90 numbers, so each digit appears 9 times in the ones place? Wait, no, that's not right. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, from 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers. For each digit in the ones place, it appears once every ten numbers. So, for example, the digit 4 appears in 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 times. Similarly, 8 appears in 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. So, 9 times each. So, in the ones place, both 4 and 8 appear 9 times.\n\nAdding that up, in two-digit numbers, the tens place contributes 10 each for 4 and 8, and the ones place contributes 9 each. So total for two-digit numbers: 10 + 9 = 19 times for 4, and 10 + 9 = 19 times for 8. So, again, equal counts here.\n\nSo, so far, from 1 to 99, the count of 4's and 8's are both 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) = 20 each. So, no difference yet.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is where it might get more complicated because the page numbers go up to 488, which is a three-digit number starting with 4.\n\nI think I should break this down into hundreds, tens, and ones places.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book has 488 pages. So, from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n- 1 appears in 100-199: 100 times. But we're looking for 4's and 8's, so 1 doesn't contribute to either.\n- 2 appears in 200-299: 100 times. Again, not relevant.\n- 3 appears in 300-399: 100 times. Not relevant.\n- 4 appears in 400-488: 89 times (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because we don't have 800-899 pages.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. That's a difference of 89 already in favor of 4.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0-9, but we need to consider how often 4 and 8 appear in the tens place across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488.\n\nWait, but since the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, and the tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 100 numbers, except for the last partial hundred (400-488).\n\nLet me break it down:\n\nFor hundreds digits 1, 2, and 3:\nEach of these will have 100 numbers (e.g., 100-199, 200-299, 300-399). In each of these, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. Wait, no, in each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0-9 ten times each, but actually, for each hundred, the tens digit is 0-9 for each ten numbers. So, for each hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, for hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, each contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place. So, that's 3 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 3*10=30 for 4's and 3*10=30 for 8's.\n\nNow, for the hundreds digit 4 (400-488), the tens digit can be 0-8, because 488 is the last page. So, in 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, each appearing 9 times except for 8, which appears 9 times as well, but wait, let me check.\n\nWait, 400-488 is 89 numbers. The tens digit cycles from 0-8, each appearing 9 times because 89 divided by 10 is 8 full cycles (0-9) and 9 extra numbers. Wait, no, actually, 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is 8 full tens (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488). Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me count.\n\nFrom 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 9 times because 488 is the last page. For example, 400-409: 10 numbers, so tens digit 0 appears 10 times. Similarly, 410-419: tens digit 1 appears 10 times, and so on up to 480-488: tens digit 8 appears 9 times because it's only 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so tens digit 8 appears 9 times. But wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9.\n\nSo, in the tens place for 400-488:\n- Tens digits 0-7 each appear 10 times (e.g., 400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479).\n- Tens digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n\nTherefore, in the tens place for 400-488:\n- 4 appears in the tens place when the tens digit is 4, which is 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n- 8 appears in the tens place when the tens digit is 8, which is 480-488, but that's only 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that for hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, each contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place. So, for 100-399, that's 3 hundreds, each contributing 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place, so 30 each.\n\nThen, for 400-488, in the tens place:\n- 4 appears 10 times (440-449)\n- 8 appears 9 times (480-488)\n\nSo, total in the tens place across all three-digit numbers:\n- 4's: 30 (from 100-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 40\n- 8's: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 40 times, and 8's appear 39 times. That's a difference of +1 for 4's.\n\nNow, moving on to the ones place in three-digit numbers. Again, I need to consider how often 4 and 8 appear in the ones place from 100 to 488.\n\nAgain, breaking it down into hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\nFor hundreds digits 1, 2, 3:\nEach hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) has 100 numbers. In each hundred, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the ones place. So, for each hundred, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times in the ones place.\n\nSo, for 100-399, that's 3 hundreds, each contributing 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the ones place. So, 3*10=30 each.\n\nNow, for hundreds digit 4 (400-488):\nThis is 89 numbers. The ones digit cycles from 0-9 for each tens group. Let's see:\n\nFrom 400-488, the ones digit cycles 0-9 for each tens group, except the last one which might be incomplete.\n\nWait, 400-488 is 89 numbers. Let's see how many complete tens groups there are. From 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, as earlier. Each tens group has 10 numbers, except the last one (480-488) which has 9.\n\nSo, for the ones place in 400-488:\n- For tens digits 0-7 (400-479), each ones digit 0-9 appears exactly once per tens group, so 8 tens groups (0-7) each contribute 10 numbers, so each digit appears 8 times. So, 4 appears 8 times, 8 appears 8 times.\n- For tens digit 8 (480-488), which is 9 numbers, the ones digits go from 0-8, so 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488).\n\nWait, but let me confirm. From 400-479, that's 80 numbers, which is 8 tens groups (400-409, ..., 470-479). Each of these 8 tens groups has 10 numbers, so each digit 0-9 appears exactly once in the ones place per tens group. Therefore, for each digit, it appears 8 times in the ones place for these 8 tens groups.\n\nThen, for the last tens group, 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, the ones digits here are 0-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n\nTherefore, in the ones place for 400-488:\n- 4 appears 8 (from 400-479) + 1 (from 480-488) = 9 times.\n- 8 appears 8 (from 400-479) + 1 (from 480-488) = 9 times.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, in the ones place for 400-488, both 4 and 8 appear 9 times.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. From 400-479, each digit 0-9 appears 8 times in the ones place because there are 8 tens groups, each contributing one occurrence. Then, in 480-488, each digit 0-8 appears once, so 4 and 8 each appear once. So total for 400-488:\n- 4: 8 + 1 = 9\n- 8: 8 + 1 = 9\n\nSo, in the ones place for 400-488, both 4 and 8 appear 9 times.\n\nAdding that to the earlier 30 each from 100-399, the total in the ones place across all three-digit numbers:\n- 4's: 30 + 9 = 39\n- 8's: 30 + 9 = 39\n\nSo, in the ones place, both 4 and 8 appear 39 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the counts for 4's and 8's in three-digit numbers.\n\nIn hundreds place:\n- 4: 89\n- 8: 0\n\nIn tens place:\n- 4: 40\n- 8: 39\n\nIn ones place:\n- 4: 39\n- 8: 39\n\nSo, total for three-digit numbers:\n- 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n- 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, correct. 8 appears 0 times.\n\nIn the tens place, for three-digit numbers:\n- 4's: 30 (from 100-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 40\n- 8's: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39\n\nIn the ones place:\n- 4's: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39\n- 8's: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39\n\nSo, adding up:\n- 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (ones) = 168\n- 8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (ones) = 78\n\nSo, total across all pages (1-488), we have:\n\nFrom one-digit: 4's =1, 8's=1\nFrom two-digit: 4's=19, 8's=19\nFrom three-digit: 4's=168, 8's=78\n\nSo total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me check:\n\n1 (one-digit 4's) + 19 (two-digit 4's) + 168 (three-digit 4's) = 188\nSimilarly, 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the three-digit counts.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times because from 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, each page from 400-488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times.\n\nIn the tens place for three-digit numbers:\n- For 100-399: 3 hundreds, each contributing 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place. So, 3*10=30 each.\n- For 400-488: 440-449 is 10 times for 4 in the tens place, and 480-488 is 9 times for 8 in the tens place.\nSo, 30 +10=40 for 4's, and 30 +9=39 for 8's.\n\nIn the ones place for three-digit numbers:\n- 100-399: 3 hundreds, each contributing 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the ones place. So, 30 each.\n- 400-488: 4 appears 9 times, 8 appears 9 times in the ones place.\nSo, 30 +9=39 each.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit: 89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (ones) =168\nTotal 8's in three-digit: 0 +39 +39=78\n\nAdding up all pages:\n4's: 1 (one-digit) +19 (two-digit) +168 (three-digit) =188\n8's:1 +19 +78=98\n\nDifference:188 -98=90\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if I counted correctly in the three-digit numbers. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another approach: Instead of breaking down into one, two, and three-digit numbers, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nLet me try that approach to cross-verify.\n\nFirst, let's consider each digit place: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nFor units place:\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Similarly for 8.\n\nIn each block of 10 numbers, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, there are 48 blocks of 10, so each digit appears 48 times. But wait, 480 is the last multiple of 10 before 488. So, from 1 to 480, each digit appears 48 times in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488).\n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 48 +1=49\nTotal 8's in units place: 48 +1=49\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier count. Wait, in my earlier count, I had 39 4's and 39 8's in the ones place for three-digit numbers, but now this approach is giving me 49 each.\n\nHmm, that's a discrepancy. I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The units digit from 1 to 488: Each digit 0-9 appears equally in the units place, except possibly the last few numbers.\n\nWait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full cycles of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n\nIn each full cycle of 10, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. So, for 48 full cycles, each digit appears 48 times.\n\nNow, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 48 +1=49\nTotal 8's in units place:48 +1=49\n\nSo, that's 49 each. But in my earlier breakdown, I had for three-digit numbers, 39 each in the ones place, plus one-digit and two-digit numbers.\n\nWait, in the earlier approach, I considered one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit separately, but perhaps I missed something.\n\nWait, in the one-digit numbers (1-9), the units digit is the same as the number itself, so 4 appears once, 8 appears once.\n\nIn two-digit numbers (10-99), the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten, so each digit appears 9 times (since from 10-99, that's 90 numbers, so 9 times each digit in the units place).\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. From 10-99, each units digit 0-9 appears exactly 9 times, because there are 9 tens (10-19, ..., 90-99), each contributing one occurrence of each digit in the units place.\n\nWait, but 10-99 is 90 numbers, so each digit 0-9 appears 9 times in the units place.\n\nSo, in two-digit numbers, 4 appears 9 times in the units place, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nIn three-digit numbers (100-488), the units digit cycles as before.\n\nWait, so total units digits:\n\n- One-digit: 4 once, 8 once\n- Two-digit: 4 nine times, 8 nine times\n- Three-digit: 4 appears 48 (from 100-480) +1 (484) =49 times? Wait, no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the methods. Let me try to approach it again.\n\nUsing the units digit approach:\n\nTotal 4's in units place: 49\nTotal 8's in units place:49\n\nSimilarly, for tens place:\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears in the tens place in each block of 100 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place?\n\nIn each block of 100 numbers, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 00-09, 10-19, ..., 90-99). But since we're starting from 1, the first block is 1-99, which is a bit different.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider from 000 to 488, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the tens digit:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times.\n\nBut let me think differently.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, the number of times each digit appears in the tens place:\n\n- For the tens digit, each digit 0-9 appears the same number of times in each hundred block.\n\nBut let's break it down:\n\n- From 1-99: The tens digit is 0 for 1-9 (9 numbers), and 1-9 for 10-99 (90 numbers). So, in the tens place, digits 1-9 each appear 10 times (e.g., 10-19: tens digit 1 appears 10 times), and 0 appears 9 times (1-9).\n\nWait, but 1-99 is 99 numbers. So, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9 (9 numbers), and 1-9 for 10-99 (90 numbers). So, each tens digit 1-9 appears 10 times, and 0 appears 9 times.\n\nSimilarly, from 100-199: The tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each, so each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSame for 200-299 and 300-399: Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nFrom 400-488: The tens digit cycles 0-8, each appearing 9 times (since 488 is the last number). Wait, no, 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is 8 full tens (400-409, ..., 470-479) and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, in the tens place for 400-488:\n- Tens digits 0-7 each appear 10 times (400-409, ..., 470-479)\n- Tens digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488)\n\nSo, in the tens place across all numbers:\n\n- From 1-99: digits 1-9 each appear 10 times, 0 appears 9 times.\n- From 100-399: each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred, so 3 hundreds *10=30 times each.\n- From 400-488: digits 0-7 each appear 10 times, digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because from 400-488, the tens digits go from 0-8, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times, while 0-7 each appear 10 times.\n\nWait, so let's calculate the total times each digit appears in the tens place:\n\n- For digits 0-7:\n  - From 1-99: 0 appears 9 times, 1-7 each appear 10 times.\n  - From 100-399: each digit 0-9 appears 10 times per hundred, so 3*10=30 times each.\n  - From 400-488: 0-7 each appear 10 times.\n  So, total for digits 0-7:\n  - 0: 9 (from 1-99) + 30 (from 100-399) +10 (from 400-488) =49\n  - 1-7:10 +30 +10=50 each\n\n- For digit 8:\n  - From 1-99: appears 10 times (10-19, ..., 90-99)\n  - From 100-399: appears 30 times\n  - From 400-488: appears 9 times\n  So, total for 8:10 +30 +9=49\n\n- For digit 9:\n  - From 1-99: appears 10 times (90-99)\n  - From 100-399: appears 30 times\n  - From 400-488: doesn't appear\n  So, total for 9:10 +30=40\n\nWait, but I'm trying to find how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nSo, for 4:\n- From 1-99: appears 10 times (40-49)\n- From 100-399: appears 30 times\n- From 400-488: appears 10 times (440-449)\nSo, total for 4 in tens place:10 +30 +10=50\n\nFor 8:\n- From 1-99: appears 10 times (80-89)\n- From 100-399: appears 30 times\n- From 400-488: appears 9 times (480-488)\nSo, total for 8 in tens place:10 +30 +9=49\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier count. Earlier, I thought 4's in tens place were 40 and 8's as 39, but now this method gives 50 and 49.\n\nHmm, I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me see where.\n\nWait, earlier, I considered three-digit numbers separately, breaking down hundreds, tens, and ones. But perhaps I didn't account for all the numbers correctly.\n\nWait, using this method, the tens place for 4's is 50, and for 8's is 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-99: no hundreds digit, so 0.\n\nFrom 100-399: hundreds digit is 1,2,3. Each appears 100 times, but we're only interested in 4 and 8, which don't appear here.\n\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times (400-488). 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n- 4 appears 89 times\n- 8 appears 0 times\n\nNow, adding up all occurrences:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49 +50 +89=188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49 +49 +0=98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, so that's the same result as before. So, earlier, when I broke it down into one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers, I also got 188 -98=90.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me just cross-verify once more.\n\nAnother way: Calculate the total number of 4's and 8's in each digit place across all numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nUnits place:\n- 4's:49\n- 8's:49\n\nTens place:\n- 4's:50\n- 8's:49\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's:89\n- 8's:0\n\nSo, total 4's:49 +50 +89=188\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98\n\nDifference:188 -98=90\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nI think I've got it right. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Breakdown by Digit Places:**\n   - Consider units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n2. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears equally in the units place.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490) and 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n   - Each digit appears 48 times in the units place from 1-480.\n   - From 481-488, '4' appears once (484) and '8' appears once (488).\n   - Total '4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total '8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n3. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in each hundred.\n   - From 1-99: Each digit 1-9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n   - From 100-399: Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times per hundred, totaling 30 times each.\n   - From 400-488: Tens digits 0-7 each appear 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n   - Total '4's in tens place: 10 (from 1-99) + 30 (from 100-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 50\n   - Total '8's in tens place: 10 (from 1-99) + 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 49\n\n4. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - From 1-99: No hundreds digit.\n   - From 100-399: Hundreds digits are 1, 2, 3, none are '4' or '8'.\n   - From 400-488: Hundreds digit is '4', appearing 89 times.\n   - Total '4's in hundreds place: 89\n   - Total '8's in hundreds place: 0\n\n5. **Total Counts:**\n   - Total '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - Total '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n6. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:**\nThe digit '4' appears 90 times more than the digit '8' in the page numbers.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488, and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the structure of the page numbers. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 up to 488. So, the page numbers will have 1 digit (1-9), 2 digits (10-99), or 3 digits (100-488).\n\nI think I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That way, I can systematically count the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each position.\n\nLet's start with the digit 4.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - In the units place, the digits cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place.\n   - How many such blocks are there from 1 to 488?\n   - Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n   - In each full block, 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times.\n   - Now, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484).\n   - So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers, specifically from x40 to x49, where x can be 0, 1, 2, etc. So, in each 100 numbers, the tens digit is 4 for 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n   - How many such blocks are there in 488?\n   - Let's see, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for numbers 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488).\n   - So, for each hundred, there's a block where the tens digit is 4. Let's count them:\n     - 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers\n     - 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers\n     - 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers\n     - 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers\n     - 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers (since 440-449 is within 400-488)\n   - Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so 440-449 is within that, so that's another 10 numbers.\n   - So, each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, and we have 5 hundreds (0-4). So, 5 * 10 = 50.\n   - Wait, but 400-488 is only part of the 400-499 range, but since we're only going up to 488, does that affect the count? Hmm, in this case, 440-449 is entirely within 400-488, so it's still 10 numbers. So, the count is 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that?\n   - From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nNow, let's check the tens place again. Each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, from 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 is only part of the 400-499 block. However, in the tens place, the 4's occur from 440-449, which is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, yes, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. That seems right.\n\nUnits place: 49, which I think is correct because 488 / 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, plus the last partial block (481-488) which includes 484, so 1 more, totaling 49.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, in every block of 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - From 1 to 488, how many full blocks of 10 are there?\n   - 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48.\n   - The last partial block is 481-488, which includes 488, so the units digit is 8 once.\n   - So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In the tens place, 8 appears in blocks like x80 to x89, where x is the hundreds digit.\n   - Each such block contributes 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - Let's see how many full blocks there are up to 488.\n   - The hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n   - For each hundred:\n     - 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers\n     - 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers\n     - 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers\n     - 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers\n     - 400-488: 480-489 \u2192 but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10, because 488 is the last page.\n   - So, for the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (since 480 is included, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 instead of 10.\n   - So, the first four hundreds (0-3) contribute 10 each, and the fifth (400-488) contributes 9.\n   - So, total 8's in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8.\n   - So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. In the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480 to 488. Let's count how many numbers that is:\n\n480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place for that block. So, yes, 49 in total.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's:\n\nNumber of 4's: 188\nNumber of 8's: 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, earlier I thought the number of 4's was 188 and 8's was 98, so the difference is 90. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me go through each digit place again to make sure.\n\n**Rechecking 4's:**\n\n- Units place:\n  - From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place.\n  - 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48.\n  - The last block is 481-488, which includes 484, so +1, total 49.\n\n- Tens place:\n  - Each hundred has a block where the tens digit is 4, contributing 10 numbers.\n  - From 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10\n  - 100-199: 140-149 \u219210\n  - 200-299: 240-249 \u219210\n  - 300-399: 340-349 \u219210\n  - 400-488: 440-449 \u219210\n  - So, 5 blocks, each 10, total 50.\n\n- Hundreds place:\n  - From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with hundreds digit 4.\n  - So, 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\n**Rechecking 8's:**\n\n- Units place:\n  - Same as 4's, 48 full blocks, 48, plus 488, so +1, total 49.\n\n- Tens place:\n  - Each hundred up to 300-399 has 10 numbers with tens digit 8.\n  - 0-99: 80-89 \u219210\n  - 100-199: 180-189 \u219210\n  - 200-299: 280-289 \u219210\n  - 300-399: 380-389 \u219210\n  - 400-488: 480-488 \u21929\n  - So, 4*10 +9 =49.\n\n- Hundreds place:\n  - No 8's here since we don't reach 800.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 +49=98.\n\nSo, difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I remember sometimes when counting digits, especially in higher places, you might have overlaps or miscalculations, but in this case, I think it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach it differently, by considering each digit place separately for both 4 and 8.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is:\n\nFor each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\n**Units place:**\n\n- For 4's:\n  - From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place?\n  - It's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484.\n  - The number of such numbers is floor(488/10) + (1 if 488 >= (4 mod 10) else 0). Wait, that might be more complicated.\n  - Alternatively, the number is (488 - 4)/10 +1 = (484)/10 +1 =48.4 +1, but since we can't have a fraction, it's 48 full times, plus one more if 488 >=44. Hmm, perhaps better to think as 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, plus the 484, which is the 49th occurrence.\n\nSo, 49 4's in units place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place:\n- 8,18,28,...,488.\n- The last number is 488, which is included.\n- The count is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49.\n\nSo, 49 8's in units place.\n\n**Tens place:**\n\nFor 4's:\n- In the tens place, 4 appears in the range x40-x49 for each hundred.\n- So, for each hundred, that's 10 numbers.\n- How many hundreds are there? From 0 to 4 (since 488 is in the 400s).\n- So, 5 hundreds, each contributing 10 numbers, so 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 is from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's fine.\n\nFor 8's in tens place:\n- Similarly, 8 in tens place appears in x80-x89 for each hundred.\n- For hundreds 0,1,2,3, we have 10 each, so 4*10=40.\n- For the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488).\n- So, total 40 +9=49.\n\n**Hundreds place:**\n\nFor 4's:\n- The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nFor 8's:\n- The hundreds digit is 8 from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: units(49) + tens(50) + hundreds(89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\n8's: units(49) + tens(49) + hundreds(0)= 49+49=98.\n\nSo, difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, so that's the same result as before. So, I think that's correct.\n\nBut let me check again, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 -400 +1=89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems right.\n\nAnother way to think about it: the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so that's 89 4's.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, since the hundreds digit never reaches 8, that's 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, 8's:98, difference:90.\n\nI think that's the answer. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I think I should consider how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the count of 8's from the count of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the digits in each position: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll go through each position separately and count the occurrences of 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each block of 10 numbers. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, each digit appears once in the units place every 10 numbers. But wait, in the first block (1-10), 0 doesn't appear in the units place because page 10 is the first with a 0 in the units place, but page 10 is included. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as 0 to 9 in each block of 10. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there, and then any remaining numbers?\n\nWait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). So, for each complete block of 10, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in the units place. So, for 48 blocks, each digit appears 48 times in the units place. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once, and 8 appears once.\n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 48 (from complete blocks) + 1 (from remaining) = 49.\nTotal 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nHmm, so units place gives both 4 and 8 the same count. So, the difference here is zero. But let's check the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times every block of 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit cycles from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for each 100 numbers. Now, 488 is less than 500, so we have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nSo, for each complete hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would mean 4*10 = 40 times each digit appears in the tens place. Then, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). Wait, no, let's see: 401-410: tens digit is 0; 411-420: tens digit 1; up to 480-488: tens digit 8. So, from 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles through 0 to 8, but how many times does each digit appear?\n\nEach tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times, except for the last one, which is 8 and appears only 9 times because 488 is the last page. Wait, no: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears only 9 times in the tens place for the incomplete hundred. So, for the tens place in the incomplete hundred, 0 appears 10 times (401-410), 1 appears 10 times (411-420), and so on up to 7 appears 10 times (471-480), and then 8 appears 9 times (481-488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages.\n\nWait, no, 480-488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the incomplete hundred.\n\nSo, for the incomplete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears how many times? Let me see: 440-449 would be when the tens digit is 4. So, that's 10 times. Wait, but in the incomplete hundred (401-488), 440-449 is included, so the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. Similarly, 480-488 is 9 pages, so tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. From 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times, except for 8, which appears 9 times because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place:\n\n- 0 appears 10 times (401-410)\n- 1 appears 10 times (411-420)\n- 2 appears 10 times (421-430)\n- 3 appears 10 times (431-440)\n- 4 appears 10 times (441-450)\nWait, no, 440-449 would have tens digit 4, which is 10 numbers: 440,441,...,449. So, that's 10 times.\nSimilarly, 450-459: tens digit 5, 10 times.\n460-469: tens digit 6, 10 times.\n470-479: tens digit 7, 10 times.\n480-488: tens digit 8, 9 times.\n\nSo, in the incomplete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total for the tens place:\n\n- For 4: 4 complete hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 10 in the incomplete hundred, so 50 times.\n- For 8: 4 complete hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 9 in the incomplete hundred, so 49 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times. So, the difference here is 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4, since the book goes up to 488. So, let's see:\n\n- Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (since they are two-digit numbers), so no 4 or 8 in the hundreds place.\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so no 4 or 8 here.\n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, so no 4 or 8.\n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, so no 4 or 8.\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 pages. Therefore, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total for the hundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times.\n- 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, the difference here is 89 more 4's than 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit in each place:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place: 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 each, plus in the last 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once, 8 appears once. So, 48 +1=49 for both, correct.\n\nTens place: Each complete hundred contributes 10 times each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 40 times each. In the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, 40 +10=50 for 4's, and 40 +9=49 for 8's. So, that's correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I thought earlier that in the tens place, 4 had one more than 8, and in the hundreds place, 4 had 89 more, so total difference would be 90. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the units place?\n\nEach block of 10 has one 4 and one 8 in the units place. There are 48 complete blocks (480 pages), so 48 times each. Then, the last 8 pages are 481-488, which have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once, and 8 appears once. So, 48+1=49 for both, correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 times each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds: 4*10=40 for each digit. Then, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Each digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times. So, for 4 in the tens place, it's 10 times in the incomplete hundred, so total 50. For 8, it's 9 times, so 40+9=49. So, that's correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times. So, difference here is 89.\n\nSo, adding up the differences:\n\nFrom units: 0\n\nFrom tens: 1 more 4 than 8.\n\nFrom hundreds: 89 more 4 than 8.\n\nTotal difference: 1 +89=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility I miscounted in the hundreds place? Because pages 400-488 have hundreds digit 4, which is 89 pages. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so hundreds digit doesn't reach 8. So, that's correct.\n\nI think that's right. So, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so 90 more 4's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Count 4's and 8's in the Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 pages (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) has one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks of 10 in 480 pages, contributing 48 each.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one 4 and one 8.\n   - **Total:** 49 each.\n\n2. **Count 4's and 8's in the Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 pages has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n   - 4 complete hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 each.\n   - In 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - **Total:** 50 for 4, 49 for 8.\n\n3. **Count 4's and 8's in the Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, appearing 89 times.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total:** 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\n4. **Calculate Totals and Difference:**\n   - **4's Total:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **8's Total:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n   - **Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should consider how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number, right? So from page 1 to page 488, we have numbers from 1 up to 488. That means the page numbers can be 1-digit (1-9), two-digit (10-99), or three-digit (100-488). I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these numbers and how many times 8 appears, then subtract the two counts to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each range separately: one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nStarting with one-digit numbers (1-9): The only number that has a 4 is 4 itself. So that's one 4.\n\nNow, two-digit numbers (10-99): Here, 4 can appear in the tens place or the units place. Let's count each case.\n\n- In the tens place: The numbers are 40-49. That's 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place, so 10 4's.\n- In the units place: The numbers are 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but 44 has two 4's, but I think I should count each occurrence separately. So from 14 to 94, stepping by 10, that's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So that's 9 4's.\n\nWait, but when I include 44, it actually has two 4's, so I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me check: For two-digit numbers, the units place 4's would be 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 9 4's. But 44 has an extra 4 in the tens place, which I've already counted in the tens place count. So actually, the units place 4's are 9, and the tens place 4's are 10, so total 4's in two-digit numbers would be 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nWait, but 44 has two 4's, so maybe I should count it as two separate 4's? So in the tens place, 40-49 gives 10 4's, and in the units place, 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94 gives 9 4's, but 44 is included in both, so the total 4's in two-digit numbers would be 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19, but since 44 is counted twice, does that matter? No, because each occurrence is a separate digit, so it's correct to count both the tens and units 4's.\n\nSo, two-digit numbers contribute 19 4's. But wait, 44 is included in both counts, but that's okay because each digit is considered separately.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers (100-488). This is where it gets a bit more complicated because the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, but when it's 4, the tens and units digits are limited up to 88.\n\nLet me break this down by hundreds digits:\n\n1. Hundreds digit is 1 (100-199): \n   - The hundreds place doesn't contribute any 4's here.\n   - Now, let's look at the tens and units places for 4's.\n   - Tens place: For each hundred, the tens digit can be 0-9. So in 100-199, the tens digit being 4 occurs in 140-149. That's 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place, so 10 4's.\n   - Units place: Similarly, for each hundred, the units digit being 4 occurs every 10 numbers, so 104,114,124,134,144,154,164,174,184,194. That's 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the units place, so 10 4's.\n   - So in 100-199, total 4's are 10 (tens) + 10 (units) = 20.\n\n2. Hundreds digit is 2 (200-299):\n   - Same as above, the hundreds place doesn't contribute 4's.\n   - Tens place: 240-249: 10 numbers, 10 4's.\n   - Units place: 204,214,224,234,244,254,264,274,284,294: 10 numbers, 10 4's.\n   - Total 4's: 10 + 10 = 20.\n\n3. Hundreds digit is 3 (300-399):\n   - Same approach.\n   - Tens place: 340-349: 10 4's.\n   - Units place: 304,314,324,334,344,354,364,374,384,394: 10 4's.\n   - Total 4's: 20.\n\n4. Hundreds digit is 4 (400-488):\n   - Now, this is where it might differ because the range doesn't go up to 499 but stops at 488.\n   - Let's handle the hundreds digit first: All numbers from 400-488 have a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive), each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 4's.\n   - Now, the tens place: In 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8 (since 488 is the last). So when the tens digit is 4, we have 440-449. That's 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place, so 10 4's.\n   - Units place: In 400-488, the units digit can be 0-9 for each tens group, except for 480-488, which only goes up to 8 in the units place. Wait, but actually, no. The units digit cycles from 0-9 regardless, but since the upper limit is 488, the last few numbers might not complete the cycle. Wait, actually, 488 is the last page, so 480-488 includes units digits 0-8. So, for units digit 4, in each hundred, it's 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. But wait, 484 is within 488, so that's 9 numbers? Wait, no, let's think again.\n\nWait, from 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs in 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because after 484, the next would be 494, which is beyond 488. So that's 9 4's in the units place.\n\nWait, but 400-488 includes 488, so 404,414,...,484. Let me count: 404 is 400+4, then 414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers. So 9 4's in the units place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds digit 4 (400-488):\n- Hundreds place: 89 4's.\n- Tens place: 10 4's (440-449).\n- Units place: 9 4's (as above).\n\nSo total 4's in 400-488: 89 + 10 + 9 = 108.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the units place count. From 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 4's. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's:\n\n- One-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit:\n  - 100-199: 20\n  - 200-299: 20\n  - 300-399: 20\n  - 400-488: 108\nTotal 4's = 1 + 19 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 108.\n\nWait, let me add them step by step:\n\n1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) = 20\n\n20 + 20 (100-199) = 40\n\n40 + 20 (200-299) = 60\n\n60 + 20 (300-399) = 80\n\n80 + 108 (400-488) = 188.\n\nSo total 4's printed: 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's. Hmm, I think I need to count how many times 8 appears in each digit place across all page numbers.\n\nStarting with one-digit numbers (1-9): Only the number 8 has an 8, so that's one 8.\n\nTwo-digit numbers (10-99):\n\n- Tens place: Numbers 80-89. That's 10 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place, so 10 8's.\n- Units place: Numbers 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the units place, so 9 8's.\n- But 88 has two 8's, but I think I'm counting each occurrence separately, so it's okay to have 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 8's in two-digit numbers.\n\nWait, but 88 is included in both counts, but each 8 is a separate digit, so it's correct to count both.\n\nThree-digit numbers (100-488):\n\nAgain, breaking it down by hundreds digits.\n\n1. Hundreds digit is 1 (100-199):\n   - Tens place: For each hundred, the tens digit being 8 occurs in 180-189. That's 10 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place, so 10 8's.\n   - Units place: 108,118,128,138,148,158,168,178,188,198. That's 10 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the units place, so 10 8's.\n   - Total 8's: 10 + 10 = 20.\n\n2. Hundreds digit is 2 (200-299):\n   - Tens place: 280-289: 10 8's.\n   - Units place: 208,218,228,238,248,258,268,278,288,298: 10 8's.\n   - Total 8's: 20.\n\n3. Hundreds digit is 3 (300-399):\n   - Tens place: 380-389: 10 8's.\n   - Units place: 308,318,328,338,348,358,368,378,388,398: 10 8's.\n   - Total 8's: 20.\n\n4. Hundreds digit is 4 (400-488):\n   - Now, the hundreds digit is 4, so no 8's there.\n   - Tens place: The tens digit can be 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So when the tens digit is 8, we have 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), each with an 8 in the tens place. So that's 9 8's.\n   - Units place: In 400-488, the units digit can be 0-9 for each tens group, but when the tens digit is 8 (480-488), the units digit only goes up to 8. So, for units digit 8, we have 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the units place, so 9 8's.\n   - So, in 400-488:\n     - Tens place: 9 8's.\n     - Units place: 9 8's.\n     - Total: 9 + 9 = 18.\n\nWait, let me check the units place in 400-488. The units digit 8 occurs in 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers, yes.\n\nSo, adding up all the 8's:\n\n- One-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit:\n  - 100-199: 20\n  - 200-299: 20\n  - 300-399: 20\n  - 400-488: 18\nTotal 8's = 1 + 19 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 18.\n\nLet me add them step by step:\n\n1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) = 20\n\n20 + 20 (100-199) = 40\n\n40 + 20 (200-299) = 60\n\n60 + 20 (300-399) = 80\n\n80 + 18 (400-488) = 98.\n\nSo total 8's printed: 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations because 90 seems high, and I might have made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, when I calculated the 4's in the hundreds place for 400-488, I said 89 4's because there are 89 numbers from 400 to 488 inclusive. Let me confirm that: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 4's. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place for 400-488, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. Correct.\n\nIn the units place for 400-488, 404,414,...,484 is 9 numbers, so 9 4's. Correct.\n\nSo 89 + 10 + 9 = 108 4's in 400-488, which adds up correctly.\n\nFor 8's, in 400-488, tens place 8's are 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. Units place 8's are 408,418,...,488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So total 18 8's in 400-488. That seems correct.\n\nSo total 4's: 188, 8's: 98, difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the three-digit numbers for 4's and 8's.\n\nWait, for 4's in 100-199, I counted 20. Similarly for 200-299 and 300-399, each 20. So 20 * 3 = 60, plus 108 in 400-488, plus 1 + 19 from one and two-digit numbers. That adds up to 1 + 19 + 60 + 108 = 188.\n\nFor 8's, one-digit:1, two-digit:19, three-digit:20+20+20+18=78, so 1+19+78=98.\n\nSo 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because I thought maybe I overcounted the 4's in the three-digit numbers, especially in 400-488. Let me think again.\n\nIn 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so each number contributes one 4, so 89 4's. Then, in the tens place, 440-449:10 numbers, so 10 4's. In the units place, 404,414,...,484:9 numbers, so 9 4's. So 89 + 10 + 9 = 108, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in 400-488, tens place 8's: 480-488:9 numbers, so 9 8's. Units place 8's:408,418,...,488:9 numbers, so 9 8's. So 18 8's.\n\nSo I think my count is correct, so the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **One-digit numbers (1-9):** Only '4' appears once.\n   - **Two-digit numbers (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: 40-49 (10 occurrences).\n     - Units place: 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94 (9 occurrences).\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit numbers (100-488):**\n     - **100-199, 200-299, 300-399:**\n       - Tens place: Each hundred contributes 10 (e.g., 140-149).\n       - Units place: Each hundred contributes 10 (e.g., 104, 114, ..., 194).\n       - Total per hundred: 20.

    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should consider each digit place separately: the units place and the tens place. Maybe I can calculate how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers go from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, in every set of 10 consecutive pages, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. Similarly, the digit 8 also appears once in the units place every 10 pages.\n\nNow, how many complete sets of 10 pages are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 pages and then 8 extra pages. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times plus one more time in the last partial set (pages 481-488). Wait, no, actually, the last set is 481-488, which is 8 pages. The units digit in those last 8 pages would be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So, the digit 4 appears once in the units place there as well. So, total units place 4's would be 48 (from the complete sets) plus 1 (from the last partial set) = 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, each complete set of 10 pages has one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial set, page 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So, total units place 8's would be 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, that can't be right because I thought 4 and 8 would have the same count in the units place, but maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, no, actually, the last page is 488, so the units digits go up to 8. So, in the last partial set (pages 481-488), the units digits are 1 through 8. So, 8 appears once here, and 4 appears once as well. So, units place counts for 4 and 8 are both 49 each. So, the difference in units place is zero. Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nNow, let's move on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times every 100 pages. So, for example, in pages 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for pages 1-9, 1 for 10-19, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times.\n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages left (401-488).\n\nSo, for the tens place, in each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times, so for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times per hundred, so 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), we need to check how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place. The tens digit in this range is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, ..., up to 8 for 481-490. But since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 appears from 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, the digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place in the last partial hundred. But wait, no, the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 times (480-488). Wait, but page 480 is included in the 401-488 range? Wait, 401-488 is 88 pages, so starting at 401, the next hundred would be 401-500, but we only go up to 488. So, the tens digits in 401-488 go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but we only have up to 488). So, the digit 8 in the tens place occurs 8 times (481-488). \n\nBut wait, let me confirm: from 401-410, tens digit is 0; 411-420, tens digit 1; ... 481-490, tens digit 8. So, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place in the last partial hundred.\n\nSimilarly, how about digit 4 in the tens place? That would be from 441-450, right? So, pages 441-450 have tens digit 4. That's 10 pages, but wait, 441-450 is 10 pages, but in our case, we're only going up to 488, so 441-450 is entirely within 401-488, so digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in the last partial hundred.\n\nWait, but let me check: 401-488 includes 441-450, which is 10 pages, so yes, digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in the last partial hundred.\n\nSo, total tens place counts:\n\nFor digit 4: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 10 in the last partial hundred, so 40 + 10 = 50 times.\n\nFor digit 8: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 8 in the last partial hundred, so 40 + 8 = 48 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, digit 4 appears 50 times, and digit 8 appears 48 times. So, the difference in the tens place is 50 - 48 = 2 more 4's.\n\nNow, let's check if there are any hundreds place digits that are 4 or 8. Since the book is 488 pages, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, pages 1-99 have hundreds digit 0, 100-199 have 1, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (400-488 inclusive). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book doesn't reach page 800. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up all the digits:\n\nFor digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nSo, the difference is 188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the units place calculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, earlier I thought that in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each, but now when I added up, 4's total was 188 and 8's was 97, so the difference is 91. But I'm not sure if I did the units place correctly.\n\nWait, let me go back to the units place. The units digit cycles every 10 pages, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEach 10 pages contribute one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48 times, plus the extra 8 pages (481-488). In those 8 pages, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, the digit 4 appears once more in the units place. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, each 10 pages contribute one 8, so 48 times, plus in the last 8 pages, 8 appears once (page 488). So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSo, that part seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4's, in each hundred, 10 times, so 4 hundreds contribute 40, plus in the last partial hundred (401-488), 441-450 is 10 pages, so 10 more, total 50.\n\nFor 8's, in each hundred, 10 times, so 40, plus in the last partial hundred, 481-488 is 8 pages, so 8 more, total 48.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place would contribute more, but maybe that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this by calculating the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately.\n\nLet me try another approach to verify.\n\nFor each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears: floor(488 / 10) = 48, plus if the last digit is >=4, add 1. Since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8: floor(488 /10)=48, plus if last digit >=8, add 1. Since 8 >=8, so 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears: floor(488 / 100) * 10 = 4*10=40, plus the remainder is 88, so in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? From 440-449, but since we only go up to 488, 440-449 is 10 pages, so 10 more. So total 40+10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in tens place: floor(488 /100)=4, so 4*10=40, plus in the remainder 88, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 pages? Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 pages (480,481,...,488), but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 pages? Wait, 480 is included, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 pages. Wait, but 480 is the 80th page in the 400's, so the tens digit is 8 starting at 480. So, in the last partial hundred, the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times? Wait, but earlier I thought it was 8 times because 481-488 is 8 pages, but actually, 480 is included, so from 480-488, that's 9 pages. So, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me clarify: when considering the tens digit, in the range 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-488. But wait, 480 is within 401-488, so yes, 480 is included. So, from 480-488, that's 9 pages (480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488). So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the last partial hundred.\n\nWait, so that would mean that for the tens place, digit 8 appears 40 (from the 4 hundreds) +9=49 times. But earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 4 in the tens place, in the last partial hundred, 440-449 is 10 pages, so 10 times. So, total 40 +10=50.\n\nSo, correcting that, the tens place for 8's would be 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 8, but now I'm seeing it's 9. Let me check again.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, yes, 9 times. So, digit 8 in the tens place appears 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, digit 4 in the tens place appears 50 times.\n\nSo, now, recalculating:\n\nDigit 4:\n\n- Units:49\n\n- Tens:50\n\n- Hundreds:89\n\nTotal:49+50+89=188\n\nDigit 8:\n\n- Units:49\n\n- Tens:49\n\n- Hundreds:0\n\nTotal:49+49+0=98\n\nSo, difference:188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that's different from before. So, where did I go wrong earlier?\n\nI think I made a mistake in the tens place count for 8's. Initially, I thought it was 8, but it's actually 9 because 480-488 is 9 pages. So, the correct count for 8's in the tens place is 49, not 48.\n\nSo, total 8's would be 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nSo, difference would be 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90.\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 91, but now it's 90. So, which is correct?\n\nLet me recalculate:\n\nUnits place:\n\n4's:49\n\n8's:49\n\nTens place:\n\n4's:50\n\n8's:49\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's:89\n\n8's:0\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, so the correct difference is 90. I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought the tens place for 8's was 48; it's actually 49 because 480-488 is 9 pages, not 8.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 pages, right? 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 pages. So, yes, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the last partial hundred, so 40+9=49.\n\nSo, the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAnother approach: For each digit place, calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) + (1 if 488%10 >=4 else 0) =48 +1=49\n\nNumber of 8's: floor(488/10) + (1 if 488%10 >=8 else 0)=48 +1=49\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100)*10 + (if (488%100) >=40, then (488%100 -40 +1), else 0). So, 4*10=40. 488%100=88. Since 88 >=40, so 88-40 +1=49. Wait, that can't be right because 40-49 is 10 numbers, so it should be 10. Wait, no, maybe I'm using the wrong formula.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to calculate how many full groups of 100 there are, each contributing 10 times the digit in the tens place, and then for the remaining pages, see how many times the digit appears in the tens place.\n\nSo, for tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds:4, each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40.\n\nRemaining pages:88.\n\nIn the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit can be from 0 to 8. The digit 4 appears in the tens place from 440-449, which is 10 pages. Since 440 is within 401-488, so 10 times. So, total 40 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place:\n\nComplete hundreds:4, each contributing 10, so 40.\n\nRemaining 88 pages: the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488 inclusive). So, 40 +9=49.\n\nSo, units place:4's=49,8's=49\n\nTens place:4's=50,8's=49\n\nHundreds place:4's=89,8's=0\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 91, but now I'm getting 90. So, I think 90 is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 pages (488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nI think the confusion was in the tens place for 8's. Initially, I thought it was 8, but it's actually 9 because 480 is included. So, 9 times, making the total 8's in tens place 49, leading to a total of 98 8's.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, and hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **4's:** Each 10 pages contribute one 4. With 48 complete sets of 10 pages, that's 48 times. The last 8 pages (481-488) include one more 4, totaling 49.\n   - **8's:** Similarly, each 10 pages contribute one 8, totaling 48. The last page (488) adds one more, totaling 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - **4's:** Each hundred contributes 10 times. With 4 complete hundreds, that's 40 times. The last partial hundred (401-488) includes 440-449, adding 10, totaling 50.\n   - **8's:** Each hundred contributes 10 times, totaling 40. The last partial hundred includes 480-488, adding 9, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **4's:** Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, totaling 89.\n   - **8's:** No page reaches 800, so 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Hmm, let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should consider how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers can be 1-digit (1-9), two-digit (10-99), or three-digit (100-488). I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for the digit 8, then find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's.\n\nFirst, the units place: For every group of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups and then 8 extra numbers. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times. But wait, in the last partial group (481-488), does the digit 4 appear in the units place? Yes, 484 has a 4 in the units place, so that's one more. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for every group of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, from 1 to 488, how many hundreds are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds and then 88 numbers. In each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so 4 hundreds would give 4*10 = 40 times. Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (from 400 to 488), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10 times. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers. So, hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 is correct.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, for every group of 10, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups and 8 extra numbers. So, units place 8's: 48 times. Now, in the last partial group (481-488), does 8 appear in the units place? Yes, 488, so that's one more. So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For every group of 100, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, from 1 to 488, how many hundreds? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 numbers (401-488). In each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 480-489. But wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, does that mean only 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8? Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers here. Therefore, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's are 188, and total 8's are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 full groups of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus, in 481-488, 484 is the only one, so +1, total 49.\n- Tens: Each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4, so 4 hundreds give 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so +10, total 50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full groups of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus, 488, so +1, total 49.\n- Tens: Each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 8, so 4 hundreds give 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so +9, total 49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** For every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. There are 48 full groups of 10, contributing 48. In the last partial group (481-488), 484 adds one more. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens place:** For every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Four full hundreds contribute 40. In 400-488, 440-449 adds 10. Total: 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, 4 appears in the hundreds place for 89 numbers. Total: 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to 4, 48 full groups contribute 48. 488 adds one more. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens place:** Four full hundreds contribute 40. In 400-488, 480-488 adds 9. Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No occurrence since the book ends at 488. Total: 0.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488, and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll go through each place and calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in each.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in every block of 10 numbers. So, in 1-10, 4 appears once (at 4), and 8 appears once (at 8). Similarly, in 11-20, 4 appears once (at 14), and 8 appears once (at 18). This pattern continues every 10 numbers.\n\nSince the book has 488 pages, the total number of complete blocks of 10 is 48 (because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks). In each block, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, for the units place, 4 appears 48 times and 8 appears 48 times.\n\nWait, but there's an extra 8 pages beyond the 480th page, right? So from 481 to 488, that's 8 pages. So in the units place, 484 would have a 4, and 488 would have an 8. So in this extra partial block, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So adding that to the units place counts, 4 would be 48 + 1 = 49, and 8 would be 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, so maybe the units place doesn't contribute any difference. Wait, but let me check again.\n\nWait, actually, from 1 to 488, the number of complete blocks of 10 is 48, and then the last block is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So in the units place, each digit from 1 to 8 appears once, so 4 appears once and 8 appears once in this last block. So total for units place: 48*1 + 1 = 49 for 4, and 48*1 +1 = 49 for 8. So same count, so no difference in units place.\n\nMoving on to the tens place. In the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every block of 100. So, for example, in 1-100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (40-49), and 8 appears 10 times (80-89). Similarly, in 101-200, same thing, and so on.\n\nNow, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these contributes 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place. So that's 4*10 = 40 for each digit.\n\nNow, what about the remaining pages beyond 400? From 401 to 488. Let's see, the tens digit here would be 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), and 8 (481-488). Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 481-488 is 8 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for pages 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 pages.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, each full set of 10 contributes one digit. So from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times, except maybe the last one. Wait, 488 is the last page, so let me see: 401-410: tens digit 0, 10 pages; 411-420: tens digit 1, 10 pages; 421-430: tens digit 2, 10 pages; 431-440: tens digit 3, 10 pages; 441-450: tens digit 4, 10 pages; 451-460: tens digit 5, 10 pages; 461-470: tens digit 6, 10 pages; 471-480: tens digit 7, 10 pages; and 481-488: tens digit 8, 8 pages.\n\nSo in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times in 441-450, and the digit 8 appears 10 times in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 times. So for 4 in the tens place beyond 400, it's 10 times, and for 8, it's 8 times.\n\nSo adding up, for the tens place: 4 appears 4*10 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50 times. 8 appears 4*10 (from 1-400) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48 times.\n\nWait, but wait, 401-488: from 401-480, that's 80 pages, so 8 sets of 10, each with a different tens digit, so 401-410: 0, 411-420:1, up to 471-480:7, and then 481-490:8, but we only have up to 488, so 8 pages with tens digit 8.\n\nSo, in the tens place, from 401-488, 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 times. So total for tens place: 4 appears 4*10 + 10 = 50 times, and 8 appears 4*10 + 8 = 48 times.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40 for each digit. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 times, and tens digit 8 occurs in 481-488, which is 8 times. So total for 4 in tens place: 40 +10=50, and for 8: 40 +8=48. So 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 48 times in the tens place. So that's a difference of 2 more 4's than 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nWait, so from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, but since we start at page 1, maybe it's not printed as 001, but just 1. So the hundreds digit is 0 for 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nWait, but in page numbers, the hundreds digit is only present when the page is 100 or above. So for pages 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, but since we don't print leading zeros, those pages don't have a hundreds digit. So when counting digits, only pages 100-488 have a hundreds digit.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, how many times does 4 appear? From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. So how many pages is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 pages. So 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, from 800-899, the hundreds digit is 8, but our book only goes up to 488, so 800-899 isn't included. So 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So that's a difference of 89 more 4's than 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor units place: 4 appears 49 times, 8 appears 49 times. Difference: 0.\n\nFor tens place: 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 48 times. Difference: +2.\n\nFor hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times. Difference: +89.\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 2 + 89 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, in the units place, I thought 488 pages, so 48 full tens and one partial. But let me recalculate units place:\n\nEach full block of 10 pages has exactly one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So 488 pages mean 48 full blocks (480 pages) and 8 extra pages (481-488).\n\nIn each full block, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place, so 48*1=48 for each.\n\nIn the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So total units place: 48+1=49 for 4, and 48+1=49 for 8. So units place difference is 0.\n\nTens place: From 1-488, each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so 4*10=40 for each digit.\n\nThen, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. In 401-410, tens digit is 0; 411-420, 1; 421-430,2; 431-440,3; 441-450,4; 451-460,5; 461-470,6; 471-480,7; and 481-488,8.\n\nSo in 441-450, tens digit is 4, which is 10 pages, so 10 4's. In 481-488, tens digit is 8, which is 8 pages, so 8 8's.\n\nSo total for tens place: 4's = 40 +10=50, 8's=40 +8=48. So difference in tens place is +2.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 pages (488-400+1=89). So 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So difference is +89.\n\nAdding up the differences: 0 (units) +2 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 91.\n\nWait, but that seems correct? So 4's appear 91 times more than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check again, because 488 is a 3-digit number, so the hundreds digit is only for 400-488, which is 89 pages. So 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, which is correct.\n\nIn the tens place, from 401-488, the 4 in the tens place occurs in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 4's, and 8 in the tens place occurs in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 8's. So that adds up.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when I count the hundreds place, I'm only counting 4's from 400-488, which is correct. 8's in the hundreds place don't exist because the book ends at 488, so 800-899 isn't included.\n\nSo the total number of 4's is 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99+89=188.\n\nNumber of 8's is 49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 49+48=97.\n\nSo difference is 188-97=91.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So 4's appear 91 times more than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts.\n\nUnits place: 49 each, correct.\n\nTens place: 4's=50, 8's=48.\n\nHundreds place: 4's=89, 8's=0.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, which is a significant difference.\n\nI think that's correct. So the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{91}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, and hundreds) separately.\n\n### Units Place\n- Each block of 10 pages contains one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n- There are 48 complete blocks of 10 pages in 480 pages, contributing 48 occurrences of both 4 and 8.\n- The last 8 pages (481-488) contribute one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n- Total for units place: 49 occurrences of both 4 and 8.\n\n### Tens Place\n- Each block of 100 pages contains 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n- There are 4 complete blocks of 100 pages (1-400), contributing 40 occurrences of both 4 and 8.\n- From 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and the tens digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n- Total for tens place: 50 occurrences of 4 and 48 occurrences of 8.\n\n### Hundreds Place\n- The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences of 4.\n- The hundreds digit is never 8, contributing 0 occurrences of 8.\n\n### Summing Up\n- **Units place**: 49 occurrences of 4 and 49 occurrences of 8.\n- **Tens place**: 50 occurrences of 4 and 48 occurrences of 8.\n- **Hundreds place**: 89 occurrences of 4 and 0 occurrences of 8.\n\n### Total Counts\n- Total 4's: \\(49 + 50 + 89 = 188\\)\n- Total 8's: \\(49 + 48 + 0 = 97\\)\n\n### Difference\n- The difference is \\(188 - 97 = 91\\).\n\nThus, the number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\(\\boxed{91}\\)."

    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I think I should consider how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 all the way up to 488. So, I'll need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 10, the digits 1 through 9 appear once each in the units place, and 0 appears once. But since we're starting at 1, 0 doesn't count here. So, for the units place, each digit from 1 to 9 appears once every 10 pages. \n\nBut wait, the book has 488 pages, so I need to see how many complete groups of 10 there are and then handle any remaining pages. Let me calculate how many complete tens there are in 488. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48 complete tens with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete groups of 10 pages, and then 8 extra pages (481 to 488). \n\nIn each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for the digit 8. So, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 times 1, which is 48, and the same for 8's, so 48 each. Now, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, the digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). So, adding these, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's is 48 + 1 = 49. So, so far, the count is equal for units place.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit changes every 10 pages. For example, from 1-9, the tens digit is 0, but since we're starting at 1, maybe it's better to think of it as 1-9 having no tens digit, but when we get to 10-19, the tens digit is 1, and so on. \n\nEach set of 100 pages has 10 pages where the tens digit is a specific number. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit is 8 for 80-89, which is also 10 times. \n\nBut since the book has 488 pages, we can break this down into 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (like 40-49) and 8 for 10 pages (80-89). So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 times 10 = 40 occurrences of 4 in the tens place, and similarly 40 for 8. \n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. \n\nFrom 401-409: tens digit is 0.\n410-419: tens digit is 1.\n...\n440-449: tens digit is 4, which is 10 pages.\n450-459: tens digit is 5.\n460-469: tens digit is 6.\n470-479: tens digit is 7.\n480-488: tens digit is 8, which is 9 pages (480-488).\n\nWait, but 480-488 is actually 9 pages because 488 is the last page. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). \n\nSo, adding this to the previous count, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 40 (from the four hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50. For 8's, it's 40 (from the four hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49. So, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, 400-488 is part of the 400s, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 400-488. \n\nWait, but the hundreds digit is 1 for 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, and 4 for 300-399 and 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 300-399, that's 100 pages, so 100 times. From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89), so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So, total 100 + 89 = 189 times that 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, how about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up all the occurrences:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 189\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 189 = 288\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtracting 8's from 4's: 288 - 98 = 190.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n- Each 10 pages, 1 four and 1 eight.\n- 488 pages: 48 complete tens, so 48 each, plus the last 8 pages (481-488) where units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred, 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place.\n- 4 hundreds: 4*10=40 each.\n- Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449 (10 pages) and 8 for 480-488 (9 pages). So, tens place: 40 +10=50 fours, 40 +9=49 eights. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears in 300-399 (100 pages) and 400-488 (89 pages), totaling 189.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +189 (hundreds) = 288\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98\nDifference: 288 -98=190\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 190 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears once every 10 pages in the units place.\n   - Total complete groups of 10 in 488 pages: 48 groups (480 pages) with a remainder of 8 pages (481-488).\n   - In each group, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place.\n   - For 48 complete groups: 48 occurrences each.\n   - In the remaining 8 pages (481-488), 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8.\n\n2. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages in the tens place.\n   - For 488 pages, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10 occurrences of 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n   - From 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (440-449) and 8 for 9 pages (480-488).\n   - Total tens place: 40 (from hundreds) +10 =50 for 4, and 40 +9=49 for 8.\n\n3. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Hundreds Place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 300-399 (100 pages) and 400-488 (89 pages), totaling 189 occurrences.\n   - The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total hundreds place: 189 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\n4. **Total Occurrences:**\n   - **4's:** 49 (units) +50 (tens) +189 (hundreds) = 288\n   - **8's:** 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 288 (4's) - 98 (8's) =190\n\n**Answer:**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 190.\n\n\\boxed{190}"

    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should consider all the page numbers from 1 to 488 and count how many times the digit 4 appears and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nI guess I can approach this by looking at each digit place separately: the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place. Maybe I should handle each place one by one and calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every block of 10 numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once and the digit 8 appears once. For example, from 1-10, 4 is in 4, and 8 is in 8. Similarly, from 11-20, 14 has a 4, and 18 has an 8, and so on.\n\nSo, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 pages (since 48*10=480, and 488-480=8). \n\nIn each complete block, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 blocks, that's 48*1=48 fours and 48 eights. Now, in the partial block from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial block, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). \n\nWait, but 488 is included, right? So, in the units place, in the partial block, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So, adding that to the previous counts, the total number of 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's, 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, they are equal. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong because 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, in the units place, 4 and 8 each appear 49 times.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. 48 complete blocks give 48 fours and 48 eights. The partial block from 481 to 488: the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, yes, units place: 49 fours and 49 eights.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, for each block of 100, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, in each 100-number block, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n\nSo, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is less than 500, so there are four complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, that's actually five blocks, but the last one isn't a complete hundred. Hmm, maybe I should think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider each hundred separately. Let me break it down:\n\n1. Pages 1-100: The tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (40-49) and 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n\n2. Pages 101-200: Similarly, the tens digits go from 0-9 again. So, 140-149 has 10 fours, and 180-189 has 10 eights.\n\n3. Pages 201-300: The same applies. 240-249 has 10 fours, and 280-289 has 10 eights.\n\n4. Pages 301-400: Again, 340-349 has 10 fours, and 380-389 has 10 eights.\n\n5. Pages 401-488: Now, this is a partial hundred. The tens digits go from 0-8 (since 488 is 4 8 8). So, in the tens place, how many times do 4 and 8 appear?\n\nWait, in the tens place for 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for each ten's digit, how many times does it appear? From 401-410, tens digit is 0; 411-420, tens digit is 1; and so on up to 481-488, tens digit is 8.\n\nSo, for each tens digit, it appears 10 times, except maybe the last one if it's partial. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the tens digit in 481-488 is 8, and there are 8 pages (481-488), so the tens digit 8 appears 8 times here, right?\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The tens digit is determined by the second digit from the right. So, for 401-410, the tens digit is 0, and there are 10 pages. Similarly, 411-420, tens digit is 1, 10 pages, and so on up to 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the last block is 481-488, which is 8 pages, so the tens digit is 8, appearing 8 times.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, the digit 4 would appear in the block where the tens digit is 4. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in the block 440-449. So, from 440-449, that's 10 pages, so the tens digit 4 appears 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, the tens digit 8 appears in the block 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 pages (480-488). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 pages, but we only have up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in this partial block.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. Pages 480-488: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 pages, so the tens digit is 8 in all of these, so 9 times.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, when the tens digit is 8, the number of times it appears is equal to the number of pages in that block. So, in 480-489, it's 10 pages, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the 401-488 block.\n\nWait, but in the units place, we had 8 appearing once in 488. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in 480-488. Hmm, but earlier, in the units place, we had 8 appearing once in 488. So, maybe I should separate these.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach.\n\nFor the tens place, in the range 1-488, how many times does 4 appear?\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, and 301-400, each has 10 fours in the tens place (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40 fours in the tens place from 1-400.\n\nNow, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in the block 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 fours.\n\nSo, total fours in the tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50 fours.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place:\n\nIn each hundred, 1-100, 101-200, etc., each has 10 eights in the tens place (80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4 hundreds contribute 4*10=40 eights.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 eights.\n\nSo, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, so in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times. So, 50 fours and 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, which is correct, and 8 appears 9 times. So, yes, 50 fours and 49 eights.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, the digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case because the book has 488 pages, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Only in the range 401-488. That's 88 pages (from 401 to 488), but the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages. So, the digit 4 appears 88 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-499, but our book ends at 488, so from 400-488, that's 89 pages (including 400). Wait, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 pages. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit can't be 8 because 800 is beyond 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8 in this book. So, zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total fours in the hundreds place: 89, and eights: 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\n- Fours: 49\n- Eights: 49\n\nTens place:\n\n- Fours: 50\n- Eights: 49\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- Fours: 89\n- Eights: 0\n\nNow, adding them all up.\n\nTotal fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, total fours: 188, total eights: 98.\n\nTherefore, the number of fours printed is 188 - 98 = 90 more than the number of eights.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a significant difference, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place: 49 fours and 49 eights. That seems correct because in each block of 10, both appear once, and the partial block also contributes once each.\n\nTens place: 50 fours and 49 eights. Let me verify that.\n\nIn the tens place, from 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 40 fours and 40 eights.\n\nFrom 401-488, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, 40 + 10 = 50 fours, and 40 + 9 = 49 eights. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 89 fours and 0 eights. Because from 400-488, which is 89 pages, the hundreds digit is 4. So, 89 fours.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\nFours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nEights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but I want to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, right? Because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but does the hundreds digit include 400? Yes, because 400 is included in the book. So, 400 is page 400, which has a hundreds digit of 4. So, yes, 89 fours.\n\nAnd for the eights, since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 9 eights. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 480-488 is 9 pages, but 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 pages, so that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, from 481-488, the units digit 8 appears once at 488, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I was calculating the units place, I had 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8, and then the partial block of 8 pages contributing one 4 (at 484) and one 8 (at 488). So, 48 + 1 = 49 fours and 48 + 1 = 49 eights. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so 488 is the last page, so yes, that 8 is counted.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the total number of fours is 188 and eights is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because I thought maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me think again.\n\nFrom 1-488, how many times does the hundreds digit equal 4? It's from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nAnd in the tens place, as we calculated, 50 fours and 49 eights.\n\nUnits place: 49 fours and 49 eights.\n\nSo, adding up, fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nEights: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the number of fours printed is 90 more than the number of eights.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units Place Analysis:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks of 10, contributing 48 fours and 48 eights.\n   - The partial block from 481 to 488 contributes one 4 (at 484) and one 8 (at 488).\n   - Total fours in units place: \\(48 + 1 = 49\\)\n   - Total eights in units place: \\(48 + 1 = 49\\)\n\n2. **Tens Place Analysis:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place.\n   - For the first 400 pages, there are 4 blocks of 100, contributing \\(4 \\times 10 = 40\\) fours and \\(4 \\times 10 = 40\\) eights.\n   - From 401 to 488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and the tens digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total fours in tens place: \\(40 + 10 = 50\\)\n   - Total eights in tens place: \\(40 + 9 = 49\\)\n\n3. **Hundreds Place Analysis:**\n   - The hundreds digit 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages.\n   - The hundreds digit 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total fours in hundreds place: 89\n   - Total eights in hundreds place: 0\n\nSumming up the counts:\n- Total fours: \\(49\\) (units) + \\(50\\) (tens) + \\(89\\) (hundreds) = \\(188\\)\n- Total eights: \\(49\\) (units) + \\(49\\) (tens) + \\(0\\) (hundreds) = \\(98\\)\n\nThe difference is:\n\\[ 188 - 98 = 90 \\]\n\nThus, the number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\(\\boxed{90}\\)."

    "text": " Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I guess I should consider how page numbers are structured. Pages go from 1 to 488, so each page number is a one, two, three, or four-digit number. But since 488 is a three-digit number, the page numbers go up to three digits, right? So, I can break down the problem by looking at the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place separately for each digit.\n\nWait, but 488 is a three-digit number, so maybe I should consider each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately and count how many times 4 appears in each position and how many times 8 appears in each position. Then, I can sum them up and find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position one by one.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the digit 4 appears once every 10 pages, and so does the digit 8.\n\nBut wait, the book has 488 pages. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then an extra 8 pages.\n\nIn each complete block, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 48 times in the units place.\n\nNow, for the extra 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, adding that to the previous counts, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 times for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 times for 8. Wait, that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so the last page is 488, which is included in the 488 pages. So, the extra 8 pages are 481 to 488, which is 8 pages, right? So, in the units place, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. Hmm, so in the units place, they are equal.\n\nWait, but let me check that. If I have 488 pages, then the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48 (from each 10 pages) plus 1 more in the last partial block, making 49. Similarly, 8 appears 48 times plus 1, so 49 times. So, in units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. So, no difference there.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, the cycle is every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8.\n\nSince the book has 488 pages, that's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an extra 88 pages (401-488). So, in the tens place, for each hundred, 4 appears 10 times, so 4 times 10 is 40. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times per hundred, so 40 times in total.\n\nNow, in the extra 88 pages (401-488), we need to check how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place. Let's break it down:\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 in each ten pages. So, for the tens place, 4 appears in the 40s, which is from 400-499, but since we're only going up to 488, the 40s in the tens place would be from 400-409, 410-419, etc., up to 480-488. Wait, no, actually, in the tens place, the digit is fixed for each set of ten. So, for example, in 400-409, the tens digit is 0; in 410-419, it's 1; and so on up to 480-488, where the tens digit is 8.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the tens digit is the second digit from the right. So, for 400-409, the tens digit is 0. For 410-419, it's 1, and so on up to 480-489, but we only go up to 488. So, in the extra 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8.\n\nSo, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, when the tens digit is 4, that's from 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 times. Similarly, when the tens digit is 8, that's from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 times (480-488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for each of those 9 numbers. So, 9 times.\n\nWait, but wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 0 in 400-409, 1 in 410-419, ..., up to 8 in 480-488. So, for the tens digit being 4, it's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. For the tens digit being 8, it's from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nWait, but in the first 400 pages, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 four times (for each hundred), so each digit appears 10 times per hundred, so 4 times 10 is 40 for 4 and 8 each. Now, in the extra 88 pages (401-488), how does that affect?\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the entire 488 pages as 4 full hundreds (1-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). So, in the tens place, for the first 400 pages, 4 appears 4 times 10 = 40 times, and 8 appears 4 times 10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, in the 88 pages from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears once when the tens digit is 4, which is 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, that's 10 more times for 4. And 8 appears when the tens digit is 8, which is 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 more times for 8.\n\nWait, but wait, in the 401-488 range, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit, how many times does it occur? For example, tens digit 0: 400-409, which is 10 pages, but since we're starting from 401, it's 9 pages? Wait, no, 400 is included in the first 400, so 401-409 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 0. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think that in the 401-488 range, the tens digit cycles through 0 to 8, each for 10 pages except the last one, which is 8 and goes up to 488, which is 9 pages. So, in the tens place, for each digit from 0 to 8, it appears 10 times except for 8, which appears 9 times.\n\nWait, but that might not be accurate because 401-488 is 88 pages, which is 8 full tens (each 10 pages) and 8 pages. Wait, no, 88 divided by 10 is 8 with a remainder of 8, so 8 full tens and 8 pages. So, each tens digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times, and the tens digit 8 appears 8 times? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. For the tens digit in 401-488:\n\n- The tens digit is 0 for pages 400-409, but since we start at 401, that's 9 pages (401-409).\n- The tens digit is 1 for pages 410-419: 10 pages.\n- Similarly, tens digits 2 through 7 each have 10 pages.\n- The tens digit is 8 for pages 480-488: 9 pages.\n\nWait, so in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 0 appears 9 times, digits 1-7 appear 10 times each, and digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, in 401-488, 4 appears once (when tens digit is 4, which is 440-449, but in 401-488, it's 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times). Wait, but wait, 440 is within 401-488, so 440-449 is 10 pages, so the tens digit 4 appears 10 times in 401-488. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times because it's from 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times in the extra 88 pages.\n\nTherefore, in the entire book:\n\n- For the tens place, 4 appears 40 (from first 400 pages) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50 times.\n- For the tens place, 8 appears 40 (from first 400 pages) + 9 (from 401-488) = 49 times.\n\nWait, that seems right. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times. So, 4 is appearing once more in the tens place than 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is the third digit from the right. For the first 99 pages, the hundreds digit is 0, but since we're starting at page 1, maybe we can ignore that as leading zeros aren't printed. So, the hundreds digit starts appearing from page 100 onwards.\n\nIn the hundreds place, each digit from 1 to 4 appears for 100 pages each. Wait, 1 appears from 100-199 (100 pages), 2 from 200-299, 3 from 300-399, and 4 from 400-499. But our book ends at 488, so the hundreds digit 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, how many times does 4 appear? From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those pages, so 89 times.\n\nHow about 8? The hundreds digit 8 would appear from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal for 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nFor 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal for 8: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 488 pages. Each 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once in units place. So, 48 full tens, so 48 each, plus in the last 8 pages (481-488), 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: For the first 400 pages, 4 appears 40 times (4 times 10 per hundred), and 8 appears 40 times. In the extra 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total for tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8. That seems right.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488. So, 0 times for 8. That seems correct.\n\nAdding up: 4's total is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. 8's total is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When I was counting the hundreds place, I considered 400-488 as 89 pages, but let me verify that. 488 minus 400 is 88, but since both endpoints are included, it's 89 pages. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAnother check: Let's count how many times 4 appears in each position.\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), 484 has a 4 in units place, so 1 more, total 49.\n\nTens place: In the first 400 pages, 4 appears 10 times per hundred, so 4 times 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (440-449), so 10 more, total 50.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears for 89 pages (400-488), so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial block, 488 has an 8 in units place, so 1 more, total 49.\n\nTens place: In the first 400 pages, 8 appears 10 times per hundred, so 40. In 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages (480-488), so 9 more, total 49.\n\nHundreds place: 8 never appears, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90, so there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I think I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488, and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I remember that in problems like this, breaking it down by each digit place helps avoid missing any numbers.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, in each set of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), 4 appears once. So the total number of times 4 appears in the units place is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of an appearance, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 488 is the last number, so actually, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48 full groups, and then 8 extra numbers. Since 488 is the 489th number, but we're only going up to 488, so the last group is 481-490, but we stop at 488, so in the units place, 4 appears 48 times. Hmm, that seems right.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, it's in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more numbers (401-488). So in each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4 hundreds would give 4*10 = 40 times. But wait, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is another 10 times. So total for tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 times. Wait, but 401-488 includes 440-449, which is correct. So yes, 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these 89 numbers. So 89 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So 4 appears 187 times.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So from 1-488, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, the last group is 481-490, but we stop at 488, so the units digit 8 appears in 488, which is the 48th group. So units place: 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears 10 times every 100 numbers, in the tens place. So from 1-100, it's 80-89, which is 10 times. So in each hundred, 10 times. There are 4 full hundreds (1-400), so 4*10 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but we only go up to 488, so that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So in the tens place, that's 9 times. So total for tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So 0 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. So how many numbers is that? 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times. So yes, 49 times in the tens place.\n\nSo total 8's are 97.\n\nWait, but earlier for 4's, I had 187. So the difference would be 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 times (since 488/10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 in the units place).\n- Tens place: In each hundred, 10 times, so 4 hundreds give 40, plus in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, so 40 + 10 = 50.\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 times (since 488/10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles).\n- Tens place: In each hundred, 10 times, so 4 hundreds give 40. In the last partial hundred, 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. Total 49.\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 48 + 49 = 97.\n\nSo difference: 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I counted correctly in the units place for 4's. Let me think again.\n\nThe units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nNumber of complete tens: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete tens, each contributing one 4. Then, in the incomplete last ten (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (at 484). So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. I thought it was 48, but actually, it's 49 because the last partial group also includes a 4 in the units place.\n\nWait, so let me correct that.\n\nSo units place for 4's: 48 complete groups (1-480) give 48 times, and then 481-488 includes 484, which is another 4 in the units place. So total 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place: from 1-488, how many 8's? Each 10 numbers contribute one 8 in the units place, so 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8. The last partial group (481-488) has 488, which is an 8 in the units place, so that's another 8. So total 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake earlier. So units place for 4's is 49, not 48. Let me adjust that.\n\nSo 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, no, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So 4's appear 188 times.\n\n8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place for 4's was 48, but now I'm getting 49. Which is correct?\n\nLet me think. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place?\n\nThe first number is 4, then 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So how many terms are there in this sequence?\n\nThe sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n\nThis is an arithmetic sequence where the first term a1=4, common difference d=10.\n\nThe nth term is given by a_n = a1 + (n-1)d.\n\nWe need a_n \u2264 488.\n\nSo 4 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488.\n\n(n-1)*10 \u2264 484\n\nn-1 \u2264 48.4\n\nn \u2264 49.4\n\nSo n=49 terms. So 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, the sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n\na1=8, d=10.\n\na_n = 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488.\n\n(n-1)*10 \u2264 480\n\nn-1 \u2264 48\n\nn=49.\n\nSo both 4's and 8's in the units place appear 49 times.\n\nSo I think I made a mistake earlier by not considering the last partial group correctly. So units place for 4's is 49, not 48.\n\nSo updating:\n\n4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 187, but now it's 188. So which is correct?\n\nLet me recount the tens place for 4's.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n\nEach of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, each contributing 10 times. Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but in the hundreds place, we've already counted 400-488 as 89 numbers. Wait, but in the tens place, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct.\n\nWait, so how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nFrom 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10\n- 240-249: 10\n- 340-349: 10\n- 440-449: 10\n\nThat's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nSo 4's total: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: Let's see, in the tens place, 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n\nEach of the first four sets (80-89, etc.) is 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last set, 480-488, is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo 8's total: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 187, but now it's 188. So I think the correct total is 188 for 4's and 98 for 8's, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double count anything. For example, in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, which is correct.\n\nIn the tens place, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 more 4's in the tens place, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, the tens place includes 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nI think this makes sense. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check once more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately and sum them up.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: As we saw, 49 times.\n- Tens place: 50 times.\n- Hundreds place: 89 times.\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49 times.\n- Tens place: 49 times.\n- Hundreds place: 0 times.\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, this happens 49 times (including 484).\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449, totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (including 488).\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488, totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place up to 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should figure out how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488, and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense.\n\nLet me start by considering the structure of page numbers. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488, which is a three-digit number. So, I need to analyze each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nI remember that when counting digits, it's helpful to look at each place (units, tens, hundreds) individually because the number of times a digit appears in each place can be calculated separately and then summed up.\n\nLet me start by counting how many times the digit 4 appears in each place.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers.\n   - So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place.\n   - How many such blocks are there from 1 to 488?\n   - Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10, and then a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488).\n   - In each complete block, there's one 4 in the units place, so 48 * 1 = 48 times.\n   - Now, in the partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484).\n   - So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 100 numbers.\n   - In each block of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n   - So, in each 100-number block, there are 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n   - How many complete 100-number blocks are there in 488?\n   - 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block from 401-488.\n   - In each complete block, 10 times 4's in the tens place: 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - Now, the partial block from 401-488: the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, etc., up to 8 for 481-490. But since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit goes up to 8, but the exact number of 4's in the tens place here is 10 (from 440-449). Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10 occurrences.\n   - Wait, but wait, 401-488 is 88 numbers, right? So, the tens digit cycles every 10. So, from 401-488, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? It would be from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n   - So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 (from complete blocks) + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (including both 400 and 488).\n   - Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 occurrences.\n   - Wait, but 400 is the first number with hundreds digit 4, and 488 is the last. So, from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.\n   - So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, I had 4 complete hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-9, so 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 more. So, 40 +10=50. That seems right.\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens (1-480) give 48 4's, and then 484 adds one more, so 49. Correct.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 +50 +89=188.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, in every block of 10, 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - From 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 48 complete blocks (1-480), and a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488).\n   - Each complete block contributes 1, so 48 *1=48.\n   - In the partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (488).\n   - So, total 8's in units place: 48 +1=49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In each block of 100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each.\n   - So, in each 100-number block, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n   - There are 4 complete 100-number blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 8's in the tens place: 4*10=40.\n   - Now, the partial block from 401-488: the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488), so 9 occurrences.\n   - Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, right? So, that's 9 times 8 in the tens place.\n   - So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 (from complete blocks) +9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - So, 0 occurrences.\n\nAdding up all the 8's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98.\n\nWait, so total 4's are 188 and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I did the tens place correctly for 8's. Let me check again.\n\nIn the tens place for 8's:\n\n- From 1-400, there are 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place: 4*10=40.\n- From 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So, when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 480-488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times 8 in the tens place.\n- So, 40 +9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place for 8's:\n\n- 48 complete blocks of 10, each giving one 8: 48.\n- Partial block 481-488: units digit 8 at 488: 1.\n- Total:49.\n\nSo, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nAnd for 4's, total was 188.\n\nSo, 188 -98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nUnits place: 49, tens place:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 8's:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. 98 total.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for 8's would have some numbers, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences, correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - In every block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once. There are 48 complete blocks (1-480) contributing 48 occurrences, plus one more in 484, totaling 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In every block of 100, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Four complete blocks (1-400) contribute 40 occurrences. From 401-488, 440-449 adds 10 more, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - From 400-488, each number has a hundreds digit of 4, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. 48 complete blocks contribute 48, plus one in 488, totaling 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In every block of 100, 8 appears 10 times. Four complete blocks contribute 40. From 401-488, 480-488 adds 9 more, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place, contributing 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit '4' appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488, and then do the same for the digit '8'. After that, I can subtract the number of '8's from the number of '4's to find the difference. Hmm, sounds logical.\n\nLet me start by considering how digits are arranged in page numbers. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 up to 488. So, the page numbers can be 1-digit (1-9), two-digit (10-99), and three-digit (100-488).\n\nI think the best approach is to analyze each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. For each position, I can calculate how many times '4' and '8' appear.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each block, '4' appears once and '8' appears once. For example, from 1-10, '4' is in 4, and '8' is in 8. Similarly, 11-20: '4' is in 14, '8' in 18, and so on.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there from 1 to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in the units place, for each block of 10, '4' and '8' each appear once. So, for 48 blocks, that's 48 '4's and 48 '8's in the units place.\n\nBut wait, there are also the extra 8 numbers: 481-488. Let me check the units digits here. The units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, '4' appears once (484) and '8' appears once (488). So, adding that, units place gives us 48 + 1 = 49 '4's and 48 + 1 = 49 '8's. Wait, that seems balanced. So, units place contributes equally to both '4's and '8's. Hmm, maybe I should check that again.\n\nWait, no, 488 is the last page, so from 1 to 488, the number of units digits is 488. So, the number of complete blocks is 48, each contributing one '4' and one '8', so that's 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8. So, in these, '4' is in 484, so one more '4', and '8' is in 488, so one more '8'. So, total '4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49, and '8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place contributes equally, 49 each.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the tens digit goes from 0-9 ten times each. So, for each '4' in the tens place, it appears 10 times (e.g., 40-49), and similarly for '8' (80-89).\n\nSo, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? Well, 400 is the start of the fourth hundred. So, from 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nWait, so that's five blocks: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nIn each of the first four blocks (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit '4' appears 10 times each, so that's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 '4's. Similarly, '8' appears 10 times in each of these blocks, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 '8's.\n\nNow, the last block is 400-488. The tens digit here goes from 0 to 8 because 488 is the end. So, in the tens place, '4' would appear in 440-449, which is 10 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does that affect the count? Let me see: from 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, '4' is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 '4's in the tens place. Similarly, '8' is in 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, '8' appears 9 times here.\n\nWait, so in 400-488, the tens digit '8' appears in 480-488, which is 9 times, not 10, because 488 is included. So, does that mean in the tens place, '8' appears 9 times in this block?\n\nSo, total '4's in tens place: 40 (from first four blocks) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50 '4's.\n\nTotal '8's in tens place: 40 (from first four blocks) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49 '8's.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me check again. From 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409), 1 (410-419), ..., up to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, each appears 10 times except for 8, which appears 9 times because the last number is 488, not 489. So, '8' in the tens place appears 9 times in 480-488.\n\nSo, for '4's in the tens place, it's 10 times in 440-449, so that's 10 '4's. So, total '4's in tens place: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 + 10 = 50.\n\nFor '8's in tens place: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, '4's are 50 and '8's are 49. So, '4's have 1 more in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is '4' only in the last block, 400-488. So, how many times does '4' appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89), so '4' appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about '8's in the hundreds place? Well, in the range 1-488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. '8' doesn't appear in the hundreds place because 800 would be beyond 488. So, '8's in the hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, '4's are 89, '8's are 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor '4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal '4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor '8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal '8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more '4's are printed than '8's. So, subtract the number of '8's from the number of '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place: 48 full decades, each contributing one '4' and one '8', so 48 each. Then, the last 8 numbers (481-488) have '4' once and '8' once, so 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, '4' and '8' each appear 10 times in the tens place. So, first four hundreds (1-399) contribute 4\u00d710=40 each. Then, in 400-488, '4' appears 10 times (440-449) and '8' appears 9 times (480-488). So, '4's: 40+10=50, '8's:40+9=49. That seems right.\n\nHundreds place: '4' appears 89 times (400-488), '8' appears 0 times. So, that's correct.\n\nAdding up: '4's:49+50+89=188, '8's:49+49+0=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, so 90 more '4's than '8's. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so '4' appears 89 times in the hundreds place. That's correct because each of those numbers starts with '4'.\n\nAnd '8' never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so no page numbers from 800-899. So, '8's in hundreds place: 0. Correct.\n\nTens place: For 400-488, '8' in the tens place is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 '8's. Correct.\n\nI think that's accurate. So, the answer should be 90 more '4's than '8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count the units place correctly? Let me recount.\n\nFrom 1-488, how many times does '4' appear in the units place?\n\nWell, every 10 numbers, '4' appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one '4', so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), '4' appears once (484). So, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, '8's in units place: same logic, 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place: '4's: 40 from first four hundreds, plus 10 from 440-449, total 50. Correct.\n\n'8's in tens place: 40 from first four hundreds, plus 9 from 480-488, total 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: '4's:89, '8's:0. Correct.\n\nSo, total '4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal '8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. I think I'm confident with that answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more '4's than '8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each block of 10 numbers contributes one '4' and one '8'.\n- There are 48 complete blocks (480 numbers) and 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n- '4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n- '8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 '4's and 10 '8's in the tens place.\n- First four hundreds (1-399): 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 each.\n- 400-488: '4' appears 10 times (440-449), '8' appears 9 times (480-488).\n- '4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n- '8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- '4' appears 89 times (400-488).\n- '8' appears 0 times.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90\n\nSo, there are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, let's see. I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488 and then do the same for the digit 8. Then, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the problem. Page numbers go from 1 to 488, so each page has either one, two, or three digits. I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Maybe I can count the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each place and then add them up.\n\nFirst, let's consider the units place. For each set of ten numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times 4 appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then checking if the last few pages affect the count.\n\nWait, but 488 isn't a multiple of 10. So, the last set of ten would be from 481 to 490, but since the book ends at 488, I need to adjust for that. So, for the units place, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear? Well, every 10 pages, 4 appears once in the units place. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488? That's 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. So, there are 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, the 49th set is from 481 to 490, but we only go up to 488. So, in the 49th set, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once in the units place here as well (at 484). So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times 4 appears in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, let's do the same. Each set of 10 has one 8 in the units place. So, 48 complete sets give 48 times. The 49th set goes up to 488, so in the units place, 8 appears once at 488. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, units place: 49 times for both 4 and 8. So, so far, same count.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many hundreds are there? There are four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-500. But since the book ends at 488, the last hundred is only up to 488. So, let's see:\n\nIn the first hundred (1-100), the tens digit is 4 from 40-49, which is 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, in the second hundred (101-200), the tens digit is 4 from 140-149, another 10 times.\n\nSame for the third hundred (201-300): 240-249, 10 times.\n\nFourth hundred (301-400): 340-349, 10 times.\n\nNow, the fifth hundred would be 401-500, but we only go up to 488. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 times, and then 450-459, 460-469, etc., but wait, no, in 401-488, the tens digit cycles as 0-9. So, from 401-410, tens digit is 0; 411-420, tens digit is 1; ... up to 440-449, tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers, and then 450-459, which is 5 more numbers (since 450-459 is 10 numbers, but wait, 488 is beyond 459. Wait, 488 is in the 400s, so 401-488. So, the tens digit goes up to 8 in 480-488. So, in the 400s, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 times. Then, 450-459: tens digit 5, 460-469: 6, 470-479:7, 480-488:8. So, in the 400s, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, total for 4 in the tens place is 10 (from first hundred) + 10 (second) +10 (third) +10 (fourth) = 40 times.\n\nWait, but the fourth hundred is 301-400, right? So, 340-349 is 10 times. Then, the fifth hundred is 401-500, but we only go up to 488, so 440-449 is another 10 times. So, total 4 in tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 =40.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place. Let's see:\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit is 8 from x80 to x89, which is 10 times per hundred. So, in 1-100: 80-89, 10 times.\n\n101-200: 180-189, 10 times.\n\n201-300: 280-289, 10 times.\n\n301-400: 380-389, 10 times.\n\nNow, 401-488: the tens digit is 8 from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 8 in the tens place appears 9 times here.\n\nSo, total for 8 in the tens place: 10 (first hundred) +10 (second) +10 (third) +10 (fourth) +9 (fifth partial hundred) = 49 times.\n\nWait, so 4 in tens place:40 times, 8 in tens place:49 times. So, so far, 4s:40, 8s:49. Hmm, so 8 is ahead by 9 so far.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. In the hundreds place, each digit appears 100 times per digit. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so it doesn't count. From 100-199, hundreds digit is 1, 200-299:2, 300-399:3, 400-488:4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4s in hundreds place:89, 8s:0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences.\n\nFor 4s:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:40\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4s:49 +40 +89= 178.\n\nFor 8s:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8s:49 +49 +0=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 178 -98=80.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because 80 seems a bit high. Let me go through each step again.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n4s: from 1-488, every 10 pages, 4 appears once in units place. 488/10=48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1, so 48, plus the last partial set from 481-488, where 484 has a 4 in units place, so total 49.\n\nSimilarly for 8s: same logic, 48 full sets, plus 488, so 49.\n\nTens place:\n\n4s: in each hundred, 10 times. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total 50? Wait, wait, no. Wait, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's another 10, making it 50. But earlier, I thought it was 40. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The hundreds are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10. So, 4 times 10=40. Then, in the fifth hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total 40 +10=50.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought 40, but actually it's 50. Hmm, that changes things.\n\nSimilarly, for 8s in the tens place:\n\nIn each of the first four hundreds, 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, 40 +9=49.\n\nSo, 4s in tens place:50, 8s:49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4s: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\n8s: none, since 800-899 isn't included.\n\nSo, total 4s:\n\nUnits:49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. Total=49+50+89=188.\n\n8s:\n\nUnits:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total=98.\n\nSo, difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought 80, but now I'm getting 90. So, where did I go wrong initially?\n\nI think I made a mistake in the tens place for 4s. Initially, I thought 40, but actually, it's 50 because in the 400s, 440-449 is another 10.\n\nSo, the correct total for 4s is 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nFor 8s:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nSo, difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I'm overcounting.\n\nWait, in the units place, 4 appears 49 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4s:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8s:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct now.\n\nBut wait, let me think again about the tens place in the 400s. From 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 50 in total for 4s in tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8s in the tens place in 401-488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times, making total 49.\n\nSo, yes, 50 vs 49 in tens place.\n\nSo, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but the initial thought was 80, but after correcting the count, it's 90.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this differently, using a formula.\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears from 1 to N can be calculated by looking at each digit place separately.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of times = floor(N/10) + (1 if the units digit of N >= d else 0).\n\nFor tens place:\n\nNumber of times = floor(N/100)*10 + (min(max(N%100 - d*10 +1, 0),10) if the tens digit of N >=d else 0).\n\nSimilarly for hundreds place.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to break it down as I did before.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider each digit place:\n\nFor units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many 4s? As calculated, 49.\n\nHow? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, check the last partial cycle: 481-488. The units digits go from 1-8, so 4 appears once (at 484). So, total 49.\n\nSimilarly for 8s: same logic, 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4s:\n\nEach hundred has 10 4s in the tens place. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is another 10. So, total 50.\n\nFor 8s:\n\nEach hundred has 10 8s in the tens place. 4 full hundreds contribute 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. Total 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor 4s:\n\nFrom 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nFor 8s:\n\nNone, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4s:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8s:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is 90 more 4s than 8s.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 80, but after correcting the tens place count, it's 90.\n\nI think that's the right approach. So, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting 4's:**\n   - **Units Place:** Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets (48 occurrences) and one more at 484, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** In each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) contributing 40, plus 10 more in 440-449, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, 4 appears 89 times.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting 8's:**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to 4's, 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** In each hundred, 8 appears 10 times. 4 full hundreds contribute 40, plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 8 doesn't appear as there's no 800-899 range.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should consider how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. The book has 488 pages, so the page numbers go from 1 to 488. That means the page numbers can be 1-digit (1-9), 2-digit (10-99), or 3-digit (100-488). \n\nI think the key here is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers and do the same for the digit 8. Then, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit position separately.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So how many such sets are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each full set, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. So total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for every 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So in each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (40-49, 140-149, etc.). So how many hundreds are there in 488 pages?\n\n488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds and then 88 extra pages. In each full hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so that's 4 times 10, which is 40. Now, in the extra 88 pages (from 400 to 488), the tens digit is 4 in the range 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's another 10. So total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but wait, when we're considering the tens place, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only from 440-449, right? So that's 10 numbers. So 4 full hundreds give 4*10=40, plus 10 from the 440-449, totaling 50. That seems right.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but wait, the hundreds digit is only 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So total 4's printed are 187.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll count how many times 8 appears in each position.\n\nStarting with the units place: Just like with 4, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many full sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once in the units place (488). So total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: For every 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So in each hundred, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So how many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, ..., 401-500, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last hundred is 401-500, but we only go up to 488). Wait, maybe I should think differently.\n\nWait, 488 is less than 500, so the hundreds are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488. So that's 5 groups, but the last group is only up to 488.\n\nIn each full hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), so that's 4 full hundreds contributing 4*10=40. Now, in the last group, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, so that's 9 times. So total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480, 481, ..., 488. So yes, 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So that's 9. So total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So the hundreds place contributes 0 8's.\n\nSo total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me double-check the tens place. Because in the 401-488 group, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So that's correct.\n\nSo total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, for 4's, I had 187, and for 8's, 98. So the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 4's. That seems correct.\n\nFor the units place of 4's: 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48. Plus in the last partial set (481-488), units digits go from 1-8, so no 4 there. So 48 units 4's.\n\nTens place for 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So in each hundred, 10 4's in the tens place. So 4 hundreds (1-400) would be 4*10=40, plus in 400-488, 440-449 is another 10, so total 50. That's correct.\n\nSo 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187 4's.\n\nFor 8's: Units place: 48 full sets, 48 8's, plus 488 has an 8 in units, so 49.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds, each with 10 8's in the tens place, so 40, plus in 401-488, 480-488 has 9 8's in the tens place, so 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0, since 800-899 isn't included.\n\nSo total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nTherefore, 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe I missed something in the counting. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor the units digit:\n\n- For 4: As before, 488 // 10 = 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, 488 % 10 = 8, so the last partial cycle is 1-8, which doesn't include 4, so total 48.\n\n- For 8: 488 // 10 = 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, so 48. The last partial cycle (481-488) includes 8, so that's 49.\n\nSo units: 48 for 4, 49 for 8.\n\nTens digit:\n\n- For 4: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So 488 // 100 = 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 4's, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n- For 8: Similarly, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. 4 full hundreds contribute 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds digit:\n\n- For 4: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\n- For 8: From 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if I should include page numbers beyond 488, but no, the book only has 488 pages, so 488 is the last page. So I think my counts are correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8 again. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So that's 9 8's in the tens place in that range. So 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, yes, I think the difference is 89. So there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me try to think if there's another way to approach this, maybe using a formula or something.\n\nI remember that for digit counting problems, you can use a formula where you calculate the number of times a digit appears in each position by considering higher digits, current digit, and lower digits.\n\nThe formula is something like:\n\nFor each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times the digit appears based on higher digits, current digit, and lower digits.\n\nBut maybe that's more complicated. Let me see if I can apply it here.\n\nLet's take the units place first.\n\nFor digit 4 in units place:\n\nThe number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10, which is floor(488 / 10) = 48, plus if the remainder is >=4, add 1. But since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so 48 +1=49? Wait, no, that's for 4's in units place. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, maybe I'm confused.\n\nWait, no, actually, when counting how many times a digit appears in the units place, the formula is:\n\ncount = higher * 10^lower_digits + if current > target_digit, add 1, else if current == target_digit, add (lower_digits +1).\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to apply it.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to stick with my initial approach since it gave me a consistent result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write out the counts for smaller numbers to see if the pattern holds.\n\nFor example, in a 10-page book, how many 4's and 8's?\n\nPages 1-10.\n\n4's: page 4 \u2192 1.\n\n8's: page 8 \u21921.\n\nDifference: 0.\n\nIn a 20-page book:\n\n4's: 4,14 \u21922.\n\n8's:8,18 \u21922.\n\nDifference:0.\n\nIn a 30-page book:\n\n4's:4,14,24 \u21923.\n\n8's:8,18,28 \u21923.\n\nDifference:0.\n\nWait, but in a 40-page book:\n\n4's:4,14,24,34,40-49, but wait, up to 40, so 4,14,24,34 \u21924.\n\n8's:8,18,28,38 \u21924.\n\nBut wait, 40 is the last page, so 40's units digit is 0, so 4's in units place are 4,14,24,34, and in tens place, 40-49, but since we only go up to 40, the tens digit is 4 for 40, which is one more. So total 4's: 4 (units) +1 (tens) =5.\n\n8's:8,18,28,38 \u21924.\n\nSo difference is 5-4=1.\n\nWait, so in a 40-page book, 4's are 5 and 8's are 4, so difference is 1.\n\nWait, but in my initial method, for 40 pages:\n\nUnits place 4's: floor(40/10)=4, since 40 mod 10 is 0, which is less than 4, so 4 times.\n\nTens place 4's: floor(40/100)=0, plus if current digit >=4, add 10^(number of lower digits). Wait, maybe this is getting too confusing.\n\nI think my initial approach was correct, but I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 4's. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, since the book ends at 488, there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo I think my initial calculation stands: 187 4's and 98 8's, difference of 89.\n\nWait, but let me check the total number of digits printed. Wait, maybe that's not necessary, but just to make sure.\n\nWait, 488 pages, each page has a number from 1 to 488.\n\nNumber of digits:\n\n- Pages 1-9: 9 pages, 1 digit each \u21929 digits.\n\n- Pages 10-99: 90 pages, 2 digits each \u2192180 digits.\n\n- Pages 100-488: 389 pages, 3 digits each \u21921167 digits.\n\nTotal digits: 9 + 180 + 1167 = 1356 digits.\n\nNow, total number of 4's:187, total number of 8's:98.\n\nSo 187 +98=285 digits accounted for. That leaves 1356 -285=1071 digits unaccounted for, which seems plausible.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if 187 and 98 are correct by another method.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write a small program or use a formula to calculate the number of times each digit appears.\n\nWait, I found a formula online before, which is:\n\nFor a given digit d and position p (units=1, tens=2, hundreds=3, etc.), the number of times d appears in position p is:\n\ncount = higher * 10^(p-1) + if current > d, add 10^(p-1), else if current == d, add (lower +1).\n\nWhere higher is the number formed by digits higher than the current position, current is the digit at position p, and lower is the number formed by digits lower than the current position.\n\nLet me try applying this to the units place for digit 4.\n\nFor units place (p=1):\n\nhigher = 48 (since 488 //10 =48, which is higher part).\n\ncurrent = 488 %10 =8.\n\nlower = 0.\n\nSo count = higher *10^(1-1) + if current >4, add 10^(1-1), else if current ==4, add (lower +1).\n\nSo higher is 48, 10^0=1.\n\ncurrent is 8, which is >4, so add 1.\n\nSo count =48*1 +1=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, that's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, so according to this formula, units place 4's are 49, but earlier I thought it was 48.\n\nWait, that suggests I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let's think. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEach 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. But in the last partial ten (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, which includes 484, so that's another 4 in the units place. So total 48 +1=49.\n\nAh, so I think I made a mistake earlier by not considering that 484 is included in the last partial set. So units place 4's are 49, not 48.\n\nWait, that changes things.\n\nSimilarly, let's recalculate for 4's.\n\nUnits place:49.\n\nTens place: Let's apply the formula.\n\np=2 (tens place).\n\nhigher =488 //100=4.\n\ncurrent=(488 //10) %10=8.\n\nlower=488 %10=8.\n\nSo count=higher *10^(2-1) + if current >4, add 10^(2-1), else if current==4, add (lower +1).\n\nSo higher=4, 10^1=10.\n\ncurrent=8>4, so add 10.\n\nSo count=4*10 +10=50.\n\nSo 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place:\n\np=3.\n\nhigher=488 //1000=0.\n\ncurrent=(488 //100)%10=4.\n\nlower=488 %100=88.\n\nSo count=higher*10^(3-1) + if current>4, add 10^(3-1), else if current==4, add (lower +1).\n\nhigher=0, 10^2=100.\n\ncurrent=4, so add (lower +1)=88+1=89.\n\nSo count=0 +89=89.\n\nSo total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was 187, but now it's 188. So I must have made a mistake earlier in the units place.\n\nWait, so using the formula, units place 4's are 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits place:\n\np=1.\n\nhigher=488//10=48.\n\ncurrent=488%10=8.\n\nlower=0.\n\nSo count=48*1 + (since current=8>8? No, current=8, which is equal to 8, so add (lower +1)=0+1=1.\n\nSo count=48 +1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\np=2.\n\nhigher=488//100=4.\n\ncurrent=(488//10)%10=8.\n\nlower=488%10=8.\n\nSo count=4*10 + (since current=8>8? No, equal, so add (lower +1)=8+1=9.\n\nSo count=40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\np=3.\n\nhigher=488//1000=0.\n\ncurrent=(488//100)%10=4.\n\nlower=488%100=88.\n\nSince current=4 <8, we don't add anything beyond higher*10^(3-1)=0*100=0.\n\nSo count=0.\n\nThus, total 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nSo now, total 4's:188, total 8's:98.\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought 4's were 187, but using the formula, it's 188. So I must have missed a 4 in the units place earlier.\n\nSo the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with the formula.\n\nWait, in the units place for 4's, the formula gave 49, which includes the 484, which is correct.\n\nIn the tens place, 50, which is correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 89, correct.\n\nSo total 4's:188.\n\n8's:98.\n\nDifference:90.\n\nSo I think the correct answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI must have made a mistake earlier by not counting the 484 in the units place, thinking the last partial set didn't include a 4, but it does because 484 is within 481-488.\n\nSo the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check again.\n\nWait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48. Then, in the last partial ten (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484). So 48 +1=49 units 4's.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place:48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus 488, which is another 8, so 49.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nIn the tens place for 4's: Each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 full hundreds (1-400) contribute 4*10=40, plus in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10. So total 50.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place: Each hundred contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 full hundreds contribute 4*10=40, plus in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So total 49.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nHundreds place for 8's: 0.\n\nSo total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct now. So the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should figure out how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488, and then do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the digits separately\u2014units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Maybe I can count how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place**: Every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4. That gives 48 fours. But wait, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more in 484. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place**: Every 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49, 140-149, etc.). How many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, the last partial hundred is 401-488. In the tens place, 40-49 would be 40-49, but wait, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8, so the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449. That's 10 more fours. So total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nAdding them up: Units (49) + Tens (50) + Hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So 4's appear 188 times.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Hmm, for the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each having a hundreds digit of 4. So that's correct.\n\nNow, for the digit 8:\n\n1. **Units place**: Similar to 4, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. From 1 to 488, that's 48 complete groups of 10, giving 48 eights. In the last partial group, 481-488, the units digit goes up to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place**: Every 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are 4 full hundreds, so 4*10=40. In the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So that's 9 more eights. So total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? So 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers, each with tens digit 8. So yes, 9 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The hundreds digit is 8 only from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no hundreds digits of 8. So hundreds place 8's are 0.\n\nAdding them up: Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So 8's appear 98 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought in the tens place for 8's, the last partial hundred (401-488) gives 9 eights, so 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo total 4's: 188, and 8's: 98. The difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. So there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 48 full tens (1-480), each contributing 1, so 48. Then 484 in 481-488, so 1 more. Total 49.\n\n- Tens: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. Total 50.\n\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 48 full tens, 48. Then 488, so 1 more. Total 49.\n\n- Tens: 4 full hundreds, 40. Then in 401-488, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. Total 49.\n\n- Hundreds: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears is calculated by considering each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately, summing up their occurrences, and then doing the same for the digit 8. After calculating the total occurrences for both digits, the difference is found to be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers contribute one 4. There are 48 complete groups (1-480), giving 48 fours. The last group (481-488) includes 484, adding one more. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** Every 100 numbers contribute 10 fours (e.g., 40-49). Four full hundreds give 40 fours. The last partial hundred (401-488) includes 440-449, adding 10 more. Total: 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, each number has a hundreds digit of 4, totaling 89 numbers. Total: 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to 4, 48 groups of 10 give 48 eights. The last group includes 488, adding one more. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** Four full hundreds give 40 eights. The last partial hundred (401-488) includes 480-488, adding 9 more. Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No hundreds digit is 8 in the range. Total: 0.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should consider how page numbers are structured. Each page number is a number from 1 to 488, and each digit in these numbers can be a 0-9. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by thinking about how digits are distributed in numbers. For example, in a 1-digit number, it's just the number itself. For 2-digit numbers, each digit (tens and units place) can vary. Similarly, for 3-digit numbers, there are hundreds, tens, and units places. Since 488 is a 3-digit number, I'll need to consider all three places.\n\nI think I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. For each place, I'll calculate how many times 4 appears and how many times 8 appears, then sum them up for all places.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 cycles every 10 numbers. So in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, 4 appears once and 8 appears once.\n\nBut wait, the first page is 1, so the first block is 1-10, which has units digits 1-0. Then 11-20, units digits 1-0 again, and so on. So how many such blocks are there up to 488?\n\nWait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks of 10, and then a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). So in each full block, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So for 48 full blocks, that's 48 times each. Then in the partial block, which is 481-488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So in units place, 4 and 8 appear the same number of times.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So maybe the difference comes from the tens and hundreds places.\n\nNow moving on to the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, each digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So in the tens place, each digit appears 10 times in each hundred. So for 488 pages, how many hundreds are there?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial hundred from 401-488.\n\nIn each full hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So for each full hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8. So for 4 full hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, the partial hundred from 401-488. Let's see, how does the tens digit behave here? From 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490, but since we stop at 488, it's 481-488). Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the tens digit in 481-488 is 8, right? So in 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, but let's count how many times each digit appears.\n\nWait, let me think again. From 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0 (10 numbers)\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1 (10 numbers)\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2 (10 numbers)\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3 (10 numbers)\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4 (10 numbers)\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5 (10 numbers)\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6 (10 numbers)\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7 (10 numbers)\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8 (8 numbers)\n\nWait, so in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8, but the last one only has 8 numbers. So for the tens digit, how many times does 4 appear? It's in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. How about 8? It's in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times.\n\nSo in the tens place for the partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo total for tens place:\n\n4's: 4 full hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 10 in the partial hundred, so 50.\n\n8's: 4 full hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 8 in the partial hundred, so 48.\n\nSo in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 48 times. So the difference here is 50 - 48 = 2 more 4's than 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, each digit represents a hundred. So for numbers 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, but since we're starting from 1, maybe we can ignore that as 0 doesn't count. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, 200-299 is 2, 300-399 is 3, and 400-488 is 4.\n\nSo how many times does each hundreds digit appear?\n\n- 1 appears 100 times (100-199)\n- 2 appears 100 times (200-299)\n- 3 appears 100 times (300-399)\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488, which is 89 numbers: 400 is the first, 488 is the last, so 488 - 400 + 1 = 89)\n\nWait, let me check that: 488 - 400 = 88, so 88 + 1 = 89. So 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 never appears in the hundreds place because 800-899 would be beyond 488. So 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo in the hundreds place, 4's count is 89, and 8's count is 0.\n\nSo now, let's sum up the counts for each place:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 48\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nSo the difference is 188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEach 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So total blocks of 10: 48 full blocks (1-480), and then 481-488, which is 8 numbers.\n\nIn each full block, 4 appears once, so 48 times. In the last partial block, 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484). So total 49 times for units place.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears once in each full block (48 times) and once in the partial block (488), so 49 times.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach full hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So 4 full hundreds give 4*10=40 for 4's and 40 for 8's.\n\nIn the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 441-450 (10 times) and 8 in 481-488 (8 times). So 4's: 10, 8's:8.\n\nTotal tens place: 4's: 40+10=50, 8's:40+8=48.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. 8 never appears in hundreds place here.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nWait, but I feel like maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me check again.\n\nIn the hundreds place, from 400-488, how many numbers is that? It's 488 - 400 +1=89. So yes, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nAnd for 8's, since 800 is beyond 488, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all, so 0.\n\nSo the total 4's are 188, 8's are 97, difference is 91.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I should include page 488 as 488, so the hundreds digit is 4, which is correct.\n\nWait another thought: when I was counting the units place, I considered 488 as the last page, so the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included. So 484 is included as well.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count any digits.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this by looking at each digit place separately and calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a formula for each digit place.\n\nIn general, for a given digit place (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times a digit d appears can be calculated using a formula based on higher, current, and lower digits.\n\nBut maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, let me try to count each digit place again.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nTotal numbers:488.\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in units place:\n\nNumber of complete decades (groups of 10):488//10=48, with remainder 8.\n\nIn each complete decade, 4 appears once in the units place, so 48 times.\n\nIn the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484).\n\nTotal units 4's:48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, units 8's:48 complete decades, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus in the remaining 8 numbers, 8 appears once (488). So total 49.\n\nSo units place:4's=49,8's=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in tens place:\n\nEach hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So for each hundred, 10 times.\n\nNumber of complete hundreds:488//100=4, with remainder 88.\n\nSo in 4 complete hundreds, 4*10=40 times.\n\nIn the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nLooking at 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8.\n\nThe tens digit is 4 in the range 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So 10 times.\n\nSo total tens 4's:40+10=50.\n\nSimilarly, number of times 8 appears in tens place:\n\nIn each complete hundred, 10 times. So 4*10=40.\n\nIn the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480-488, but wait, 480 is included? Wait, 480 is part of 480-489, but we only go up to 488. So 480-488 is 9 numbers (including 480). Wait, but 480 is 480, which is within 401-488? Wait, 401-488 includes 480, yes.\n\nWait, but 480 is 480, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So 9 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 8 numbers, but now I'm thinking 9. Wait, let me check: 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So 9 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 481-488 was 8 numbers, but that's when the hundreds digit is 4 and the tens digit is 8, but 480 is also part of the remaining 88 numbers after 400. So in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 481-488 was 8 numbers, but that's only the units digits from 1-8, but 480 is included in 401-488, so it's 9 numbers.\n\nWait, but 480 is 480, which is part of 401-488, so yes, it's included. So the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo in the tens place, 8's:40 (from complete hundreds) +9=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 8, but now I'm getting 9. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let's clarify: from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So 9 times.\n\nSo in the tens place, 8's:40+9=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought in the partial hundred, 8's appeared 8 times, but now I'm getting 9. So I think I made a mistake earlier.\n\nSo let me correct that:\n\nIn the tens place:\n\n4's:50 (40 from complete hundreds, 10 from 440-449)\n\n8's:40 from complete hundreds, plus 9 from 480-488, so 49.\n\nWait, but that would mean that in the tens place, 4's=50 and 8's=49, so 4's are 1 more than 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 8's in the tens place were 48, but that was a mistake. It should be 49.\n\nSo now, let's recalculate:\n\nTotal 4's:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:50\n\nHundreds:89\n\nTotal:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:49\n\nHundreds:0\n\nTotal:49+49+0=98\n\nSo difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought 8's in tens place were 48, but now I think it's 49, leading to a difference of 90 instead of 91.\n\nWait, I'm confused now. Let me double-check.\n\nIn the tens place, for the partial hundred (401-488):\n\n- 480-488: tens digit is 8, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So 9 times.\n\nSo 8's in tens place:40 (from complete hundreds) +9=49.\n\nSimilarly, 4's in tens place:40 (from complete hundreds) +10 (from 440-449)=50.\n\nSo units:4's=49,8's=49\n\nTens:4's=50,8's=49\n\nHundreds:4's=89,8's=0\n\nSo total 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo the difference is 90.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought 8's in tens place were 48, but that was wrong; it's 49.\n\nSo the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check again: in 401-488, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place?\n\nIt's from 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So that's 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo 8's in tens place:40+9=49.\n\nSimilarly, 4's in tens place:40+10=50.\n\nSo 4's:50, 8's:49 in tens place.\n\nSo total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I'm counting correctly in the hundreds place. Let me confirm.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so 800-899 isn't included. So 8's in hundreds place:0.\n\nSo yes, 89 for 4's, 0 for 8's.\n\nSo total 4's:188, 8's:98, difference:90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the difference was 91, but after correcting the tens place count, it's 90.\n\nLet me try another approach: perhaps using a formula for each digit place.\n\nIn the units place, the count for digit d is:\n\ncount = (n // 10) * 1 + min(max(n % 10 - d + 1, 0), 10)\n\nWait, maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, for units place, the number of times 4 appears is floor(488/10) + 1 if 4 is <= (488 % 10). Wait, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, for each digit place, the formula is:\n\nhigher = number formed by digits higher than current\ncurrent = current digit\nlower = number formed by digits lower than current\n\ncount = higher * 10^(digits to the right)\nif current > d: count += 10^digits\nif current == d: count += (lower + 1)\n\nBut maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to stick with the initial method.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in the tens place earlier. Let me recount.\n\nIn the tens place, for the partial hundred (401-488), how many times does 8 appear?\n\nIt's when the tens digit is 8, which is from 480-488. So that's 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488.\n\nSo 9 times.\n\nSo 8's in tens place:40 (from complete hundreds) +9=49.\n\nSimilarly, 4's in tens place:40 (from complete hundreds) +10 (from 440-449)=50.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nSo total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo the correct answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure because I think I might have miscounted somewhere.\n\nLet me try to count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place again.\n\nUnits place:\n\n4's:49, 8's:49\n\nTens place:\n\n4's:50, 8's:49\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's:89, 8's:0\n\nSo total 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 8's in the tens place were 48, but now I'm getting 49. So perhaps the correct answer is 90.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that in the partial hundred, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times 8 in the tens place.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct difference is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I initially thought it was 91, but after correcting, it's 90.\n\nI think I should stick with 90 as the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total complete decades: 48 (1-480), each contributing one 4 and one 8.\n   - Partial decade (481-488): 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in each hundred.\n   - Complete hundreds (1-400): 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's.\n     - Total 4's: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n     - Total 8's: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Partial hundred (401-488):\n     - 4 appears 10 times (440-449).\n     - 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488: 89 times.\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89.\n   - Total 8's: 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should figure out how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488, and then do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. Hmm, sounds logical.\n\nLet me start by considering how digits are arranged in page numbers. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 up to 488. So, the page numbers can be 1-digit (1-9), 2-digit (10-99), and 3-digit (100-488).\n\nI think I should calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That might make it easier to sum them up.\n\nLet's start with the digit 4.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - In the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 10, 4 appears once (at 4). From 11 to 20, it appears once (at 14), and so on.\n   - Since the book has 488 pages, the number of complete groups of 10 is 48 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups). Each group contributes one 4 in the units place.\n   - So, 48 * 1 = 48 times in the units place.\n   - But wait, after 480, we have 481 to 488, which is 8 more numbers. In this last incomplete group, the units digit cycles from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. So, no additional 4's in the units place beyond the 48 we've already counted.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, this happens in every hundred, like 140-149, 240-249, etc.\n   - How many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n   - From 1-488, the hundreds go from 0 to 4 (since 488 is in the 400s). So, there are 5 hundreds (0-4). But wait, the first hundred (1-99) doesn't have a 4 in the tens place until 40-49. So, let's see:\n     - In the 0-99 range: 40-49 is 10 numbers where tens digit is 4.\n     - In the 100-199 range: 140-149 is another 10.\n     - Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449 each contribute 10.\n   - So, how many hundreds? Let me think. From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, that's 5 ranges. But the last range (400-488) only goes up to 488, so the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is a full 10 numbers, and then from 450-488, the tens digit doesn't reach 4 again because 488 is less than 490. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 appears only once in 440-449.\n   - So, total tens places with 4:\n     - 0-99: 10\n     - 100-199: 10\n     - 200-299: 10\n     - 300-399: 10\n     - 400-488: 10 (from 440-449)\n     - Wait, but 488 is in the 400s, so 440-449 is within 400-488. So, that's 5 blocks each contributing 10, so 5*10=50.\n   - Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so the 400-488 range is only 88 pages, but the tens digit 4 in 440-449 is still 10 numbers. So, total tens digit 4's: 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488.\n   - How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 times.\n\nNow, adding up the 4's:\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, no, in the units place, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4. So, 48 times. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, each hundred has a 40-49 block, which is 10 numbers. So, from 0-99: 10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488: 10 (440-449). So, 5 blocks, each 10, so 50. That seems right.\n\nIn the hundreds place, only from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. So, total 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Hmm, okay.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, in the units place, 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8. So, 48 times.\n   - The last group is 481-488, which includes 488, so the units digit 8 appears once more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, let me think again. From 1 to 488, the number of units digits is 488. Each 10 numbers contribute one 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. But the last partial group is 481-488, which includes 488, so the units digit 8 appears once more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In the tens place, 8 appears in the block 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each hundred has one such block, contributing 10 times.\n   - From 0-99: 80-89: 10\n   - 100-199: 180-189: 10\n   - 200-299: 280-289: 10\n   - 300-399: 380-389: 10\n   - 400-488: 480-488: here, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 times.\n\nWait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9.\n\nSo, in the tens place:\n- 0-99: 10\n- 100-199:10\n- 200-299:10\n- 300-399:10\n- 400-488:9\nTotal: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up the 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me check.\n\nWait, in the tens place, for 400-488, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nUnits place: 49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. So, total 8's: 98.\n\nNow, comparing the number of 4's and 8's:\n\nNumber of 4's: 187\nNumber of 8's: 98\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, when I calculated the 4's, in the hundreds place, I had 89, which seems correct because from 400-488, that's 89 numbers where the hundreds digit is 4. Then, tens place 50 and units place 48, totaling 187.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 49, tens place:49, so 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the units place for 8's. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n\nSo, the number of times is equal to the number of times 8 appears in the units place, which is floor(488/10) = 48 times, plus 1 if the last number is 488, which it is. So, 48 +1=49. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except for the last hundred (400-488), which only has 9. So, 4 hundreds with 10 each, and one with 9, so 4*10 +9=49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98.\n\n4's: 48 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=187.\n\nSo, difference: 187-98=89.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly for 4's. From 400-488, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89 times the hundreds digit is 4. That's correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place for 4's, I had 5 blocks each contributing 10, so 50. That seems correct because from 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488, each has a 40-49 block, except that in 400-488, the 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks, each 10, so 50.\n\nUnits place: 48, correct.\n\nSo, 48+50+89=187.\n\n8's: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 187-98=89.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place for 4's, I had 5 blocks, each 10, so 50. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place for 8's, I had 49. That seems correct as well.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is calculated by considering each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately:\n\n- **Units place:** 48 times\n- **Tens place:** 50 times\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 times\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n\n- **Units place:** 49 times\n- **Tens place:** 49 times\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 times\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488, and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense because the question is asking how many more 4's there are than 8's.\n\nLet me break it down by each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. I remember that in problems like these, it's helpful to consider each digit position separately because the frequency of digits can vary depending on their place.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for the digit 8. So, for the units place, the number of 4's and 8's should be the same, right? But wait, I need to check if 488 affects this because it's the last page.\n\nWait, no, the units digit cycles every 10, so from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Let me see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. So, in each complete group of 10, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 groups would give 48 4's and 48 8's in the units place. Then, the remaining 8 numbers are from 481 to 488. Looking at the units digits here: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So, in these, there's one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488). So, units place contributes 49 4's and 49 8's. Wait, that's not correct because 488 is included, so maybe I should count it as 48 complete groups and then 8 extra. Wait, 488 is the last page, so from 1 to 488, that's 488 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning 48 full groups of 10 and 8 extra numbers. So, in each group, one 4 and one 8 in units place, so 48 each. Then, in the extra 8 numbers, which are 481 to 488, the units digits are 1-8. So, 484 has a 4, and 488 has an 8. So, that's one more 4 and one more 8. So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 4's and 48 + 1 = 49 8's. So, in units place, they are equal.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place within each hundred. So, for example, from 0-99, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in 80-89, 10 times. So, for each hundred, 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488? Let's see, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nSo, for each complete hundred, the tens place contributes 10 4's and 10 8's. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10 = 40 4's and 4*10 = 40 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the remaining pages are from 401 to 488. Let's look at the tens digit here. From 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-488). So, we need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place in this range.\n\nWait, but 401-488 is 88 pages. Let me break it down:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nSo, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears once in 441-450, which is 10 times (441 to 450). Similarly, the digit 8 appears once in 481-490, but wait, our range ends at 488, so from 481-488, the tens digit is 8, but there are only 8 numbers (481-488), so the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place here? It's 8 times, right? Because each of those 8 numbers has an 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, no, wait. The tens digit is 8 for all numbers from 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 for each of these 8 numbers, so that's 8 times.\n\nWait, but earlier, for each hundred, we had 10 times each digit in the tens place, but here, in the last partial hundred, we have 10 times for 4 (441-450) and 8 times for 8 (481-488). So, in the tens place, in the remaining 88 pages, we have 10 4's and 8 8's.\n\nSo, total in the tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 = 50 4's, and 40 (from complete hundreds) + 8 = 48 8's.\n\nWait, so in the tens place, 4's: 50, 8's: 48. So, 4's are more by 2 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 in 100-199, 2 in 200-299, 3 in 300-399, and 4 in 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, 89 times.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, because 800 would be page 800, which is beyond 488. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's: 89, 8's: 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the digits.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, in the units place, I thought 488 has 48 complete groups of 10, giving 48 4's and 48 8's, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488) with one 4 and one 8, making it 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for each complete hundred, 10 4's and 10 8's. So, 4 hundreds give 40 each. Then, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 441-450 (10 times) and 8 in 481-488 (8 times). So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 8 = 48 for 8's. That seems right.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times (from 400-488), and 8 doesn't appear at all. So, 89 for 4's, 0 for 8's.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. When I have 488 pages, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEach 10 numbers have one 4. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, the remaining 8 numbers are 481-488, which includes 484, so that's one more 4. So, total 49 4's in units place. Same for 8's: 488 /10 = 48, plus 488 itself, which is an 8, so 49 8's in units place. So, that's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. And 8 in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 8's. So, that adds 10 to 4's and 8 to 8's in the tens place. So, 40 +10=50 for 4's, 40+8=48 for 8's.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4's: 89, 8's:0.\n\nSo, 4's total: 49 +50+89=188, 8's:49+48+0=97. Difference:188-97=91.\n\nI think that's correct. So, there are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that in the tens place, I might have miscounted the number of 8's? Because in 481-488, the tens digit is 8 for all 8 numbers, so that's 8 times. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, another way to check: total number of digits printed from 1 to 488.\n\nBut maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\n\nTotal 4's: 188\nTotal 8's:97\nDifference:91\n\nSo, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 4's. Correct.\n\nAnd no 8's in hundreds place because 800 is beyond 488. So, 0 8's in hundreds place.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think I'm confident that the difference is 91.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each group of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n- There are 48 complete groups (480 numbers), giving 48 of each.\n- The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n- Total: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n- Four complete hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 each.\n- The remaining 88 numbers (401-488) contribute 10 4's (441-450) and 8 8's (481-488).\n- Total: 50 4's and 48 8's.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, contributing 89 4's.\n- No 8's appear in the hundreds place.\n- Total: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{91}."

    "text": " Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should consider how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number, right? So, from page 1 to page 9, it's one digit, then from 10 to 99, it's two digits, and from 100 onwards, it's three digits up to 488.\n\nI guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Because the digits can appear in any of these positions, I should count them in each position and then add them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For each group of ten pages, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. Similarly, the digit 8 also appears once in the units place per group of ten.\n\nNow, how many complete groups of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups and then 8 more pages. So, in each of these 48 groups, the units digit 4 and 8 each appear once. That gives 48 times for each digit in the units place.\n\nBut wait, in the last group, which is pages 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, does 4 appear once? Yes, at page 484, and 8 appears once at page 488. So, that adds one more each for units place in 4 and 8. So, total in units place: 48 (from complete groups) + 1 (from the last partial group) = 49 times for 4, and similarly 49 times for 8.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the last group, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, the units place count for 4 is 48 (from 48 groups) +1=49, and same for 8: 48+1=49. So, in units place, both digits appear 49 times each.\n\nWait, but hold on, the first group is 1-10, so 10 is included. So, when I count 48 groups, that's 1-480, right? Because 48 groups times 10 pages each is 480 pages. Then, the last 8 pages are 481-488.\n\nSo, in the units place, from 1-480, each digit 4 and 8 appears 48 times each. Then, in 481-488, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, units place total: 48+1=49 for 4, and 48+1=49 for 8. So, same count in units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, in each block of 100 pages, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, for the digit 4 in the tens place, in each 100 pages, it appears 10 times: 40-49, 140-149, etc. Similarly, for 8, it's 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n\nNow, how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 400 pages would be four complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Then, we have 88 pages left: 401-488.\n\nSo, in each of the four hundreds, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 4 times 10 = 40 times for 4 in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times per hundred, so 4 times 10 = 40 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, we need to check how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nLooking at 401-488, the tens digit can be 0 (for 401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-490). But since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit 8 would be from 481-488, which is 8 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of these, so that's 8 times? Wait, no, in the tens place, each group is 10 pages. So, from 480-489, the tens digit is 8, but we only go up to 488, which is 9 pages (480-488). Wait, but 480 is included in the previous hundreds, right? Because 400-499 is the fifth hundred, but we only go up to 488.\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me think again.\n\nIn the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-489). But since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit 8 would be from 480-488, which is 9 pages (480, 481,...,488). So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here.\n\nBut wait, 480 is part of the 401-488 range. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in 480-488.\n\nSimilarly, does the digit 4 appear in the tens place in 401-488? Let's see: the tens digit 4 would be in 440-449. So, that's 10 pages: 440,441,...,449. But since we're only going up to 488, 440-449 is entirely within 401-488, so that's 10 times.\n\nSo, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nTherefore, total for tens place:\n\n- Digit 4: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 10 in the last partial hundred, so 50 times.\n\n- Digit 8: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 9 in the last partial hundred, so 49 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards, up to page 488. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's 0. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place?\n\n- Digit 4: From 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n\n- Digit 8: Now, does 8 ever appear in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the highest page is 488, so the hundreds digit can only go up to 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, digit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, that's correct, right? Because the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, and before that, it's 3, 2, 1, and 0. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total for hundreds place:\n\n- Digit 4: 89 times.\n\n- Digit 8: 0 times.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nStarting with digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49 times.\n\n- Tens place: 50 times.\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 times.\n\nTotal for 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nNow, for digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times.\n\n- Tens place: 49 times.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nTotal for 8: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- Each 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once in units place.\n\n- 488 pages means 48 full groups of 10 (480 pages) and 8 extra pages.\n\n- So, units place: 48 +1 for 4, and 48 +1 for 8, so 49 each.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each 100 pages, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in tens place.\n\n- There are 4 full hundreds (1-400), so 4*10=40 each.\n\n- Then, in 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, 4: 40+10=50, 8:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n\n- 8 appears 0 times.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 =98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me just think again if I missed anything. Maybe in the tens place for 8 in the last partial hundred, I considered 9 times, but is that correct?\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So, yes, 9 times. So, 40 (from full hundreds) +9=49 for 8 in tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for 4 in the last partial hundred, 440-449 is 10 pages, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, which is correct.\n\nHmm, I think my calculations are correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe by counting the number of 4's and 8's in each position again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write a small table for each digit place.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nDigit 4:\n\n- Units place: in each 10 pages, 4 appears once. So, total groups of 10 in 488 pages: floor(488/10)=48 groups, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit is 1-8, so 4 appears once. So, total units:48+1=49.\n\n- Tens place: in each 100 pages, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 from 1-400. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, total tens:40+10=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nDigit 8:\n\n- Units place: same as 4, each 10 pages, once. So, 48 groups, 48 times, plus in the last 8 pages, 8 appears once at 488. So, 48+1=49.\n\n- Tens place: in each 100 pages, 10 times. So, 4*10=40. In 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages (since 480 is included, 480-488 is 9 pages). So, 40+9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I think about 401-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so maybe I should check if that affects the tens place counts. But no, the tens place is separate. So, in 401-488, the tens digit can be 0-8, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place, as I thought.\n\nAnother way to check: maybe list out the counts for each digit in each position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write a small program or use a formula to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nBut since I can't write a program here, I'll just rely on my manual calculation.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n- Units place: 49 for 4, 49 for 8.\n\n- Tens place:50 for 4,49 for 8.\n\n- Hundreds place:89 for 4,0 for 8.\n\nAdding up, 4's:49+50+89=188, 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, and hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - There are 48 complete groups of 10 pages (1-480), giving 48 occurrences each for 4 and 8.\n   - In the remaining 8 pages (481-488), 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n   - **Total:** 49 for both 4 and 8.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - In the first 400 pages (4 hundreds), each digit appears 40 times.\n   - In 401-488:\n     - 4 appears 10 times (440-449).\n     - 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - **Total:** 50 for 4, 49 for 8.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total:** 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\nThus, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should consider how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the first page is 1, then 2, all the way up to 488. \n\nI guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Maybe I can calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each place and then add them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. \n\nSo, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra pages. \n\nIn each complete set of 10, the units digit 4 appears once and the same for 8. So, for 48 sets, the number of 4's in the units place would be 48, and the same for 8's. \n\nNow, the remaining 8 pages are from 481 to 488. Let me check the units digits here: 481 ends with 1, 482 with 2, up to 488 ending with 8. So, in these 8 pages, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the units digit 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). \n\nSo, total units place 4's: 48 (from the complete sets) + 1 (from the remaining pages) = 49. Similarly, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, 4 and 8 appear the same number of times. \n\nWait, but that can't be right because 488 is included, so maybe I should check again. Let me recount. \n\nWait, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so pages 1 to 480 have 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Then, pages 481 to 488: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, yes, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 49 each. So, no difference there.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each cycle of 100 has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, from 1-100, the tens digits go from 0 (for 1-9) up to 9 (for 90-99). So, in each hundred, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Actually, each hundred is 100 pages, so 488 pages would have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each full hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for each hundred, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times in the tens place. \n\nSince there are 4 full hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 occurrences of 4 in the tens place and 40 for 8 as well. \n\nNow, the remaining 88 pages: 401-488. Let's see how the tens digit behaves here. \n\nFrom 401 to 488, the tens digits go through 0-9 in each set of 10 pages. So, let's break it down:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 481-488 is 8 pages. So, the tens digit in 481-488 is 8, but only for 8 pages, not 10.\n\nSo, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Looking at 441-450, the tens digit is 4. That's 10 pages, so 10 times. \n\nHow about 8? In the range 481-488, the tens digit is 8, but only for 8 pages, so 8 times. \n\nWait, but 481-488 is 8 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? So, that's 8 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. \n\nSo, in the tens place, for the remaining 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nAdding that to the 40 from the full hundreds, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 48 times. So, 4 appears 2 more times than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only non-zero from page 100 onwards. Let's see:\n\n- Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so no contribution.\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1\n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2\n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4\n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). \n\nSo, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nWhat about 8? Well, the hundreds digit cycles through 1,2,3,4, etc. 8 would appear in the hundreds place from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. \n\nSo, hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times. So, that's a difference of 89 in favor of 4.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188 and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, units place: 48 sets of 10, each contributing 1 to 4 and 8, so 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So, total units 4's: 48 +1=49, same for 8's: 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 times 4 and 10 times 8 in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 for both. Then, the remaining 88 pages (401-488) have the tens digit 4 appearing in 441-450 (10 times) and 8 appearing in 481-488 (8 times). So, 40 +10=50 for 4's, 40 +8=48 for 8's. That adds up.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times. 8 doesn't appear at all. So, 89 for 4's, 0 for 8's.\n\nAdding up: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188 for 4's.\n\n8's: 49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =97.\n\nDifference: 188 -97=91.\n\nWait, but wait a second, when I was calculating the hundreds place, I considered 400-488 as 89 pages. Let me check that: 488 - 400 +1 =89, correct.\n\nAlso, in the tens place, for 401-488, I considered the tens digits correctly. From 401-410, tens digit is 0; 411-420, tens digit is1; up to 481-488, tens digit is8. So, 441-450 is where the tens digit is4, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. And 481-488 is 8 numbers, so 8 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 481-488 is 8 numbers, but the tens digit is8 for all of them, right? So, that's correct.\n\nHmm, I think my calculations are correct. So, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is97, so 188-97=91. So, 4's appear 91 more times than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check again, maybe I missed something. Let me recount the units place again.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, each 10 pages have one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1 to 4 and 8, so 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 pages: 481-488. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484), 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48+1=49, 49. Correct.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 times 4 and 10 times 8. So, 40 each. Then, 401-488: 88 pages. The tens digits here go from 0 to8, but only up to 88 pages. So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 pages. 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, 40+10=50 for 4's, 40+8=48 for 8's. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times. 8 doesn't appear. So, 89 for 4's, 0 for 8's.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's:49+50+89=188, 8's:49+48+0=97. 188-97=91.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the tens place, 4's have 50 and 8's have 48, so 2 more 4's. In the hundreds place, 4's have 89 more than 8's. Units place, same. So, overall, 89+2=91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Units Place Analysis:**\n   - Each set of 10 consecutive numbers contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n   - Total sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full sets and 8 extra pages.\n   - Units place 4's: 48 (from sets) + 1 (from 484) = 49.\n   - Units place 8's: 48 (from sets) + 1 (from 488) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place Analysis:**\n   - Each set of 100 pages contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n   - 4 full hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - Remaining pages (401-488):\n     - 441-450: 10 4's in the tens place.\n     - 481-488: 8 8's in the tens place.\n   - Tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Tens place 8's: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place Analysis:**\n   - 400-488: 89 pages where the hundreds digit is 4.\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Hundreds place 4's: 89.\n   - Hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - Total 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe digit 4 appears 91 more times than the digit 8.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"
