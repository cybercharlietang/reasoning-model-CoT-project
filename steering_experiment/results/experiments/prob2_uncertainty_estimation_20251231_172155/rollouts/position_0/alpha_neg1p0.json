    "text": " I need to find the difference between the number of 4's and 8's. \n\nFirst, I should understand the problem clearly. Each page is numbered from 1 to 488, and I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to get the answer.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to break down the problem by looking at each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds, etc. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to three digits. So, I'll need to consider the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place for each digit.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For each digit from 0 to 9, each digit appears equally often in the units place, right? So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in the units place. For example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, each digit appears once in the units place every 10 numbers.\n\nBut wait, in our case, the page numbers start at 1, so the first page is 1, not 0. So, the first block is 1-10, then 11-20, and so on. So, each block of 10 pages will have one 4 and one 8 in the units place. But I need to confirm if this holds true for all blocks.\n\nLet me take the first few blocks to check. Pages 1-10: units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, 4 appears once, 8 appears once.\n\nPages 11-20: units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. Again, 4 once, 8 once.\n\nSimilarly, pages 21-30: same pattern. So, in each block of 10, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place.\n\nNow, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 pages and then 8 more pages (481-488). So, in the units place, each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times in each block, except for the last partial block.\n\nWait, no, actually, each block contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 full blocks, that's 48 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place. Then, in the last partial block (pages 481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, the digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once, and 8 appears once in this partial block as well. So, total units place counts:\n\n4's: 48 (from full blocks) +1 (partial block) = 49\n8's: 48 +1 = 49\n\nSo, in the units place, 4 and 8 each appear 49 times. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nNext, I need to consider the tens place. In the tens place, digits cycle every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), then 1 (11-19), 2 (21-29), ..., up to 9 (91-99). So, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred.\n\nWait, let me think again. From 1-99, the tens digit is 0 for pages 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, etc., up to 9 for 90-99. So, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. But in our case, the book goes up to 488, which is less than 500, so we have 4 hundreds: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488.\n\nWait, no, 488 is less than 500, so let's see: 1-99 is the first hundred, 100-199 is the second, 200-299 third, 300-399 fourth, and then 400-488 is the fifth, but only up to 488.\n\nWait, but in terms of hundreds, each hundred block contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for each hundred, like 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9, each appearing 10 times. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8.\n\nBut let me confirm this. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for pages 40-49, which is 10 pages. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place for pages 80-89, which is another 10 pages. So, each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, how many full hundreds do we have in 488 pages? Let's see:\n\n- Pages 1-99: first hundred\n- Pages 100-199: second hundred\n- Pages 200-299: third hundred\n- Pages 300-399: fourth hundred\n- Pages 400-488: fifth hundred, but only up to 488.\n\nSo, that's four full hundreds (1-399) and then 400-488. Wait, no, 400-488 is part of the fifth hundred, but it's not a full hundred. So, in each of the first four hundreds (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit cycles through 0-9, so each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, in each of these four hundreds, 4's and 8's each appear 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the fifth hundred, which is 400-488, how does the tens digit behave? Let's see:\n\n- Pages 400-488: the tens digit goes from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digits are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, but only up to 488, so the last group is 480-488, which is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit in 400-488 is 0 (400-409), 1 (410-419), ..., up to 8 (480-488). So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears, but how many times?\n\n- Tens digit 0: pages 400-409: 10 pages\n- Tens digit 1: 410-419: 10\n- ...\n- Tens digit 8: 480-488: 9 pages\n\nSo, in the tens place for 400-488:\n\n- 4's in the tens place: when the tens digit is 4, which is pages 440-449. That's 10 pages.\n- 8's in the tens place: when the tens digit is 8, which is pages 480-488. That's 9 pages.\n\nSo, in the fifth hundred (400-488), the tens digit contributes 10 4's and 9 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the tens place contributions:\n\n- For the first four hundreds (1-399): each contributes 10 4's and 10 8's, so total 4*10=40 4's and 4*10=40 8's.\n- For the fifth hundred (400-488): 10 4's and 9 8's.\n\nSo, total in tens place:\n\n4's: 40 +10 =50\n\n8's:40 +9=49\n\nSo, in the tens place, there are 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only present from page 100 onwards. So, in 1-99, there is no hundreds digit. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place.\n\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1. So, no 4's or 8's here.\n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2. Again, no 4's or 8's.\n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3. Still no 4's or 8's.\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4. So, every page from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4. How many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 +1 =89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, does the digit 8 ever appear in the hundreds place? Let's see. The next hundred after 400-488 would be 500-599, but our book stops at 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place in this book.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place:\n\n4's:89\n\n8's:0\n\nNow, let's sum up all the places:\n\nUnits place:\n\n4's:49\n\n8's:49\n\nTens place:\n\n4's:50\n\n8's:49\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's:89\n\n8's:0\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\n\nWait, wait, that can't be right. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the units place, I had 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nIn the tens place, 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8, so 48 each, plus the last 8 pages (481-488), which have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So, units place:4's=48+1=49, 8's=48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nIn each full hundred (1-99,100-199,200-299,300-399), the tens digit cycles through 0-9, each appearing 10 times. So, each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, four hundreds:4*10=40 4's and 40 8's.\n\nIn the fifth hundred (400-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. For 4's in the tens place, it's when the tens digit is 4, which is pages 440-449:10 pages, so 10 4's.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, it's pages 480-488:9 pages, so 9 8's.\n\nSo, total in tens place:4's=40+10=50, 8's=40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly pages 400-488 have the hundreds digit as 4, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's.\n\n8's in hundreds place:0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n\n8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0 (hundreds)=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the hundreds place would only contribute 4's, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nYes, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 pages, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's there.\n\nAnd for 8's, since the book ends at 488, there's no page 800, so no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, 8's:98.\n\nSo, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in the units place?\n\nFrom 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 pages, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens and 8 extra pages.\n\nSo, 48 times 1=48, plus in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once. So, total 49.\n\nSame for 8's:48 full tens, each contributing one 8, plus one in the last 8 pages, so 49.\n\nSo, units place:49 each.\n\nTens place:\n\nIn each hundred, 10 times each digit, so 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place per hundred.\n\nFour full hundreds:4*10=40 each.\n\nIn the fifth hundred, 400-488, the tens digit runs from 0 to 8.\n\nFor 4's in the tens place: when the tens digit is 4, which is pages 440-449:10 pages, so 10 4's.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place: pages 480-488:9 pages, so 9 8's.\n\nSo, total in tens place:4's=40+10=50, 8's=40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:89 4's, 0 8's.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because I feel like the difference might be higher. Let me check another way.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the total number of 4's and 8's separately.\n\nTotal number of 4's:\n\nUnits place: as above, 49\n\nTens place:50\n\nHundreds place:89\n\nTotal:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal number of 8's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:49\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nTotal:49+49=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me think about the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's.\n\nIs there any other place where 4 appears in the hundreds place? No, because the book ends at 488, so no higher hundreds.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, they don't appear in the hundreds place at all.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe I missed something in the units or tens place. Let me try a different approach.\n\nAnother way to calculate the number of times a digit appears is to consider each digit position separately and count how many times the digit appears in each position.\n\nFor the units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10)*1 + min(max(488 mod 10,4),9) - 3? Wait, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nActually, for the units digit, the number of times a digit d appears is:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: floor(488/10)=48, each contributing 1 occurrence of d in the units place.\n\nThen, in the remaining pages (488 mod 10=8), we check if d is less than or equal to 8. Since d=4, it is, so we add 1.\n\nSo, total 4's in units place:48*1 +1=49.\n\nSame for 8's:48*1 +1=49.\n\nFor the tens digit:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the tens place is:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 100: floor(488/100)=4, each contributing 10 occurrences of d in the tens place.\n\nThen, in the remaining pages (488 mod 100=88), the number of times d appears in the tens place is:\n\nIf d < (88/10)=8.8, then d appears 10 times, else 10*(d) - something. Wait, maybe it's better to think as:\n\nIn the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit runs from 0 up to 8 (since 88 is 8*10 +8). So, for d=4, it appears 10 times (40-49 in the current hundred). For d=8, it appears 9 times (80-88).\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place:4*10 +10=50\n\nTotal 8's in tens place:4*10 +9=49\n\nFor the hundreds digit:\n\nNumber of times d appears in hundreds place:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 1000: floor(488/1000)=0, but since we're dealing with hundreds, it's actually floor(488/100)=4, but that's not the right way.\n\nWait, the hundreds digit is determined by the hundreds place. So, for each hundred block, the hundreds digit is constant.\n\nSo, from 1-99: hundreds digit 0 (but not printed, so no 4's or 8's here).\n\nFrom 100-199: hundreds digit 1.\n\nFrom 200-299: hundreds digit 2.\n\nFrom 300-399: hundreds digit 3.\n\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit 4.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's.\n\n8's in hundreds place: none, since the book doesn't reach 800.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units)+50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total pages: 488.\n   - Number of complete groups of 10: 48.\n   - Remaining pages: 8 (481-488).\n   - 4's in units place: 48*1 +1 =49.\n   - 8's in units place:48*1 +1=49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times in every 100 pages.\n   - Complete hundreds:4 (1-399).\n   - 4's in tens place:4*10=40.\n   - 8's in tens place:4*10=40.\n   - Partial hundred (400-488):\n     - 4's:10 (440-449).\n     - 8's:9 (480-488).\n   - Total 4's:40+10=50.\n   - Total 8's:40+9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4's:89 (400-488).\n   - 8's:0.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n   - 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 -98=90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Each page is printed once, starting from page 1 up to page 488.\n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the problem. Page numbers can be one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit numbers. So, pages 1 to 9 are single-digit, 10 to 99 are two-digit, and 100 to 488 are three-digit. I should handle each of these ranges separately to count the occurrences of 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers (1-9). In this range, the only pages that have a 4 or an 8 are page 4 and page 8. So, for single-digit pages, the count for 4's is 1 and for 8's is also 1.\n\nNext, moving on to two-digit page numbers (10-99). Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nFor the tens place in two-digit numbers:\n- The digit 4 appears in the tens place for pages 40-49. That's 10 pages, so 10 times.\n- The digit 8 appears in the tens place for pages 80-89. That's another 10 pages, so 10 times.\n\nFor the units place in two-digit numbers:\n- The digit 4 appears once every ten pages, specifically at pages 4, 14, 24, ..., 94. From 10 to 99, that's 9 times (since 4 is already counted in single digits, but wait, no, in the two-digit range, the units digit 4 starts at 14, so 14,24,...,94. That's 9 instances, right? Wait, no, because from 10 to 99, the units digit cycles every 10, so 10 numbers where the units digit is 4: 14,24,...,94. So that's 9 times? Wait, no, 14 is the first, then 24, 34,...,94. That's 9 numbers, but wait, 10 to 99 is 90 numbers, so 90/10=9. So 9 times for 4 in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the units place: 18,28,...,98. That's also 9 times.\n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, the total count for 4's is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. For 8's, it's 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Because in the two-digit numbers, the tens place for 4 is 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. The units digit for 4 in two-digit numbers would be from 14,24,...,94, which is 9 numbers (since 4 is already in single digits, but in two-digit numbers, it's 14,24,...,94, which is 9 numbers). So, 10 + 9 = 19 for 4's.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, tens place is 80-89, 10 numbers, and units place is 18,28,...,98, which is 9 numbers, so 10 + 9 = 19 for 8's.\n\nSo, in two-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear 19 times each.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because each page number has a hundreds place, a tens place, and a units place. I need to count the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each of these places separately.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book has 488 pages. So, pages 100-199 have 1 in the hundreds place, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4.\n\nNow, let's count how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place: from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nFor the digit 8 in the hundreds place: since the book only goes up to 488, there are no pages where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be any digit from 0 to 9, and we need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in this position across all three-digit page numbers.\n\nSimilarly, the units place can be any digit from 0 to 9, and we need to count 4's and 8's there as well.\n\nLet's start with the tens place. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 100 pages. So, for each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.), and similarly for 8.\n\nBut since our book goes up to 488, we have to consider the hundreds up to 400-488.\n\nSo, for the tens place:\n\n- For hundreds 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: Each of these hundreds has 10 pages where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.), and 10 pages where the tens digit is 8 (e.g., 180-189, etc.). So, for each hundred, that's 10 for 4 and 10 for 8. There are 3 full hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), so that's 3 * 10 = 30 for 4's and 30 for 8's.\n\n- Now, for the hundreds 400-488: The tens digit here can go from 0 to 8 because 488 is the last page. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages. The tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 pages.\n\nSo, in the tens place for 400-488, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nTherefore, total for the tens place:\n\n- 4's: 30 (from 100-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 40\n- 8's: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. Similar to the tens place, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, for each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the units place across each ten.\n\nBut again, we have to consider the full hundreds and the partial hundred (400-488).\n\nFor the units place:\n\n- For hundreds 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: Each hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 in the units place (e.g., 104, 114, ..., 194 for 100-199; similarly for others). So, 3 * 10 = 30 for 4's. Similarly, 8's would be 3 * 10 = 30.\n\n- For the hundreds 400-488: The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each ten. So, in 400-488, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the units place?\n\nEach ten (like 400-409, 410-419, etc.) has one 4 and one 8 in the units place. But since 488 is the last page, we need to check if 488 is included.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, there are 89 pages. Let's see how many full tens are there. 89 pages mean 8 full tens (400-409, ..., 470-479) and then 480-488, which is 9 pages.\n\nIn each full ten, the units digit 4 appears once (e.g., 404, 414, etc.) and 8 appears once (408, 418, etc.). So, for 8 full tens, that's 8 * 1 = 8 times for 4's and 8 times for 8's.\n\nNow, in the last partial ten, 480-488, the units digits go from 0 to 8. So, the units digit 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, that's 1 for 4 and 1 for 8.\n\nTherefore, total for units place in 400-488:\n\n- 4's: 8 (from full tens) + 1 (from 480-488) = 9\n- 8's: 8 (from full tens) + 1 (from 480-488) = 9\n\nSo, total for the units place:\n\n- 4's: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39\n- 8's: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit across all three-digit numbers.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Hundreds place: 89\n- Tens place: 40\n- Units place: 39\nTotal 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n\nFor 8's:\n- Hundreds place: 0\n- Tens place: 39\n- Units place: 39\nTotal 8's in three-digit numbers: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nNow, let's add up all the counts from single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nTotal 4's:\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\nTotal: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n\nTotal 8's:\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\nTotal: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's are printed: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, single-digit: 4 appears once, 8 appears once.\n\nTwo-digit: 4's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19; 8's: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0.\n- Tens place: 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n- Units place: 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\nAdding up for 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n\nAdding up for 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places across all page numbers.\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - 4 appears once (page 4).\n   - 8 appears once (page 8).\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears 9 times (14,24,...,94), 8 appears 9 times (18,28,...,98).\n   - Total: 19 for 4, 19 for 8.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 appears 0 times.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n   - Total: 168 for 4, 78 for 8.\n\n**Total counts:**\n- 4's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n- 8's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " I need to solve this step by step, so let me break it down.\n\nFirst, I should understand the problem correctly. Each page is numbered from 1 to 488, and I need to count how many times the digit '4' appears in all these page numbers and then subtract the number of times '8' appears. The result will be how many more '4's there are than '8's.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to count the number of 4's and 8's separately and then find the difference. To do this, I'll consider each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit '4' appears exactly once in the units place.\n   - Since the book has 488 pages, the number of complete blocks of 10 is 48 (because 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete blocks).\n   - Therefore, the number of 4's in the units place is 48.\n\n   Wait, but 488 is not a multiple of 10, so there's an extra 8 pages beyond the 480th page. In these extra pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit '4' appears once more in the units place (at page 484). So, total units place 4's = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is '4' for 10 pages: 40-49.\n   - So, in each block of 100, there are 10 occurrences of '4' in the tens place.\n   - Now, 488 \u00f7 100 = 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks of 100 and a partial block of 88 pages.\n   - The complete blocks contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 '4's in the tens place.\n   - Now, the partial block is from 400 to 488. The tens digit in this block is '4' only from 440 to 449, which is 10 pages. So, that's another 10 '4's.\n   - Therefore, total tens place 4's = 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is '4' only in the pages from 400 to 488.\n   - From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - So, the digit '4' appears in the hundreds place 89 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\nNow, I'll do the same for the digit '8'.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - As with 4's, every block of 10 pages has one '8' in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks of 10 in 488 pages, so 48 '8's.\n   - The extra 8 pages (481-488) include page 488, which has an '8' in the units place. So, that's one more '8'.\n   - So, units place '8's = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit is '8' in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each block of 100 pages has 10 '8's in the tens place.\n   - There are 4 complete blocks of 100 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 '8's, so 4\u00d710=40.\n   - Now, the partial block from 401-488: the tens digit is '8' only in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480 to 488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is '8' in 480-488, which is 9 pages. Wait, but 480 has '8' in tens place, 481 to 488 also have '8' in tens place. So that's 9 '8's in the tens place.\n   - So, total tens place '8's = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 400-488, the tens digit is '8' only in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 9 '8's in the tens place. So, total tens place '8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is '8' only in the pages from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no '8's in the hundreds place.\n   - So, hundreds place '8's = 0.\n\nAdding up all the '8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal '8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, total 4's are 188, and total 8's are 98.\n\nNow, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me recount the '4's.\n\n**Rechecking 4's:**\n\n- Units place: 48 full blocks (1-480) give 48 '4's. Then, from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so '4' appears once at 484. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: Each block of 100 has 10 '4's in tens place. So, 4 blocks (1-400) give 4\u00d710=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is '4' in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, 40 + 10 = 50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 '4's in hundreds place. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Correct.\n\n**Rechecking 8's:**\n\n- Units place: 48 full blocks (1-480) give 48 '8's. Then, 488 has an '8' in units place, so 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 4 blocks of 100 (1-400) give 4\u00d710=40 '8's. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is '8' in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So, 9 '8's. So, 40 +9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: No '8's because the book ends at 488. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 +49=98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I feel like that's a lot. Let me see if I missed anything.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 '4's in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the tens place for 4's again. From 1-400, each block of 100 has 10 '4's in the tens place, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is '4' in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 more. So, 40 +10=50. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit is '8' in 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 9 '8's. So, 40 +9=49. Correct.\n\nWait, but in the units place for 8's, I counted 49, which is correct because 488 is included.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's using a formula or another method to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of each digit position separately.\n\nFor the units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's = floor(488/10) + (if 488 mod 10 >=4, add 1 else 0). So, floor(488/10)=48, and 488 mod 10=8 >=4, so 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in units place: floor(488/10)=48, and 488 mod10=8, so 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nFor the tens digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9, so for each hundred, the number of times 4 appears in tens place is 10. So, for 488 pages, how many hundreds? 4 full hundreds (1-400). So, 4\u00d710=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 40 +10=50. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in tens place: For each hundred, 10 times. So, 4\u00d710=40. In the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 +9=49. Correct.\n\nFor the hundreds digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 '4's in hundreds place.\n\nNumber of 8's: From 800 onwards, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are 0 '8's in hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more '4's than '8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of '4's:**\n   - **Units place:** Each block of 10 pages contributes 1 '4'. With 48 full blocks (480 pages), there are 48 '4's. The remaining 8 pages (481-488) include one more '4' (at 484). Total: 49.\n   - **Tens place:** Each block of 100 pages contributes 10 '4's. Four blocks (1-400) give 40 '4's. The partial block (401-488) adds another 10 '4's (440-449). Total: 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 contribute 89 '4's. Total: 89.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of '8's:**\n   - **Units place:** Each block of 10 contributes 1 '8'. With 48 full blocks, there are 48 '8's. The last page (488) adds one more. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens place:** Each block of 100 contributes 10 '8's. Four blocks give 40 '8's. The partial block (401-488) adds 9 '8's (480-488). Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No '8's since the book ends at 488. Total: 0.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:** \n   - Number of '4's (188) minus number of '8's (98) equals 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 times more than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " I need to break this down step by step because I'm still getting comfortable with these kinds of counting problems.\n\nFirst, I think I should figure out how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense.\n\nLet me start by understanding how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number since 488 is a three-digit number. So, I'll need to consider units, tens, and hundreds places separately for both 4 and 8.\n\nI remember that when counting digits in numbers, it's helpful to break down each digit's place (units, tens, hundreds) and calculate how many times each digit appears in each place.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place.\n   - To find out how many such blocks there are in 488 pages, I can divide 488 by 10. That gives me 48 full blocks and a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 more numbers.\n   - In each full block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (from 481 to 488), the units digit cycles from 1 to 8. So, the units digit 4 appears once more here (at 484).\n   - So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n   - So, in each 100-number block, there are 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n   - Now, 488 divided by 100 is 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more numbers (401-488).\n   - In each of the 4 full blocks, there are 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 in the tens place. The 4 in the tens place occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, our range is up to 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488. So, that's another 10 4's in the tens place.\n   - So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.\n   - Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences.\n   - Wait, but I'm only counting the digit 4, so yes, each number contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, no, actually, I think I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Wait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me check again. 400 is the first page with a 4 in the hundreds place, and 488 is the last. So, yes, 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I calculated the tens place, I considered 4 full blocks (1-400) each contributing 10 4's, so 4*10=40, and then from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more, making 50. That seems correct.\n\nIn the units place, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48, plus the last partial block (481-488) which includes 484, so one more, making 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, but wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to the 4's, in every block of 10, the digit 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - 488 divided by 10 is 48 full blocks and 8 remaining numbers.\n   - So, 48 times from the full blocks, plus one more if the remaining numbers include an 8 in the units place.\n   - The remaining numbers are 481 to 488, so the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 488 is included, which is an 8 in the units place.\n   - So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In each block of 100, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n   - So, 4 full blocks of 100 (1-400) each contribute 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n   - Now, the remaining 88 numbers (401-488). The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The 8 in the tens place occurs in 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, 9 8's in the tens place here.\n   - So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n   - So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me check again.\n\nUnits place: 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48, plus the last partial block (481-488) which includes 488, so one more, making 49.\n\nTens place: 4 full blocks contributing 10 each, so 40, plus the remaining 88 numbers where the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more, making 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's.\n\nNumber of 4's: 188\nNumber of 8's: 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that's a big difference. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, when I counted the hundreds place for 4's, I had 89, which seems right because from 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nBut let me think again about the tens place for 4's. From 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, correct.\n\nAnd for the units place, 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, and the last block contributing 1 more, so 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's, units and tens each contribute 49, so 98 total.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit surprised that the difference is 90. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me recount.\n\nFrom page 1 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place for 4's: Each 100 block has 10 4's in the tens place. There are 4 full blocks (1-400), so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 +10=50. That's correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, and the last block (481-488) has 484, so 1 more. So, 49. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 +50 +89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48, plus the last block (481-488) has 488, so 1 more, making 49.\n\nTens place: 4 full blocks, each contributing 10, so 40, plus from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488-480=8, so plus 1 is 9. So, 9 more, making 49.\n\nSo, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nThus, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm thinking, 90 seems a bit high, but maybe it's correct. Let me think of a smaller example to test my method.\n\nSuppose we have a book with page numbers from 1 to 20. Let's count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\n4's:\n- Units place: 4 and 14, so 2 times.\n- Tens place: 40-49, but since we only go up to 20, there are none.\n- Hundreds place: none.\nTotal 4's:2.\n\n8's:\n- Units place:8 and 18, so 2 times.\n- Tens place: none, since 80-89 is beyond 20.\n- Hundreds place: none.\nTotal 8's:2.\n\nDifference: 2-2=0. That makes sense.\n\nAnother example: 1 to 100.\n\n4's:\n- Units:10 (4,14,...,94)\n- Tens:10 (40-49)\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal 4's:20.\n\n8's:\n- Units:10 (8,18,...,98)\n- Tens:10 (80-89)\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal 8's:20.\n\nDifference:0. Correct.\n\nAnother example: 1 to 200.\n\n4's:\n- Units:20 (4,14,...,194)\n- Tens:20 (40-49, 140-149)\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal 4's:40.\n\n8's:\n- Units:20 (8,18,...,198)\n- Tens:20 (80-89, 180-189)\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal 8's:40.\n\nDifference:0. Correct.\n\nWait, so in the case of 488, the difference is 90. That seems correct based on the calculations.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's using another method to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of each digit place separately.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: As calculated, 49.\n- Tens place:50.\n- Hundreds place:89.\nTotal:188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place:49.\n- Tens place:49.\n- Hundreds place:0.\nTotal:98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the number of times the digits 4 and 8 appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** \n     - In every block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place.\n     - Total blocks: 48 full blocks (1-480) and a partial block (481-488).\n     - Units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens place:** \n     - In every block of 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49).\n     - Total blocks: 4 full blocks (1-400) contributing 40, and 440-449 in the remaining 88 numbers contributing 10.\n     - Tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** \n     - From 400 to 488, each page number contributes a 4 in the hundreds place.\n     - Total: 89 (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** \n     - Similar to 4's, 48 full blocks contribute 48, and the last block (481-488) includes 488.\n     - Units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens place:** \n     - 4 full blocks contribute 40, and the remaining 88 numbers include 480-488, contributing 9.\n     - Tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** \n     - No pages have 8 in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n     - Hundreds place 8's: 0.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " I'm going to try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I need to understand how page numbers work. Each page number is a number from 1 to 488, and each digit in these numbers is either a 4 or an 8. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears, then subtract the two to find the difference.\n\nI guess I can approach this by looking at each digit place separately: the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place. Since 488 is a three-digit number, I'll have to consider all three places.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For every group of ten consecutive numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, and so on, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of ten, the digit 4 will appear once in the units place, and the digit 8 will also appear once. So, for the units place, the number of 4's and 8's should be the same, right?\n\nWait, but I need to confirm how many complete groups of ten there are in 488 pages. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of ten and then 8 more pages (481 to 488). So, in each of these 48 groups, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So that's 48 times each. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49 fours, and 48 + 1 = 49 eights. So, same count here.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So, in the units place, 4's and 8's are equal. So, maybe the difference comes from the tens place or the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (80-89). So, in each hundred, 4's and 8's in the tens place are equal, 10 each.\n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, we have four complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each of these hundreds contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, that's 4 * 10 = 40 fours and 40 eights.\n\nBut wait, after 400, we have pages 401 to 488. So, the tens digit in this range is 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), and 8 (481-488). So, in the tens place, how many fours and eights do we have here?\n\nLooking at 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 481-490, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in the tens place for 401-488, we have 10 fours and 8 eights.\n\nSo, total in the tens place: 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 10 = 50 fours, and 40 + 8 = 48 eights.\n\nWait, that's a difference here. So, in the tens place, fours are 50 and eights are 48, so fours are 2 more than eights.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, actually, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4, right?\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So, that's 89 fours.\n\nHow about the hundreds digit for 8's? Well, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, the count of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, we have 89 fours and 0 eights. That's a big difference.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nStarting with fours:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal fours = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nNow, eights:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal eights = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 + 89 is 188? Let me check that again.\n\n49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99, plus 89 (hundreds) is 188. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nFor eights: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) = 97, plus 0 is 97.\n\nSo, the number of fours is 188 and eights is 97. So, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the tens place. Let me go through that again.\n\nIn the tens place:\n\n- For the first four hundreds (1-400), each contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40 each.\n\n- Then, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 4, that's 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours.\n\n- When the tens digit is 8, that's 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 eights.\n\nSo, in the tens place, total fours: 40 + 10 = 50, and eights: 40 + 8 = 48. That seems correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 fours, and no eights.\n\nSo, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nEights: units (49) + tens (48) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nSo, 188 fours minus 97 eights is 91 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me see if I can think of another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately.\n\nLet's calculate the number of 4's:\n\n- Units place: For each 10 numbers, there's one 4. There are 48 full decades (1-480), so 48 fours. Then, from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484). So, total units place fours: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Tens place: For each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 4 hundreds in 488, so 4 * 10 = 40 fours. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 441-450, which is 10 fours. So, total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, number of 8's:\n\n- Units place: Similarly, each 10 numbers have one 8. 48 full decades give 48 eights, and from 481-488, the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, total units place eights: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred has 10 eights in the tens place (80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are 4 hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40 eights. In the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 eights. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\n- Hundreds place: As before, there are no 8's in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nSo, 188 fours minus 97 eights is indeed 91. So, the answer should be 91 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, right? Because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, when I was counting from 401-488, I considered that the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (441-450) and 8 for 8 numbers (481-488). That seems correct because 481-488 is 8 numbers, so 8 eights.\n\nWait, but 481-488 is 8 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's correct.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So, the number of fours printed is 188, and the number of eights is 97, so the difference is 91.\n\nWait, but let me just think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it, but I want to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately, which I did, and then sum them up. So, units, tens, hundreds.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the final answer is 91 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each group of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 complete groups (1-480) and 8 additional pages (481-488).\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - For 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, contributing 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - From 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (441-450) and 8 for 8 numbers (481-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 8 = 48\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers.\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 97 = 91\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Each page is numbered from 1 to 488, and each digit is printed separately. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears and how many times the digit 8 appears, then find the difference between these two counts.\n\nLet me start by understanding how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. For example, page 1 is just '1', page 10 is '10', and page 100 is '100'. Since the book has 488 pages, the highest page number is 488, which is a three-digit number.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to break down the problem by each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll calculate how many times the digit 4 appears in each position and do the same for the digit 8, then sum them up and find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's consider the units place. The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, in every block of 10 consecutive pages (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place (e.g., 4, 14, 24, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears once (e.g., 8, 18, 28, etc.).\n\nNow, let's find out how many complete blocks of 10 there are in 488 pages. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48 complete blocks with 8 pages remaining (since 48*10=480, and 488-480=8). In each of these 48 blocks, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for the units place, 4 appears 48 times, and 8 appears 48 times.\n\nBut wait, we have 8 remaining pages after 480. These are pages 481 to 488. Let's check if the units digit in these pages has any 4 or 8. Page 484 has a 4 in the units place, and page 488 has an 8. So, in the remaining 8 pages, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). Therefore, the total count for units place is 48+1=49 for 4 and 48+1=49 for 8. Hmm, so actually, in the units place, both digits appear 49 times. That means for the units place, the count of 4's and 8's is the same.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit changes every 10 pages and remains the same for 10 consecutive pages. For example, from page 1 to 10, the tens digit is 0 (since it's 01 to 10), but wait, actually, page 1 is just 1, so maybe I should think of it as pages 1-9 having no tens digit, but starting from page 10, the tens digit becomes 1. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me correct that.\n\nActually, for the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every 100 pages. For example, in pages 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for pages 1-9, but actually, pages 1-9 don't have a tens digit, so maybe it's better to consider pages 00-99 as three-digit numbers, but since we're starting from page 1, perhaps it's a bit different. Wait, maybe I should approach this more carefully.\n\nLet me consider the tens digit. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. For example, in pages 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for pages 1-9 (but wait, page 1 is just 1, so maybe the tens digit is 0 for pages 1-9, but when we get to page 10, the tens digit becomes 1, and so on up to page 99, where the tens digit is 9, and then page 100 starts a new hundred with tens digit 0 again. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to think that for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for example, in pages 1-100, the tens digit 0 appears in pages 1-9 (but actually, pages 1-9 don't have a tens digit, so maybe it's better to think of them as 01-09, but that's not the case. So perhaps I should adjust my approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that for each hundred, the number of times each digit appears in the tens place is 10 times. So, for example, in pages 1-100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place in pages 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place in pages 80-89, which is 10 times.\n\nNow, since the book has 488 pages, which is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So, let's break it down:\n\n1. From page 1 to 100: The tens digit cycles through 0-9, each appearing 10 times. So, digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\n2. From page 101 to 200: Similarly, the tens digit cycles again, so another 10 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n\n3. From page 201 to 300: Another 10 each.\n\n4. From page 301 to 400: Another 10 each.\n\n5. From page 401 to 488: Now, here, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, let's check how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nIn pages 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490), but since we only go up to 488, the last set is 80-88 in the tens place, but let's see:\n\nWait, pages 401-410: tens digit is 0.\n\n411-420: tens digit is 1.\n\n...\n\n441-450: tens digit is 4.\n\nSimilarly, 481-490: tens digit is 8, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 pages.\n\nSo, in the tens place from 401-488, the digit 4 appears in pages 441-450, which is 10 times (441 to 450). But wait, 450 is within 488, so that's fine.\n\nThe digit 8 appears in the tens place in pages 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, the digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place in this last partial hundred.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because from 401-488, the hundreds digit is 4, and the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the digit 4 in the tens place occurs in 441-450, which is 10 times. The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in 481-490, but since we stop at 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place:\n\n- For each complete hundred (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each digit 4 and 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, that's 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 times each.\n\n- In the last partial hundred (401-488), 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n\nSo, total for tens place:\n\n- 4's: 40 + 10 = 50 times.\n\n- 8's: 40 + 8 = 48 times.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because from 401-488, the tens digit for 4 is 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. The tens digit for 8 is 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 pages, so 8 times.\n\nSo, total for tens place:\n\n- 4's: 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 (from each hundred) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50.\n\n- 8's: 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 + 8 (from 401-488) = 48.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because from 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place, so 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 each. Then, from 401-488, 4's in the tens place occur 10 times (441-450), and 8's occur 8 times (481-488). So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nWait, but that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 onwards. Pages 1-99 have no hundreds digit, pages 100-199 have hundreds digit 1, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's summarize:\n\n- Units place:\n  - 4's: 49\n  - 8's: 49\n\n- Tens place:\n  - 4's: 50\n  - 8's: 48\n\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 4's: 89\n  - 8's: 0\n\nNow, let's add them up:\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\n- From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 pages, so 48 full tens (480 pages) contribute 48 times, and then from 481-488, page 484 has a 4, so total 49.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears in the units place 49 times (once every 10 pages, 48 times in 480 pages, and page 488 adds one more).\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 for 4's and 40 for 8's.\n\nThen, from 401-488, 4's in tens place occur in 441-450, which is 10 times, and 8's occur in 481-488, which is 8 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: from 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\n- 8's: 0 times.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99; 99+89=188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place calculation for the last partial hundred. Let me check again.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8.\n\n- For 4's in the tens place: it's when the tens digit is 4, so pages 440-449. Wait, but 440 is within 401-488, so that's 10 pages: 440-449. So, 10 times.\n\n- For 8's in the tens place: it's when the tens digit is 8, so pages 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, it's pages 480-488, which is 9 pages. Wait, that's 9 pages, not 8. So, 480-488 is 9 pages (including both 480 and 488). So, 9 times.\n\nWait, that changes things. Earlier, I thought it was 8 pages, but actually, it's 9 pages. So, in the tens place from 401-488, 8's appear 9 times, not 8.\n\nSo, correcting that:\n\nTens place:\n\n- 4's: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (440-449) = 50.\n\n- 8's: 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (480-488) = 49.\n\nSo, now, total 8's in the tens place is 49.\n\nThen, total 8's overall would be:\n\nUnits: 49\n\nTens: 49\n\nHundreds: 0\n\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier count. Let me check again.\n\nWait, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in pages 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 pages where the tens digit is 8.\n\nSo, in the tens place, from 401-488, 8's appear 9 times, not 8. Therefore, total 8's in the tens place is 40 (from 1-400) + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, now, total 8's:\n\nUnits: 49\n\nTens: 49\n\nHundreds: 0\n\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSimilarly, 4's in the tens place:\n\nFrom 401-488, 4's in the tens place occur in pages 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSo, total 4's:\n\nUnits: 49\n\nTens: 50\n\nHundreds: 89\n\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n\nUnits: 49\n\nTens: 49\n\nHundreds: 0\n\nTotal: 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 91, but now it's 90. Which is correct?\n\nWait, let me go through the tens place again.\n\nFrom 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place, so 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 for 4's and 40 for 8's.\n\nFrom 401-488:\n\n- 4's in tens place: 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times.\n\n- 8's in tens place: 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, units place: 49 each.\n\nTens place: 50 for 4's, 49 for 8's.\n\nHundreds place: 89 for 4's, 0 for 8's.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, the correct difference is 90, not 91. I must have made a mistake earlier by counting 8 pages instead of 9 in the tens place for 8's in the last partial hundred.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. By analyzing each digit position (units, tens, and hundreds), we determine that the digit 4 appears 188 times and the digit 8 appears 98 times. The difference is calculated as follows:\n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - 4's: 49\n   - 8's: 49\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - 4's: 50\n   - 8's: 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - 4's: 89\n   - 8's: 0\n\nTotal counts:\n- 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n- 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " I need to find out how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears, then subtract the two to find the difference.\n\nFirst, I think I should break this down by looking at each digit place separately: the units place and the tens place. Because page numbers can be one, two, or three digits long, but since 488 is a three-digit number, I need to consider all three places. Wait, no, actually, page numbers from 1 to 488 can be one, two, or three digits. So maybe I should consider each digit position separately, like units, tens, and hundreds, and calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in each position.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, every 10 numbers, the digit cycles from 0 to 9. So in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 appears once. For example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So 4 appears once, 8 appears once.\n\nNow, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (from 481 to 488). So in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times, except for the last 8 numbers where the units digits are 1 through 8.\n\nWait, no, actually, for each complete set of 10, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. So for 48 complete sets, each digit appears 48 times. Then, in the incomplete set (481 to 488), the units digits are 1 through 8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So total units place 4's would be 48*1 +1=49, and 8's would be 48*1 +1=49. Hmm, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. So the difference in units place is 0.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, up to 9 for 90-99. So each digit appears 10 times in the tens place per hundred.\n\nNow, how many hundreds are in 488? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So for each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So for 4 hundreds, each digit appears 4*10=40 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 481-488). So for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does each appear? From 401-488, the tens digits are 0 (401-410, which is 10 numbers), 1 (411-420, 10), 2 (421-430, 10), 3 (431-440, 10), 4 (441-450, 10), 5 (451-460, 10), 6 (461-470, 10), 7 (471-480, 10), and 8 (481-488, which is 8 numbers). So for the tens digit, the digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). \n\nWait, but in the tens place, each hundred has 10 occurrences per digit, but in the last partial hundred, the tens digits go up to 8, so for each digit from 0 to 8, how many times does each appear? Let me think again. From 401 to 488, the tens digits cycle as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 numbers)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10)\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 numbers)\n\nSo in the tens place, digit 4 appears 10 times, and digit 8 appears 8 times in the last partial hundred. So overall, in the tens place, digit 4 appears 4*10 (from each complete hundred) +10 (from 441-450) = 50 times. Similarly, digit 8 appears 4*10 (from each complete hundred) +8 (from 481-488) = 48 times.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because in each complete hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So for 4 complete hundreds, each digit appears 4*10=40 times. Then, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, as we saw, digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (441-450), and digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So total for the tens place: 4's are 40+10=50, 8's are 40+8=48. So in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 48 times. So the difference in the tens place is 50-48=2.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is a bit different because it changes less frequently. From 1-99, there's no hundreds digit, so we can ignore that. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1. From 200-299, it's 2, and so on up to 400-488, where it's 4.\n\nSo, how many times does each hundreds digit appear? Let's see:\n\n- 100-199: 100 numbers, hundreds digit 1 appears 100 times.\n- 200-299: 100 numbers, hundreds digit 2 appears 100 times.\n- 300-399: 100 numbers, hundreds digit 3 appears 100 times.\n- 400-488: 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89), hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, right? Because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nNow, we're looking for how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place. From the above, 4 appears 89 times (from 400-488). 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book has only 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So the difference here is 89-0=89.\n\nNow, let's sum up the differences from each digit place:\n\n- Units place: 4's - 8's = 0\n- Tens place: 4's - 8's = 2\n- Hundreds place: 4's - 8's = 89\n\nTotal difference = 0 + 2 + 89 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place: 488 pages. Each 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So 48 complete sets of 10, which is 48*2=96, but wait, no, each set contributes one 4 and one 8. So 48 sets give 48 4's and 48 8's. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So total units 4's: 48+1=49, units 8's:48+1=49. So difference 0. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred, 10 occurrences of each digit. So 4 hundreds (1-400) give 4*10=40 for each digit. Then, in 401-488, the tens digits go up to 8, so digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So total tens 4's:40+10=50, tens 8's:40+8=48. Difference 2. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 appears 0 times. So difference 89.\n\nAdding up: 0 (units) +2 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =91.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those 89 numbers. So 89 times. Correct.\n\nBut wait, is 400 included? Yes, because the book starts at page 1 and ends at 488, so page 400 is included. So yes, 488-400+1=89.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's printed is 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nWait, no, wait, that's the total count of 4's. Similarly, total 8's would be 49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nSo the difference is 188-97=91.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought of it as the difference per digit place, which also added up to 91. So that's consistent.\n\nWait, but let me check: units 4's:49, units 8's:49.\n\nTens 4's:50, tens 8's:48.\n\nHundreds 4's:89, hundreds 8's:0.\n\nSo total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo the answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place Analysis:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 numbers in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488 pages, contributing 48 occurrences of each digit.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one more 4 and one more 8.\n   - **Total 4's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n   - **Total 8's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n   - **Difference in units place:** 49 - 49 = 0\n\n2. **Tens Place Analysis:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for every 100 numbers.\n   - For 400 pages (4 complete hundreds), each digit appears 40 times.\n   - The remaining 88 pages (401-488) add:\n     - 10 occurrences of 4 (441-450)\n     - 8 occurrences of 8 (481-488)\n   - **Total 4's in tens place:** 40 + 10 = 50\n   - **Total 8's in tens place:** 40 + 8 = 48\n   - **Difference in tens place:** 50 - 48 = 2\n\n3. **Hundreds Place Analysis:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n   - The hundreds digit never reaches 8 in a 488-page book.\n   - **Total 4's in hundreds place:** 89\n   - **Total 8's in hundreds place:** 0\n   - **Difference in hundreds place:** 89 - 0 = 89\n\n4. **Total Difference:**\n   - Summing the differences from each place:\n     - Units: 0\n     - Tens: 2\n     - Hundreds: 89\n   - **Total difference:** 0 + 2 + 89 = 91\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe digit 4 is printed 91 more times than the digit 8 in the page numbers of the book.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " I need to solve this step by step, so let me think it through carefully.\n\nFirst, I know that each page is numbered from 1 to 488. So, every number from 1 up to 488 is printed once as a page number. The task is to count how many times the digit '4' appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit '8' appears, then find the difference between these two counts.\n\nI remember that to count the number of times a particular digit appears in a range of numbers, we can break it down by the units place, tens place, hundreds place, etc., and calculate the occurrences in each place separately. Let me try to apply this method here.\n\nLet's start by considering each digit position separately: units, tens, hundreds, and maybe even thousands, although since 488 is less than 1000, the thousands place won't be relevant here.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the number of 4's in each position:\n\n1. **Units place:** In every set of ten consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit '4' appears exactly once in the units place. So, for the units place, the number of 4's would be the total number of complete tens in 488. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, there are 48 complete tens. But wait, that might not be entirely accurate because from 1 to 488, the number of times the units digit cycles through 0-9 is 48 full cycles (each cycle being 10 numbers) and then an additional 8 numbers (481-488). So, in each full cycle of 10, there's one '4' in the units place. So, 48 cycles would give 48 '4's, and then in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so no '4' there. So, total '4's in units place: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place. For every hundred numbers, the digit '4' appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is '4' for all 10 numbers. So, in 100 numbers, there are 10 '4's in the tens place. Now, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these contributes 10 '4's in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40 '4's. Now, we also have the 400-488 range. In this range, the tens digit is '4' from 400-409, which is 10 numbers, so that's another 10 '4's. So, total '4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, the hundreds digit is '4' for 100 numbers: 400-499. But since our book only goes up to 488, it's 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit '4' appears 89 times.\n\nWait, but actually, in the hundreds place, each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of '4', so that's correct, 89 times.\n\nNow, let me check if I'm not double-counting. Each position is separate, so units, tens, and hundreds are all independent, so adding them up is correct.\n\nSo, total '4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, for the units place: from 1 to 488, how many times does '4' appear in the units place?\n\nWell, every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one '4' in the units place, so 48 '4's. Then, in the last partial set, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so no '4's. So, 48 '4's in units place. That's correct.\n\nTens place: in each hundred, 10 '4's in the tens place, so 4 hundreds (1-400) would give 4*10=40 '4's. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is '4' from 400-409, which is 10 numbers, so another 10 '4's. So, total 50 '4's in tens place. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a '4' in the hundreds place, so 89 '4's. So, total '4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's do the same for '8's.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to '4's, in every 10 numbers, '8' appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many '8's in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one '8', so 48 '8's. Then, in the last partial set, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so '8' appears once more (at 488). So, total '8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, for the tens place, '8' appears in the tens digit for 10 consecutive numbers every hundred. So, in each hundred, there are 10 '8's in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). Now, how many hundreds are there in 488? 4 full hundreds (1-400). So, each hundred contributes 10 '8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40 '8's. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is '8' from 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so that's 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, 480-489 is 10 numbers, but since we stop at 488, it's 9 numbers. Wait, but actually, 480-489 is 10 numbers, but 488 is the last page, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers. Wait, no: 480 is the first, then 481, 482,... up to 488, which is 9 numbers after 480, so total 9 numbers? Wait, no, 480 is included, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (including both 480 and 488). Wait, but 480 to 488 is 9 numbers? Wait, 488 - 480 = 8, so 9 numbers. Hmm, but in the tens place, from 480-489, the tens digit is '8' for all 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, we have 9 numbers where the tens digit is '8'. So, that's 9 '8's in the tens place in the 400-488 range. So, total '8's in tens place: 40 (from the first 400 pages) + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 1 to 400, each hundred contributes 10 '8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit '8' occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 '8's. So, total '8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The digit '8' appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no '8's in the hundreds place. So, '8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nWait, but 488 is less than 800, so the hundreds digit never reaches '8'. So, '8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total '8's: units place 49 + tens place 49 + hundreds place 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nWait, let me double-check:\n\n- Units place: 48 full tens (each contributing one '8') plus one more in 488, so 49.\n- Tens place: 40 from the first 400 pages, plus 9 from 480-488, total 49.\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total '8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, for '4's, I had 187 '4's. So, the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations.\n\nWait, for '4's:\n\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187.\n\nFor '8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems correct. But let me check again for '8's in the tens place.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does '8' appear in the tens place?\n\nIn each hundred, from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n\nSo, each hundred contributes 10 '8's in the tens place, except the last hundred, which only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 '8's.\n\nSo, 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 '8's, except the last one which contributes 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for units place, '8's: 48 full tens, each contributing one '8', and then in 488, another '8', so 49.\n\nSo, total '8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, '4's: 187, '8's:98, so 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for '4's again.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, how many numbers? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, each of these 89 numbers has a hundreds digit of '4', so 89 '4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for '4's again.\n\nIn the first 400 pages, how many '4's in the tens place?\n\nEach hundred contributes 10 '4's in the tens place, so 4 hundreds would be 4*10=40.\n\nThen, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit '4' occurs from 400-409, which is 10 numbers, so 10 '4's.\n\nSo, total '4's in tens place: 40 +10=50.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nUnits place '4's: 48.\n\nSo, total '4's: 48 +50 +89=187.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 98=89.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, perhaps using a formula or a different counting method to cross-verify.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of each digit position separately and calculate the number of '4's and '8's in each, then sum them up.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFor each position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of '4's and '8's.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- For '4's: as calculated, 48.\n- For '8's: 49.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For '4's: 50.\n- For '8's:49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- For '4's:89.\n- For '8's:0.\n\nSo, adding them up:\n\n'4's: 48 +50 +89=187.\n\n'8's:49 +49 +0=98.\n\nDifference:187-98=89.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because the difference is quite large. Let me see if there's a way to cross-validate this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write a small program or use a different counting method, but since I can't write a program right now, I'll try to think of another way.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that for each digit position, the number of times a digit appears can be calculated using the formula:\n\nFor a given digit d and position p (units=1, tens=2, hundreds=3), the count is:\n\nhigher = number formed by digits higher than p.\n\ncurrent = digit at position p.\n\nlower = number formed by digits lower than p.\n\ncount = higher * 10^(p-1) + (if current > d, add 10^(p-1)) + (if current == d, add lower +1).\n\nWait, but this might be more complicated, but perhaps it can help verify.\n\nLet me try to apply this formula for '4's and '8's in each position.\n\nStarting with units place (p=1):\n\nFor '4's:\n\nhigher = 488 / 10 = 48 (integer division).\n\ncurrent = 488 % 10 =8.\n\nlower = 0.\n\nSo, count = 48 * 10^0 + (if 8 >4, add 10^0) + (if 8==4, add 0+1). Since 8>4, count =48 +1=49. Wait, but earlier I had 48 '4's in units place. Hmm, this seems conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misapplying the formula.\n\nWait, the formula is:\n\ncount = higher * 10^(p-1) + (if current > d, add 10^(p-1)) + (if current ==d, add lower +1).\n\nSo, for units place, p=1, d=4.\n\nhigher = 488 // 10 =48.\n\ncurrent = 488 %10=8.\n\nlower =0.\n\nSo,\n\ncount =48*1 + (8>4 ? 1 :0) + (8==4 ? (0+1) :0).\n\nSo, 48 +1 +0=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place '4's were 48. So, discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, according to this formula, units place '4's would be 49, but I thought it was 48.\n\nWait, let me check.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many '4's in units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, '4' appears once in units place.\n\nFrom 1-480, that's 480 numbers, so 480/10=48 '4's.\n\nThen, from 481-488, units digits go from 1-8, so no '4's.\n\nSo, total '4's in units place:48.\n\nBut according to the formula, it's 49. So, there's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula counts 0 as a page, but there is no page 0, so maybe the formula needs adjustment.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is counting from 0 to 488, which would include page 0, but our problem starts at page 1.\n\nSo, perhaps the formula's count is 49, but actual count is 48 because page 0 doesn't exist.\n\nSimilarly, for '8's in units place, the formula would give:\n\nhigher=48, current=8, lower=0.\n\ncount=48*1 + (8>8? 0) + (8==8? (0+1))=48+0+1=49.\n\nWhich matches our earlier count of 49 '8's in units place.\n\nSo, perhaps the formula is correct, but in our case, since we start at page 1, the count for '4's in units place is 48, not 49.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the formula gives the count from 0 to N, so we need to adjust for that.\n\nIn our problem, we're starting from 1, so for units place, '4's would be 48, not 49.\n\nSimilarly, for '8's, the formula gives 49, which matches our count because page 488 is included.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is correct, but when N is not a multiple of 10, the higher part is floor(N/10), and the current digit is N%10.\n\nSo, for '4's in units place, from 1 to 488, the number of '4's is equal to the number of complete tens (48) plus whether the last partial ten includes a '4' in the units place. Since the last page is 488, the units digit is 8, so no '4's in the units place in the last partial ten. So, total '4's in units place:48.\n\nSimilarly, for '8's in units place, the last partial ten includes 8, so we add 1, making it 49.\n\nSo, perhaps the formula is correct, but in our case, since we're starting from 1, the '4's in units place are 48, and '8's are 49.\n\nSo, perhaps I should trust my initial count for '4's in units place as 48.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place.\n\nLet me apply the formula for '4's in tens place.\n\np=2 (tens place), d=4.\n\nhigher = 488 // 100 =4.\n\ncurrent = (488 //10) %10=8.\n\nlower =488 %10=8.\n\ncount = higher *10^(2-1) + (if current >4, add 10^(2-1)) + (if current ==4, add lower +1).\n\nSo,\n\ncount=4*10 + (8>4 ? 10) + (8==4 ? (8+1)).\n\nSo, 4*10=40.\n\n8>4, so add 10.\n\n8==4? No, so add 0.\n\nTotal count=40+10=50.\n\nWhich matches our earlier count of 50 '4's in tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for '8's in tens place, p=2, d=8.\n\nhigher=488//100=4.\n\ncurrent=(488//10)%10=8.\n\nlower=488%10=8.\n\ncount=4*10 + (8>8? 0) + (8==8? (8+1)).\n\nSo, 4*10=40.\n\n8>8? No.\n\n8==8? Yes, so add 8+1=9.\n\nTotal count=40+9=49.\n\nWhich matches our earlier count of 49 '8's in tens place.\n\nNow, for hundreds place, '4's.\n\np=3, d=4.\n\nhigher=488//1000=0.\n\ncurrent=(488//100)%10=4.\n\nlower=488%100=88.\n\ncount=0*100 + (4>4? 0) + (4==4? (88+1)).\n\nSo, 0 +0 +89=89.\n\nWhich matches our earlier count of 89 '4's in hundreds place.\n\nFor '8's in hundreds place, p=3, d=8.\n\nhigher=488//1000=0.\n\ncurrent=(488//100)%10=4.\n\nlower=488%100=88.\n\ncount=0*100 + (4>8? 0) + (4==8? 0)=0.\n\nWhich matches our earlier count of 0 '8's in hundreds place.\n\nSo, using this formula, we get:\n\n'4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89, total=187.\n\n'8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0, total=98.\n\nDifference:187-98=89.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I applied the formula to units place for '4's, I got 49, but our actual count is 48 because we start from page 1. So, perhaps the formula counts from 0 to N, and we need to adjust for that.\n\nIn our problem, the pages start at 1, so for units place '4's, the formula gives 49, but actual count is 48 because page 0 doesn't exist. Similarly, for '8's, the formula gives 49, which is correct because page 488 is included.\n\nWait, but in the formula, for units place '4's, higher=48, current=8, so count=48*1 + (8>4?1) + (8==4?0)=48+1=49. But since we don't have page 0, the actual count is 48.\n\nSimilarly, for '8's, higher=48, current=8, so count=48 +1=49, which is correct because page 488 is included.\n\nSo, perhaps the formula counts from 0 to N, so for '4's in units place, we have to subtract 1 if the last digit is >=4, but in our case, since the last digit is 8, which is greater than 4, we subtract 1.\n\nWait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is correct, and the initial count from 1 to N is the same as from 0 to N-1, so perhaps we need to adjust.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to stick with our initial counting method, which gave us 48 '4's in units place and 49 '8's in units place, leading to a total of 187 '4's and 98 '8's, difference 89.\n\nSo, after carefully going through the problem using two different methods and cross-verifying, I'm confident that the number of '4's printed is 187, and the number of '8's is 98, so the difference is 89.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{89}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we need to count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n### Counting the number of 4's:\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one '4' in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 '4's.\n   - The last partial set (481-488) does not include a '4' in the units place.\n   - Total '4's in units place: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers contribute 10 '4's in the tens place.\n   - There are 4 complete sets of 100 in 488, contributing 40 '4's.\n   - The range 400-488 contributes an additional 10 '4's in the tens place (400-409).\n   - Total '4's in tens place: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The range 400-488 contributes 89 '4's in the hundreds place.\n   - Total '4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\nTotal '4's: \\(48 + 50 + 89 = 187\\).\n\n### Counting the number of 8's:\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one '8' in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 '8's.\n   - The last partial set (481-488) includes one '8' (at 488).\n   - Total '8's in units place: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers contribute 10 '8's in the tens place.\n   - There are 4 complete sets of 100 in 488, contributing 40 '8's.\n   - The range 400-488 contributes an additional 9 '8's in the tens place (480-488).\n   - Total '8's in tens place: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - There are no '8's in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total '8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal '8's: \\(49 + 49 + 0 = 98\\).\n\n### Difference:\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\(187 - 98 = 89\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{89}\n\\]"

    "text": " I need to solve this step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should figure out how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488. Then, I'll do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by understanding how digits are distributed in page numbers. Page numbers can be 1-digit, 2-digit, or 3-digit numbers. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers can be 1-digit (1-9), 2-digit (10-99), 3-digit (100-488).\n\nI think I should break down the counting of 4's and 8's into units, tens, and hundreds places separately because each position contributes differently to the total count.\n\nLet me first consider the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each block of 10 numbers. For example, from 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears in blocks of 100. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred.\n\nThe same logic applies to the hundreds place, but it's only relevant when the page number is three digits. In this case, the hundreds digit cycles every 1000 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nWait, but page numbers start at 1, so the hundreds digit starts at 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, etc., up to 4 for 400-488.\n\nI should probably handle each digit place separately and then sum up the counts.\n\nLet me start with counting the number of 4's.\n\nFirst, count the number of 4's in the units place.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nIn every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-488, there are 488 / 10 = 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks and then 8 more numbers (481-488). In those 8 numbers, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so no additional 4's in the units place. So, total 4's in units place: 48.\n\nNext, count the number of 4's in the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. So, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, in 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10 times, and so on.\n\nSo, how many hundreds are there in 488? Up to 400, so 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Then, from 401-488.\n\nWait, but 488 is less than 500, so we don't have a full fifth hundred. Let me break it down:\n\nFrom 1-400, there are 4 hundreds. Each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nNow, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles again. Let's see, the tens digit in 401-488 is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, ..., up to 8 for 481-490, but wait, 488 is less than 490, so the tens digit in 481-488 is 8, but we only go up to 488, so how many times does 4 appear in the tens place in 401-488?\n\nWait, no, 401-488: the tens digit is 0 in 401-410, 1 in 411-420, ..., 8 in 481-490. But since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, the digit 4 in the tens place would occur in 441-450, right? Because 440-449 would have 4 in the hundreds and tens place, but wait, let me think.\n\nWait, no, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, but wait, 400 is already included in the previous count (1-400). So, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times. But 440 is included in 401-488, so that's 10 more 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 440 is part of the 401-488 range, so yes, that's correct. So, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in the tens place: 4 (hundreds) *10=40 plus 10 in 401-488, so 50.\n\nWait, but wait, from 1-400, we have 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 40. Then from 401-488, another 10 in 440-449, so total 50.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, let's check if that's accurate. From 1-400, 40 4's in tens place. From 401-488, 10 more, so 50 total.\n\nWait, but 488 is 488, so 440-449 is within 401-488, yes.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. How many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place?\n\nIn 1-488, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but wait, that's not correct because in the hundreds place, each digit represents a 100's place. So, for example, in 400, the hundreds digit is 4, and it's the same for 401, 402, etc., up to 488. So, the number of times 4 appears in the hundreds place is the number of page numbers from 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in the hundreds place: 89.\n\nNow, let me sum up the 4's:\n\nUnits place: 48\n\nTens place: 50\n\nHundreds place: 89\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, from 1-488, the hundreds digit 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nIn the tens place, from 1-488, every hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so 4 hundreds (1-400) gives 40, and then in 401-488, another 10 in 440-449, so 50 total.\n\nUnits place: every 10 numbers, 1 occurrence, so 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full occurrences, and in the last partial block (481-488), the units digit doesn't reach 4 again, so 48 total.\n\nSo, 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\nFrom 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nSame as 4's: in every block of 10, 8 appears once. So, 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1-8, so 8 appears once more (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, that's different from 4's because in the last block, 488 ends with 8, so we have an extra 8 in the units place.\n\nSo, units place 8's: 49.\n\nNext, tens place:\n\nIn the tens place, 8 appears in blocks of 100, specifically in the tens digit as 8. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n\nSo, from 1-488, how many hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nNow, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489. But since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in 401-488.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, let me confirm: from 1-400, 4*10=40. From 401-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 more. So, 40+9=49.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nHow many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? From 1-488, the hundreds digit is 8 only from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:49\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's:187, total 8's:98.\n\nDifference:187 -98=89.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\nUnits place:48\n\nTens place:50\n\nHundreds place:89\n\nTotal:48+50=98, 98+89=187.\n\nCounting 8's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:49\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:187-98=89.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's is 89 more than the number of 8's.\n\nBut let me think again: when counting the hundreds place for 4's, I considered that from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nFor the tens place, 4's: in each hundred, 10 times, so 4 hundreds give 40, and then in 401-488, another 10 in 440-449, so 50 total.\n\nUnits place:48.\n\nFor 8's, units place:49, tens place:49, so 98 total.\n\nYes, so the difference is 187-98=89.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. When counting the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, correct.\n\nBut when counting the tens place for 4's, in 440-449, that's within 401-488, so that's 10 more 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but in 440-449, the hundreds digit is 4, and the tens digit is 4, so each of those numbers contributes both a 4 in the hundreds and tens place. So, when I counted the hundreds place, I included all 400-488, which includes 440-449, and when I counted the tens place, I included 440-449 again. So, that's correct because each digit is counted separately.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, 440-449 would have units digits 0-9, so the 4 in the units place occurs once in 444, which is already counted in the units place count.\n\nWait, no, in the units place, I counted 48, which includes all 4's in the units place from 1-488, including 444, which is part of 440-449. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my counts are accurate.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 89.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when I counted the tens place for 4's, I included 440-449 as part of 401-488, which is correct because that's where the tens digit is 4. So, that adds 10 more 4's in the tens place beyond the 40 from the first 400 pages.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's why units place 8's are 49 instead of 48.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every block of 10 numbers contributes one 4.\n   - Total blocks: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8).\n   - Units place 4's: 48.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every block of 100 numbers contributes 10 4's.\n   - From 1-400: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - From 401-488: 440-449 contributes another 10.\n   - Tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - From 400-488: 89 numbers.\n   - Hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every block of 10 numbers contributes one 8.\n   - Total blocks: 48, plus one more in 488.\n   - Units place 8's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every block of 100 numbers contributes 10 8's.\n   - From 1-400: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - From 401-488: 480-488 contributes 9.\n   - Tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers in the 800s.\n   - Hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Each page is printed once, starting from 1 and ending at 488.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by understanding how digits are counted in page numbers. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since 488 is a three-digit number, I'll need to consider all three-digit page numbers up to 488.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to break down the counting by each digit position: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position separately and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits go from 1 to 0, then 11 to 20, and so on. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in each cycle of 10. So, for the units place, the number of times a digit appears can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then considering any remainder.\n\nBut wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. That means there are 48 complete cycles of 10 pages and then 8 extra pages (481 to 488). In each cycle, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 appears once as well. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 times 1 plus any additional 4's in the remaining 8 pages. Similarly for 8's.\n\nWait, no. Let me correct that. Actually, in each cycle of 10, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so each digit appears exactly once. Therefore, for the units place, the number of 4's is the number of complete cycles times 1, plus any additional 4's in the incomplete cycle.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, it's the same approach.\n\nSo, for the units place:\n\nNumber of 4's = (488 // 10) * 1 + (1 if the units digit in the remaining pages is >=4 else 0). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, let me think again.\n\nActually, for the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in each cycle. So, the total number of times a digit appears in the units place is (total pages // 10) * 1 + (if the remaining pages are greater than or equal to the digit, then 1 else 0). But I think that's not entirely accurate.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to calculate how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to page N is equal to:\n\nnumber_of_cycles = N // 10\nremainder = N % 10\n\ncount = number_of_cycles * 1\nif d <= remainder:\n    count += 1\n\nSo, for d=4:\n\nnumber_of_cycles = 488 // 10 = 48\nremainder = 488 % 10 = 8\n\nSince 4 <=8, count = 48 *1 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8:\n\ncount = 48 *1 +1=49.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 488 is the last page, and the units digit goes up to 8. So, for 8, the count would be 48 full cycles (each contributing one 8 in the units place) plus one more in the remaining pages because 8 is within 0-8. So, 48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 4, since 4 <=8, it's 48+1=49.\n\nWait, but that would mean both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place. But that doesn't make sense because in the last partial cycle, the units digits go up to 8, so 4 appears once, and 8 appears once. So, both counts are 49.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller number. Suppose N=15. Then, for units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: 1 (from 4) +1 (from 14) =2.\n\nUsing the formula: 15//10=1, remainder=5. Since 4<=5, count=1+1=2. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's: 15//10=1, remainder=5. Since 8>5, count=1+0=1. So, only 8 appears once in units place up to 15, which is correct (page 8).\n\nWait, so in the formula, if d <= remainder, we add 1, else 0.\n\nSo, for d=8 in N=15: 8>5, so count=1.\n\nSo, in our case, for d=4: 4<=8, so count=48+1=49.\n\nFor d=8: 8<=8, so count=48+1=49.\n\nWait, but in N=15, 8 appears once in units place, but in N=18, it would be 1 full cycle (10 pages) with 8 appearing once, and then in the remaining 8 pages (11-18), the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once more, making it 2 times. So, for N=18, using the formula: 18//10=1, remainder=8. So, count=1+1=2, which is correct.\n\nSo, for N=488, both 4 and 8 in units place would have 49 occurrences. So, units place: 49 each.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, each digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each (from 00-09, 10-19, ..., 90-99). But since we're starting from page 1, the first 9 pages (1-9) have 0 in the tens place.\n\nSo, the number of times a digit d appears in the tens place is calculated as:\n\nnumber_of_hundreds = N // 100\nremainder = N % 100\n\ncount = number_of_hundreds * 10\nif d < 10:\n    count += min(10, remainder +1) if d < (remainder //10) else 0\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is:\n\nEach time the tens digit cycles, it's 10 pages per digit. So, for each hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nBut wait, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, for each hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, for N=488:\n\nnumber_of_hundreds = 488 // 100 = 4\nremainder = 488 % 100 = 88\n\nSo, for the tens place:\n\nFor digits 0-9, each appears 4*10=40 times in the tens place up to page 400.\n\nNow, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), we need to count how many times each digit appears in the tens place.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8.\n\nWait, no. Let me think: 401-410: tens digit is 0 (but actually, 401 is 4 0 1, so tens digit is 0; 410 is 4 1 0, so tens digit is 1? Wait, no, 401 is 401, so the tens digit is 0 (since it's the second digit). Wait, no, wait: 401 is 4-0-1, so the hundreds digit is 4, tens digit is 0, units digit is 1. Similarly, 402 is 4-0-2, up to 409: 4-0-9. Then 410 is 4-1-0, so tens digit is 1.\n\nWait, so from 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for 8, which appears only 9 times because 488 is the last page.\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nFrom 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 numbers)\n411-420: tens digit 1 (10 numbers)\n...\n471-480: tens digit 7 (10 numbers)\n481-488: tens digit 8 (8 numbers, since 488 is the end)\n\nSo, for the tens digit in the remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n\nDigits 0-7 each appear 10 times in the tens place, and digit 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, for the tens place:\n\nTotal count for each digit d:\n\nIf d is 0-7: 4*10 +10=50\nIf d=8: 4*10 +8=48\nIf d=9: 4*10=40 (since we don't reach 500)\n\nWait, but we're only going up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4, and the tens digit goes up to 8.\n\nWait, let me correct that.\n\nActually, for the tens place:\n\nEach hundred (1-100, 101-200, ..., 401-500) contributes 10 occurrences of each digit 0-9 in the tens place, except the last partial hundred.\n\nSo, up to 400, we have 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 times each digit 0-9 in the tens place, so 4*10=40 times per digit.\n\nThen, from 401-488, which is 88 pages, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-488). So, for each digit 0-7, they appear 10 times each in the tens place, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nTherefore, total counts for tens place:\n\nFor d=0: 4*10 +10=50\nd=1: 4*10 +10=50\n...\nd=7: 4*10 +10=50\nd=8: 4*10 +8=48\nd=9: 4*10=40 (since we don't reach 490-499)\n\nWait, but in our case, we're only going up to 488, so the tens digits go up to 8 in the last partial hundred.\n\nSo, for the tens place, the count for each digit is:\n\nd=0: 50\nd=1:50\n...\nd=7:50\nd=8:48\nd=9:40\n\nSo, for digit 4 in the tens place: 50 times\nFor digit 8 in the tens place:48 times\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, each page number from 1-488 has a hundreds digit of 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488).\n\nSo, the digit in the hundreds place is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, etc.\n\nSo, the number of times a digit d appears in the hundreds place is:\n\nIf d=0: 0 (since pages start at 1)\nd=1: 100-199: 100 pages\nd=2:200-299:100 pages\nd=3:300-399:100 pages\nd=4:400-488:89 pages (since 488-400+1=89)\n\nWait, 400-488 is 89 pages because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89.\n\nWait, let me confirm: from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 pages.\n\nSo, for the hundreds place:\n\nd=0:0\nd=1:100\nd=2:100\nd=3:100\nd=4:89\n\nSo, for digit 4 in the hundreds place:89 times\nFor digit 8 in the hundreds place:0 times, since 800-899 isn't included.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in all three places.\n\nFirst, for digit 4:\n\nUnits place:49\nTens place:50\nHundreds place:89\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nFor digit 8:\n\nUnits place:49\nTens place:48\nHundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (number of 4's) minus 97 (number of 8's) =91.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me double-check the calculations.\n\nUnits place:\n\n4's:49\n8's:49\n\nTens place:\n\n4's:50\n8's:48\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's:89\n8's:0\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97\nDifference:188-97=91\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Each page is numbered once, starting from 1 and ending at 488. I need to find out how many times the digit 4 appears and how many times the digit 8 appears, and then subtract the two to find the difference.\n\nFirst, I think I should break this down by looking at the units place and the tens place separately because each digit can appear in either position. Maybe I can calculate the number of times 4 appears in the units place and then in the tens place, and do the same for 8. Then, I can add those up for each digit and find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4. I'll consider the units place first. In a sequence of numbers from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units digit? Well, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0 to 9. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 complete sets of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (since 48*10=480, so from 481 to 488 is 8 numbers).\n\nIn each complete set of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.). So, for 48 complete sets, that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits are 1 through 8, so 4 doesn't appear here. Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48.\n\nNext, I'll look at the tens place for the digit 4. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each block of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.). How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial block from 401 to 488.\n\nIn each complete block, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 blocks, that's 4*10=40 times. Now, in the partial block from 401 to 488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-409, then 8 for 480-488. Wait, no, actually, 401-409 would have a tens digit of 0, and 410-419 would have a tens digit of 1, but since we're only going up to 488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8 in the 400s. But the digit 4 in the tens place would only appear in 440-449. So, from 401 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in the numbers 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 times. Therefore, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but hold on. The partial block is from 401 to 488. The tens digit for 401-409 is 0, and for 410-419 it's 1, and so on up to 480-488 where it's 8. So, in the 400s, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the digit 4 in the tens place occurs exactly once in this partial block, which is from 440 to 449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 more. So, total 4's in tens place is 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but 488 is less than 500, so in the 400s, the last number is 488, so 440-449 is fully included because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, that's correct, 10 more.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units place (48) plus tens place (50), which is 98.\n\nNow, let me check if I did that right. Wait, no, wait. Because in the tens place, each block of 100 contributes 10 4's, and there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the 401-488 block, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10, so total 50. So, 48 (units) + 50 (tens) = 98 4's.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4, every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1 through 8, so 8 appears once more in 488. So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, the tens place for 8. Again, in each block of 100, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Then, in the partial block from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 here, so that's 9 times. Wait, but 480-489 is 10 numbers, but since we stop at 488, it's 9 numbers. So, does that mean 9 more 8's in the tens place? Or does it count as a full 10 because 480 is included?\n\nWait, no, 480 is included, but 488 is the last page. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488). So, the tens digit is 8 in each of these, so that's 9 times. So, the total number of 8's in the tens place is 40 (from the complete blocks) + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: in the 401-488 block, the tens digit is 8 starting at 480, which is within 401-488. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, 9 more 8's in the tens place.\n\nTherefore, total number of 8's is units place (49) + tens place (49) = 98.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 4's and 8's would be the same, but the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's, so maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculations.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits place: 48 times.\n\nTens place: 50 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 98.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 complete sets (1-480) each contributing 1, so 48. Then, from 481-488, units digit is 8 in 488, so +1, total 49.\n\nTens place: 4 complete blocks (1-400) each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so +9, total 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, so both 4's and 8's are 98? That seems odd because the problem is asking how many more 4's than 8's, implying that there's a difference. Maybe I made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me recount the 8's in the tens place.\n\nIn the 401-488 block, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times the digit 8 appears in the tens place.\n\nSo, 40 (from complete blocks) + 9 = 49.\n\nUnits place: 48 +1=49.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's:\n\nUnits place: 48.\n\nTens place: 50.\n\nTotal 4's: 98.\n\nSo, that would mean that 4's and 8's are equal, which would make the difference zero. But that seems unlikely. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me check the 4's in the tens place again.\n\nIn the 401-488 block, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, 4 blocks before that, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. So, total 4's in tens place: 40+10=50.\n\nUnits place: 48.\n\nTotal 4's: 98.\n\nFor 8's, same calculation: 49+49=98.\n\nHmm. So, perhaps the answer is zero. But let me think again.\n\nWait, in the 401-488 block, the tens digit for 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 40+9=49.\n\nUnits place: 48+1=49.\n\nTotal 8's: 98.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's, 50+48=98.\n\nWait, so the number of 4's and 8's are equal, so the difference is zero.\n\nBut that seems counterintuitive. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me check the units place for 8 again.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more in 488. So, 48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in units place, it's 48, because 488/10=48.8, but 488 is not a multiple of 4, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is within 480-488. Wait, no, 484 is within 480-488, but 484 is the last 4 in the units place before 488. So, from 1-488, the units digit 4 appears 48 times, same as 8, but wait, no, because 488 is included, so 8 appears once more in the units place. So, 48+1=49 for 8, but for 4, it's 48 because 488 is not a 4 in the units place.\n\nWait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, 488 is the last page. So, the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears in 488. But 4 doesn't appear in the units place after 484, which is 484. So, from 1-488, the units digit 4 appears 48 times, and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nWait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, maybe I made a mistake in the 4's units place count.\n\nLet me recast this.\n\nThe units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nIt's the number of times 4 is the units digit, which is every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. Now, 484 is 48*10 +4, so 484 is the 48th occurrence of 4 in the units place. The next would be 494, which is beyond 488, so 48 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the units place, it's 8,18,28,...,488. 488 is 48*10 +8, so that's the 49th occurrence because 488 is included. So, 49 times.\n\nSo, units place: 4's=48, 8's=49.\n\nNow, for the tens place:\n\nFor 4's, in each block of 100, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. So, from 1-400, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10, so total 50.\n\nFor 8's, in each block of 100, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 80-89,180-189,...,480-489. But since we only go up to 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, from 1-400, 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers (480-488), so total 40+9=49.\n\nTherefore, total 4's: 48 (units) +50 (tens)=98.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)=98.\n\nWait, so that brings us back to 98 each, so the difference is zero.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that in units place, 8's are 49 and 4's are 48, but in tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 49, so total 4's=98, 8's=98.\n\nWait, that's correct. So, the number of 4's and 8's are equal, so the difference is zero.\n\nBut the problem says \"how many more 4's are printed than 8's?\" So, the answer would be zero.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit odd. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check:\n\nIn the 401-488 block, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times the digit 8 appears in the tens place. So, 40 (from 1-400) +9=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, in 401-488, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, 40+10=50.\n\nSo, 4's: units=48, tens=50, total=98.\n\n8's: units=49, tens=49, total=98.\n\nSo, yes, they are equal. Therefore, the difference is zero.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to see if my method is correct.\n\nSuppose we have a book with 88 pages. Let's count 4's and 8's.\n\nUnits place:\n\n4's: 4,14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84. That's 9 times.\n\n8's:8,18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88. That's 9 times.\n\nTens place:\n\n4's:40-49:10 times.\n\n8's:80-88:9 times.\n\nSo, total 4's:9+10=19.\n\nTotal 8's:9+9=18.\n\nDifference:19-18=1.\n\nWait, so in this case, 4's are more than 8's by 1.\n\nBut according to my previous method, for 88 pages:\n\nUnits place 4's: floor(88/10)=8, but 88/10=8.8, so 8 complete sets, each contributing one 4, so 8. Then, in the last partial set (81-88), the units digit 4 doesn't appear, so total 8.\n\nSimilarly, units place 8's: floor(88/10)=8, and in the last partial set (81-88), 88 has 8 in units place, so total 8+1=9.\n\nTens place 4's: floor(88/100)=0 complete blocks, but in 40-49, which is within 88, so 10 times.\n\nTens place 8's: floor(88/100)=0 complete blocks, but in 80-88, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nTotal 4's:8+10=18.\n\nTotal 8's:9+9=18.\n\nWait, but in reality, when I counted manually, I got 19 4's and 18 8's. So, my method is undercounting.\n\nWait, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, in the units place for 4's, from 1-88, the units digit 4 appears in 4,14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84. That's 9 times, not 8. So, my method was wrong.\n\nAh, I see. So, the correct way is to calculate the number of times the digit appears in each position, considering the full range.\n\nSo, perhaps my initial approach was flawed because I was using floor division, but I need to adjust for whether the last partial block includes the digit.\n\nSo, let's correct the method.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is equal to:\n\nnumber = (N // 10) * 1 + min(max(N % 10 - d, 0), 9)\n\nWait, perhaps a better formula is:\n\nFor units digit d, the count is:\n\ncount = (N // 10) * 1 + (1 if (N % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nBut only if d != 0, because 0 is a special case.\n\nWait, actually, for units digit d, the number of times it appears from 1 to N is:\n\nfull_cycles = N // 10\n\ncount = full_cycles\n\nif N % 10 >= d:\n    count += 1\n\nBut if d is 0, it's a bit different because 0 doesn't appear in the units place for numbers 1 to N.\n\nWait, but in our case, d is 4 or 8, so not zero.\n\nSo, for units digit 4:\n\ncount = (488 // 10) = 48 full cycles.\n\nThen, since 488 % 10 = 8, which is >=4, so add 1.\n\nSo, total units place 4's:48+1=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm.\n\nWait, but in reality, from 1-488, the units digit 4 appears in 4,14,24,...,484. So, 484 is the last one, which is the 48th occurrence. Wait, but 488//10=48, and 488%10=8 >=4, so add 1, making it 49. But wait, 484 is the 48th, and 494 would be the next, which is beyond 488, so it shouldn't be counted.\n\nWait, so perhaps the formula is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\ncount = (N // 10) if d !=0 else (N // 10 -1)\n\nBut I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nFrom 1 to N, the number of times digit d appears in the units place is equal to:\n\nnumber_of_times = (N // 10) * 1 + (1 if (N % 10 >= d) else 0)\n\nBut only if d !=0.\n\nSo, for d=4:\n\n488//10=48\n\n488%10=8 >=4, so +1.\n\nTotal=49.\n\nBut in reality, from 1-488, the units digit 4 appears at 4,14,24,...,484. That's 48 times because 484 is 48*10 +4, so the 48th occurrence. 494 would be the next, which is beyond 488, so it's not included. So, why does the formula give 49?\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is counting 484 as the 48th, but 488 is the 48th multiple of 10, so 48*10=480, so from 481-488, the units digit 4 doesn't appear again. So, the formula is overcounting by 1.\n\nWait, maybe the formula should be:\n\ncount = (N // 10) if (N % 10 >= d) else (N // 10)\n\nBut only if d !=0.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct count is:\n\ncount = (N // 10) + (1 if (N % 10 >= d) else 0) - (1 if d ==0 else 0)\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's take the example of N=88 and d=4.\n\nN//10=8\n\nN%10=8 >=4, so +1, total=9.\n\nWhich matches the manual count.\n\nSimilarly, for N=488 and d=4:\n\nN//10=48\n\nN%10=8 >=4, so +1, total=49.\n\nBut in reality, from 1-488, the units digit 4 appears 48 times because 484 is the last one, which is 48th.\n\nWait, so perhaps the formula is correct, but my manual count was wrong.\n\nWait, 484 is the 48th occurrence, and 488 is the 488th page, so the units digit 4 appears at 4,14,...,484, which is 48 times, but according to the formula, it's 49. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let me list them:\n\nFrom 1-488, the units digit 4 appears at:\n\n4,14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94,\n\n104,114,124,134,144,154,164,174,184,194,\n\n204,214,224,234,244,254,264,274,284,294,\n\n304,314,324,334,344,354,364,374,384,394,\n\n404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484.\n\nWait, that's 48 numbers, right? Because each hundred contributes 10, and there are 4 hundreds (1-400), so 4*10=40, then from 401-488, the units digit 4 appears at 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 more, making it 49.\n\nWait, so I was wrong earlier; the units digit 4 does appear 49 times, not 48. So, the formula is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place:\n\nFrom 1-488, the units digit 8 appears at 8,18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,\n\n108,118,128,138,148,158,168,178,188,198,\n\n208,218,228,238,248,258,268,278,288,298,\n\n308,318,328,338,348,358,368,378,388,398,\n\n408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488.\n\nThat's 49 times.\n\nWait, so in the units place, both 4's and 8's appear 49 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 48, but that was a mistake.\n\nSo, units place:\n\n4's:49\n\n8's:49\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4's:\n\nFrom 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in:\n\n40-49:10 numbers,\n\n140-149:10,\n\n240-249:10,\n\n340-349:10,\n\n440-449:10.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers.\n\nSo, total 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4 blocks, but actually, from 1-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's included.\n\nSo, tens place for 4's:50.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nTens digit 8 appears in:\n\n80-89:10,\n\n180-189:10,\n\n280-289:10,\n\n380-389:10,\n\n480-488:9.\n\nWait, so from 1-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, total 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nSo, tens place:\n\n4's:50\n\n8's:49\n\nTherefore, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens)=99.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 99-98=1.\n\nWait, so earlier I was wrong because I didn't consider that the tens digit 4 appears in 5 blocks, not 4.\n\nWait, let me clarify.\n\nFrom 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in:\n\n- 40-49:10 numbers (pages 40-49)\n\n- 140-149:10 (140-149)\n\n- 240-249:10 (240-249)\n\n- 340-349:10 (340-349)\n\n- 440-449:10 (440-449)\n\nThat's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place:\n\n- 80-89:10\n\n- 180-189:10\n\n- 280-289:10\n\n- 380-389:10\n\n- 480-488:9\n\nSo, total 49.\n\nTherefore, total 4's:49+50=99\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98\n\nDifference:99-98=1.\n\nSo, the answer is 1 more 4 than 8.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was zero. So, where was I wrong?\n\nI think the mistake was in the initial calculation of the number of blocks for the tens digit 4. I thought it was 4 blocks, but actually, it's 5 blocks because 440-449 is within 488, making it the fifth block.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, the fifth block is only 9 numbers because 480-488 is less than 480-489.\n\nSo, to correct:\n\nUnits place:\n\n4's:49\n\n8's:49\n\nTens place:\n\n4's:50\n\n8's:49\n\nTotal 4's:99\n\nTotal 8's:98\n\nDifference:1.\n\nTherefore, there is one more 4 than 8.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 99, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there is one more 4 than 8.\n\n$\\boxed{1}$"

    "text": " Each page is printed once, starting from page 1 up to page 488. I need to find how many more 4's there are than 8's.\n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to get the difference.\n\nLet me start by understanding how digits are counted in numbers. For example, each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number, depending on how large the page number is. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488, so the highest is a three-digit number.\n\nI think it would help to break this down by the number of digits in the page numbers. So, I can separate the problem into one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit page numbers.\n\n1. **One-digit page numbers:** These are pages 1 to 9. In this range, each digit from 1 to 9 appears exactly once. So, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 appears once. So, for one-digit numbers, the count for 4's is 1 and for 8's is 1.\n\n2. **Two-digit page numbers:** These are pages 10 to 99. Here, each page number has two digits: tens place and units place. I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in the tens and units places separately.\n\n   - **Tens place:** For two-digit numbers, the tens place ranges from 1 to 9. Each digit from 1 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 10-19 for tens digit 1, 20-29 for tens digit 2, etc.). So, for the tens place:\n     - The digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49).\n     - The digit 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n   \n   - **Units place:** For the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 9 times in each position across the two-digit numbers (since there are 90 two-digit numbers, 10-99, and 10 digits, so 9 times each). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. For each tens digit, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9, so for each tens digit (1-9), the units digit 4 appears once. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 9 (since there are 9 tens digits, each contributing one 4 in the units place). Similarly, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the units place.\n\n   So, combining both tens and units places for two-digit numbers:\n   - Digit 4: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times.\n   - Digit 8: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times.\n\n3. **Three-digit page numbers:** These are pages 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because there are three places to consider: hundreds, tens, and units.\n\n   Let me break it down:\n\n   - **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, let's consider each hundreds digit separately.\n\n     - For hundreds digit 1 (pages 100-199):\n       - The hundreds place is 1, so 4 and 8 don't appear here.\n       - Now, we need to count the number of times 4 and 8 appear in the tens and units places for pages 100-199.\n       - Tens place: Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for the tens place:\n         - 4 appears 10 times (140-149).\n         - 8 appears 10 times (180-189).\n       - Units place: Similarly, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the units place for each hundred. So:\n         - 4 appears 10 times (104, 114, ..., 194).\n         - 8 appears 10 times (108, 118, ..., 198).\n       - So, total for 100-199:\n         - 4's: 10 (tens) + 10 (units) = 20.\n         - 8's: 10 (tens) + 10 (units) = 20.\n\n     - For hundreds digit 2 (pages 200-299):\n       - Similar to above, 4 and 8 don't appear in the hundreds place.\n       - Tens place:\n         - 4 appears 10 times (240-249).\n         - 8 appears 10 times (280-289).\n       - Units place:\n         - 4 appears 10 times (204, 214, ..., 294).\n         - 8 appears 10 times (208, 218, ..., 298).\n       - Total for 200-299:\n         - 4's: 20.\n         - 8's: 20.\n\n     - For hundreds digit 3 (pages 300-399):\n       - Again, 4's and 8's don't appear in the hundreds place.\n       - Tens place:\n         - 4 appears 10 times (340-349).\n         - 8 appears 10 times (380-389).\n       - Units place:\n         - 4 appears 10 times (304, 314, ..., 394).\n         - 8 appears 10 times (308, 318, ..., 398).\n       - Total for 300-399:\n         - 4's: 20.\n         - 8's: 20.\n\n     - For hundreds digit 4 (pages 400-488):\n       - Now, the hundreds digit is 4, so every page from 400 to 488 will have a 4 in the hundreds place. Let's count how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place here: from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n       - Now, let's count the 4's and 8's in the tens and units places for 400-488.\n       \n       - **Tens place:**\n         - Pages 400-488: The tens digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, let's see:\n           - For 400-409: tens digit is 0.\n           - 410-419: tens digit is 1.\n           - ...\n           - 480-488: tens digit is 8.\n         - We need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n         - 4 appears in the tens place for pages 440-449, which is 10 times.\n         - 8 appears in the tens place for pages 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488), so the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages. But wait, 480-488 is actually 9 pages because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n       \n       - **Units place:**\n         - For the units place, each digit from 0-9 appears a certain number of times. Let's consider each hundred block:\n           - From 400-488, we can think of it as 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each tens digit.\n           - The number of times each digit appears in the units place can be calculated by how many complete tens blocks there are and any partial blocks.\n           - Since 89 divided by 10 is 8 with a remainder of 9, each digit from 0-9 appears 8 times, and then the digits 0-8 appear once more in the last partial block (480-488).\n           - So, for the units place:\n             - Digit 4 appears 8 times in each complete block, and then once more in the last partial block (484), so total 8 + 1 = 9 times.\n             - Digit 8 appears 8 times in each complete block, and then once more in the last partial block (488), so total 8 + 1 = 9 times.\n       \n       - Now, let's sum up the 4's and 8's in the tens and units places for 400-488:\n         - 4's:\n           - Tens place: 10 (from 440-449).\n           - Units place: 9 (as calculated).\n           - Plus the 89 times in the hundreds place.\n           - So total 4's: 89 + 10 + 9 = 108.\n         - 8's:\n           - Tens place: 9 (from 480-488).\n           - Units place: 9 (as calculated).\n           - So total 8's: 9 + 9 = 18.\n       \n       Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\n       Actually, for the hundreds digit 4, the hundreds place contributes 89 4's. Then, for the tens and units places within 400-488, I need to count how many 4's and 8's appear in those positions.\n\n       Let me correct the approach:\n\n       - **Tens place in 400-488:**\n         - The tens digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, there are 10 pages (except for the last one, which is 480-488, which is 9 pages).\n         - So, for each tens digit, the number of pages is:\n           - Tens digits 0-7: each has 10 pages.\n           - Tens digit 8: has 9 pages (480-488).\n         - Now, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n           - Only when the tens digit is 4, which is from 440-449. That's 10 pages, so 10 times.\n         - How many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n           - When the tens digit is 8, which is 9 pages (480-488), so 9 times.\n\n       - **Units place in 400-488:**\n         - For each tens group (e.g., 400-409, 410-419, etc.), the units digit cycles 0-9.\n         - Since there are 8 full tens groups (400-409 up to 470-479) and then the last partial group 480-488.\n         - For each full tens group, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place, so for 8 full groups, each digit appears 8 times.\n         - In the last partial group (480-488), the units digits are 0-8, so each digit 0-8 appears once, and 9 doesn't appear.\n         - So, for the units place:\n           - Digit 4 appears 8 times (once in each of the 8 full groups) plus once in the partial group (484), so total 9 times.\n           - Digit 8 appears 8 times in the full groups plus once in the partial group (488), so total 9 times.\n\n       So, combining tens and units places in 400-488:\n       - 4's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n       - 8's: 9 (tens) + 9 (units) = 18.\n\n       Plus the hundreds place:\n       - 4's: 89 (from hundreds place).\n       - 8's: 0 (since hundreds digit is 4, not 8).\n\n       So, total for 400-488:\n       - 4's: 89 + 19 = 108.\n       - 8's: 0 + 18 = 18.\n\n   Now, let's sum up all the three-digit page numbers (100-488):\n   - 100-199: 4's = 20, 8's = 20.\n   - 200-299: 4's = 20, 8's = 20.\n   - 300-399: 4's = 20, 8's = 20.\n   - 400-488: 4's = 108, 8's = 18.\n   - So, total for three-digit numbers:\n     - 4's: 20 + 20 + 20 + 108 = 168.\n     - 8's: 20 + 20 + 20 + 18 = 78.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the page numbers:\n\n- One-digit: 4's = 1, 8's = 1.\n- Two-digit: 4's = 19, 8's = 19.\n- Three-digit: 4's = 168, 8's = 78.\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, let me recheck the three-digit numbers, especially the 400-488 part.\n\nIn 400-488:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages).\n- Tens place:\n  - 4 appears 10 times (440-449).\n  - 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n- Units place:\n  - 4 appears 9 times (as calculated).\n  - 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, 4's in 400-488: 89 (hundreds) + 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 108.\n8's in 400-488: 9 (tens) + 9 (units) = 18.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNow, for the three-digit numbers:\n\n100-199: 20 4's and 20 8's.\n\nSame for 200-299 and 300-399. So, 20 each for 4's and 8's.\n\nSo, 3 sets of 20 each: 60 4's and 60 8's.\n\nPlus 400-488: 108 4's and 18 8's.\n\nTotal three-digit 4's: 60 + 108 = 168.\nTotal three-digit 8's: 60 + 18 = 78.\n\nAdding one-digit and two-digit:\n\nOne-digit: 1 each.\n\nTwo-digit: 19 each.\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot, but considering the higher numbers, maybe it's right.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of another way to calculate the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nAnother approach is to consider each digit position separately across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nLet's consider units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - For each digit position, the number of times a digit appears can be calculated based on cycles.\n   - From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers.\n   - Number of complete cycles: 488 // 10 = 48 cycles, with 8 remaining numbers (481-488).\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place.\n   - Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so digits 1-8 appear once each, and 9 and 0 don't appear.\n   - So, total for units place:\n     - Digit 4: 48 + 1 (from 484) = 49.\n     - Digit 8: 48 + 1 (from 488) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers, with each digit 0-9 appearing 10 times in each hundred.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488.\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 times each digit in the tens place.\n   - So, for the first 400 pages:\n     - Each digit 0-9 appears 4 * 10 = 40 times in the tens place.\n   - Now, for 401-488:\n     - The tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488).\n     - For each tens digit from 0 to 8:\n       - Tens digit 0: 10 pages (401-410), but since we're starting at 401, it's 10 pages.\n       - Similarly, tens digits 1-7: each has 10 pages.\n       - Tens digit 8: has 9 pages (480-488).\n     - So, for the tens place in 401-488:\n       - Each digit 0-7 appears 10 times.\n       - Digit 8 appears 9 times.\n     - Therefore, in 401-488, the tens digits contribute:\n       - Digit 4: 10 times (tens digit 4, pages 440-449).\n       - Digit 8: 9 times (tens digit 8, pages 480-488).\n   - So, total for tens place:\n     - Digit 4: 40 (from first 400) + 10 = 50.\n     - Digit 8: 40 (from first 400) + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit changes every 100 pages.\n   - From 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (not printed, as page numbers start at 1, so no hundreds digit here).\n   - From 100-199: hundreds digit is 1.\n   - From 200-299: hundreds digit is 2.\n   - From 300-399: hundreds digit is 3.\n   - From 400-488: hundreds digit is 4.\n   - So, the hundreds digit 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n   - The hundreds digit 8 doesn't appear because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8.\n\n   So, total for hundreds place:\n   - Digit 4: 89.\n   - Digit 8: 0.\n\nNow, summing up all digit places:\n\n- Units place:\n  - 4: 49\n  - 8: 49\n- Tens place:\n  - 4: 50\n  - 8: 49\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 4: 89\n  - 8: 0\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nThis matches the previous calculation, so I think 90 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and subtract the number of times 8 appears. The difference will be the answer.\n\nFirst, I should understand how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, three-digit, or four-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers can be 1-digit (1-9), two-digit (10-99), three-digit (100-488). Wait, 488 is a three-digit number, so no four-digit numbers here.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to break down the problem by each digit place: units, tens, hundreds, and maybe thousands, but since we don't have any thousands here, I can ignore that.\n\nI'll start by considering each digit place separately for both 4 and 8. Let's first count the number of 4's.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. So, how many such sets are there up to 488?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10 and a partial set of 8 numbers (481-488). In each full set, there's one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times 1 is 48. In the partial set (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so there's one more 4 (484). So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: For every 100 numbers, the digit in the tens place cycles from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many full hundreds are there in 488?\n\n488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nThen, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens place cycles from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? From 401-410, the tens digit is 0, 410-419 is 1, 420-429 is 2, 430-439 is 3, 440-449 is 4, 450-459 is 5, 460-469 is 6, 470-479 is 7, 480-488 is 8. So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 more 4's. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: For every 1000 numbers, each digit from 0-9 appears 100 times in the hundreds place. But since we're only going up to 488, let's see. The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place?\n\nFrom 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these 89 numbers. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me check that. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles 0-9, so there's one 8 in each set of 10. So, up to 488, how many full sets of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets and a partial set of 8 numbers (481-488). Each full set contributes one 8, so 48 * 1 = 48. In the partial set (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once (488). So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: For every 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers. There are 4 full hundreds in 488 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 8's, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nIn the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? From 401-410, tens digit is 0; 410-419 is 1; ... 480-488 is 8. So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, right? Because 480 has 8 in the tens place, 481 too, up to 488. So, that's 9 times. So, 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait, in the full hundreds, each contributes 10, so 4*10=40. Then in the remaining 88 numbers, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 8's. So, yes, 40 + 9 = 49 in the tens place. Units place was 49, so total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check: for the tens place, in 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 8's in the tens place beyond the full hundreds.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but wait, in the units place, from 1-488, how many 8's are there? Let me think again. For each 10 numbers, there's one 8 in the units place. So, 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus the partial set from 481-488, which is 8 numbers, and in those, the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once at 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49, which is correct.\n\nIn the tens place, each full hundred contributes 10 8's, so 4 full hundreds give 40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, 40 + 9 = 49 in the tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the 8's in the hundreds place are zero, which is correct because 488 is less than 800.\n\nSo, total 8's: 98.\n\nNow, total 4's: 188.\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, let's recount the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for 4's would be higher, but let me check again.\n\nIn the hundreds place, the 4's are from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4's, we have 40 in the full hundreds and 10 in the last partial hundred (440-449), so 50 total.\n\nIn the units place, 49 4's.\n\nSo, 89 + 50 + 49 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nIn the units place, 49.\n\nIn the tens place, 40 in full hundreds and 9 in the last partial hundred, so 49.\n\nSo, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nThus, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's another way to approach this, maybe using a formula.\n\nAlternatively, for each digit place, the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to N can be calculated using a formula, but I think the approach I took is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the 4's in the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 4's. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4's: in each hundred, 10 times, so 4 hundreds give 40, and in the last partial hundred, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 more, totaling 50.\n\nIn the units place, 49 4's.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nIn the units place, 49.\n\nIn the tens place, 40 from full hundreds and 9 from the last partial hundred, totaling 49.\n\nSo, 98 8's.\n\nThus, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because I feel like maybe I'm missing something, but I can't see where. Let me try a smaller example to see if my method works.\n\nSuppose we have a book with page numbers up to 20. Let's count the 4's and 8's.\n\nPages: 1-20.\n\nNumber of 4's: 4,14 \u2192 2 times.\n\nNumber of 8's: 8,18 \u2192 2 times.\n\nDifference: 0.\n\nUsing my method:\n\nUnits place:\n\nFor 4's: 4,14 \u2192 2.\n\nFor 8's: 8,18 \u2192 2.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4's: 40-49, but since we only go up to 20, no 4's in the tens place.\n\nFor 8's: 80-89, which is beyond 20, so none.\n\nHundreds place: none.\n\nSo, total 4's: 2, 8's: 2, difference 0. Correct.\n\nAnother example: up to 30.\n\n4's: 4,14,24 \u2192 3.\n\n8's: 8,18,28 \u2192 3.\n\nDifference: 0.\n\nUsing my method:\n\nUnits place: 3 4's and 3 8's.\n\nTens place: none, since 40-49 and 80-89 are beyond 30.\n\nHundreds place: none.\n\nSo, correct.\n\nAnother example: up to 50.\n\n4's: 4,14,24,34,44 \u2192 5.\n\n8's: 8,18,28,38,48 \u2192 5.\n\nDifference: 0.\n\nWait, but according to my method, units place: 5 4's, 5 8's.\n\nTens place: 40-49: 10 4's, but since we're only up to 50, 40-49 is 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place. So total 4's: 5 (units) +10 (tens) =15.\n\nSimilarly, 8's: units place: 5, tens place: 40-49 doesn't contribute to 8's, but 80-89 is beyond 50, so 0. So total 8's: 5.\n\nWait, that's a problem because in reality, up to 50, 4's are 5 in units and 10 in tens (40-49), total 15, while 8's are 5 in units and 0 in tens, total 5. So difference is 10.\n\nBut in reality, up to 50, 4's are 15, 8's are 5, so difference is 10.\n\nWait, so my method works here. So, in the earlier problem, perhaps the difference is indeed 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 4's. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4's, each hundred contributes 10, so 4*10=40, plus in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more, total 50.\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nSo, 89 + 50 + 49 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nTens place: 40 +9=49.\n\nSo, 98.\n\n188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - For every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - Total sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full sets (480 numbers) + 8 remaining numbers (481-488).\n   - 48 * 1 = 48.\n   - In 481-488, 484 contributes one more 4.\n   - Total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - For every 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n   - 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400): 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - In 401-488, 440-449 contributes 10 more 4's.\n   - Total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers.\n   - Total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - For every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - 48 full sets (480 numbers) + 8 remaining numbers (481-488).\n   - 48 * 1 = 48.\n   - In 481-488, 488 contributes one more 8.\n   - Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - For every 100 numbers, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n   - 4 full hundreds: 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - In 401-488, 480-488 contributes 9 more 8's.\n   - Total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since 488 < 800).\n   - Total 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " I'm going to try to solve this step by step, even though I'm not too confident about it yet.\n\nFirst, I think I need to figure out how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488. Then, I'll do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by understanding how digits are counted in numbers. Each page number can be considered as a three-digit number, right? So, for example, page 1 is 001, page 10 is 010, and page 100 is 100. This way, every page number can be broken down into hundreds, tens, and units digits. Maybe this approach will help me count the 4's and 8's systematically.\n\nSo, I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place and then sum them up.\n\nLet's start with the digit 4.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - To find the total number of 4's in the units place, I can divide the total number of pages by 10. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8. Since we can't have a fraction of a count, I should take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 488 include an extra 4 in the units place beyond the 48th block? Let me check: 484 is the last page where the units digit is 4 before 488. So, yes, that's 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, which is 488, so the units digit is 8, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is page 484. So, from 1 to 488, how many 4's are in the units place? It's 48 times because 488/10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 4. So, 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 4's in the tens place.\n   - How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages in the 400-488 range.\n   - In each full hundred, we have 10 4's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Now, in the partial block from 401 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in the range 440-449. That's another 10 pages where the tens digit is 4. So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, total 50 4's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these pages has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me check. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the pages from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. So, that's 89.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 is correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for each hundred, we have 10 4's, so 4 hundreds \u00d710=40, plus the 10 in 440-449, which is 50. Correct.\n\nIn the units place, 488 /10=48.8, so 48 times. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, in each block of 10, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many 8's in units place?\n   - 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8. So, 48 times.\n   - But wait, does the last block end at 488, which is an 8 in the units place. So, 488 is included, so that's correct. So, 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit is 8 in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488.\n   - How many such blocks are there? Let's see, from 1-488, the hundreds go up to 4, so we have:\n     - 80-89: 10 numbers\n     - 180-189: 10 numbers\n     - 280-289: 10 numbers\n     - 380-389: 10 numbers\n     - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 pages: 480,481,...,488)\n   - So, total in tens place: 4 blocks \u00d710 + 9 = 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 1 to 488, the tens digit is 8 in:\n- 80-89: 10\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nSo, that's 4\u00d710 +9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n- Units place:48\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's=48+49+0=97.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier I had 48 in units, 49 in tens, so 97 total 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. Each hundred block has 10 8's in the tens place, except the last one, which is only 9 because we stop at 488.\n\nSo, 4 full hundreds (1-400) each contribute 10 8's in the tens place, and the 400-488 block contributes 9. So, 4\u00d710 +9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 8's:48+49=97.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's.\n\nNumber of 4's:187\nNumber of 8's:97\nDifference:187 -97=90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nCounting 4's:\n- Units:48\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:48+50=98, 98+89=187. Correct.\n\nCounting 8's:\n- Units:48\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:48+49=97. Correct.\n\nDifference:187-97=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's there. That seems correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place in 4's, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so that's 10 4's in the tens place. Plus the 40 from the other hundreds, so 50 total. That's correct.\n\nFor the units place, 488/10=48.8, so 48 4's. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, units place:48, tens place:49, so 97 total. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 187-97=90.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (488 / 10 = 48.8, taking the integer part).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (4 full hundreds \u00d7 10 + 10 in 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (pages 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (488 / 10 = 48.8, taking the integer part).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (4 full hundreds \u00d7 10 + 9 in 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences (no pages 800-899).\n\nTotal 8's = 48 + 49 + 0 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears and how many times 8 appears, then find the difference between those two counts.\n\nLet me start by understanding the problem. Each page is numbered from 1 to 488, and I need to count the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in each of these page numbers. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to get the answer.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to break down the problem by the number of digits in the page numbers. So, I'll consider 1-digit, 2-digit, and 3-digit page numbers separately.\n\nFirst, let's handle the 1-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digit 4 appears once (page 4), and the digit 8 appears once (page 8). So, for 1-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear once each.\n\nNext, I'll move on to 2-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each digit can be considered separately: the tens place and the units place.\n\nStarting with the tens place for 2-digit numbers: the tens digit can be any number from 1 to 9. For the digit 4, it appears in the tens place for pages 40 to 49. That's 10 occurrences (40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49). Similarly, for the digit 8, it appears in the tens place for pages 80 to 89, which is also 10 occurrences (80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89).\n\nNow, looking at the units place for 2-digit numbers: for each ten, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, for each ten (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place (e.g., 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for 8 (e.g., 18, 28, etc.). There are 9 tens in the 2-digit range (10-99), so for the units place, 4 appears 9 times, and 8 also appears 9 times.\n\nSo, for 2-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19. Similarly, the total number of 8's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check again. For the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times. For the units place, in each ten, 4 appears once, so 9 tens would give 9 times. Same for 8. So, yes, 10 + 9 = 19 for both 4 and 8 in 2-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to 3-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because there are three places to consider: hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nLet me break it down by each digit place.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book has 488 pages. So, the hundreds digit ranges from 1 to 4.\n\nFor the digit 4 in the hundreds place: It appears from page 400 to 488. That's 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nFor the digit 8 in the hundreds place: Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 does not appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nNext, the tens place in 3-digit numbers. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each hundred. So, for each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit can be 0-9.\n\nFor the digit 4 in the tens place: In each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.). However, for the last hundred (400-488), the tens digit can only go up to 8 because 488 is the last page. So, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 pages. But wait, 400-488 includes 400-488, so the tens digit can go up to 8, but 4 is still present as a tens digit. So, in each hundred, 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Since there are four hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), but wait, 400-488 is not a complete hundred. So, actually, the hundreds are 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nSo, for the first three hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. That's 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30.\n\nFor the last hundred, 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, that's another 10. So, total for the tens place: 30 + 10 = 40 occurrences of 4.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place: Let's see. In each hundred, the tens digit 8 occurs for 10 pages (e.g., 180-189, 280-289, etc.). For the first three hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each has 10 occurrences, so 3 \u00d7 10 = 30.\n\nIn the last hundred, 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is 9 pages, right? Because 480 is page 480, 481, ..., up to 488, which is 9 pages. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 pages because from 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers (480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488). So, in the tens place, 8 occurs 9 times in the last hundred.\n\nSo, total for 8 in the tens place: 30 (from first three hundreds) + 9 (from last hundred) = 39.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. In 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 times. So, 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in 3-digit numbers. The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each combination of hundreds and tens digits.\n\nFor the digit 4 in the units place: In each hundred, for each tens digit, the units digit 4 occurs once. So, for each hundred, there are 10 tens digits (0-9), each contributing one occurrence of 4 in the units place. So, 10 occurrences per hundred.\n\nBut again, we have to check if the last hundred (400-488) is complete or not. Since 400-488 is 89 pages, the units digit goes up to 8 in the last set (480-488). Wait, no, the units digit cycles every 10 pages, regardless of the tens digit. So, in each hundred, the units digit 4 occurs 10 times. So, for the first three hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each has 10 occurrences of 4 in the units place, so 3 \u00d7 10 = 30.\n\nIn the last hundred, 400-488, how many times does the units digit 4 occur? Well, from 400 to 488, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each tens digit. But since 488 is the last page, the units digit goes up to 8 in the last set (480-488). So, in 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nWell, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, the units digit 4 occurs once. So, that's 9 occurrences (for tens digits 0-8). Wait, but 488 is included, so the last tens digit is 8, and units digits go up to 8. So, for tens digits 0-8, units digit 4 occurs once each, so 9 times.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is 89 pages, which is 8 full tens (0-9) for 80 pages, and then 8 more pages (480-488). Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think differently.\n\nIn 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. So, that's 9 times because the last page is 488, so 484 is included, but 494 would be beyond 488, so we stop at 484. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, in the units place, for the last hundred, 4 appears 9 times.\n\nTherefore, total for units place: 30 (from first three hundreds) + 9 (from last hundred) = 39.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place: Let's do the same analysis.\n\nIn each hundred, the units digit 8 occurs once per ten. So, for each hundred, 10 occurrences. So, for the first three hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each has 10 occurrences of 8 in the units place, so 3 \u00d7 10 = 30.\n\nIn the last hundred, 400-488, the units digit 8 occurs in 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 occurrences because 488 is included, but 498 would be beyond 488, so we stop at 488. So, 9 times.\n\nTherefore, total for units place: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but let me check if 488 is included. Yes, 488 is the last page, so 488 is counted. So, units digit 8 occurs 9 times in the last hundred.\n\nSo, summarizing for 3-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 occurs 89 times, 8 occurs 0 times.\n- Tens place: 4 occurs 40 times, 8 occurs 39 times.\n- Units place: 4 occurs 39 times, 8 occurs 39 times.\n\nWait, let me confirm the tens place for 4. Earlier, I thought it was 40 times. Let me recount.\n\nFor the tens place, 4 occurs in each hundred as follows:\n\n- 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 times\n- 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 times\n- 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 times\n- 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 times\n\nSo, that's 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 times. Yes, correct.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place:\n\n- 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 times\n- 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 times\n- 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 times\n- 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 times (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, 3 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 39 times. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for units place, 4 occurs 9 times in the last hundred, as we saw.\n\nSo, now, adding up all the occurrences for 4 and 8.\n\nFirst, let's sum up all the 4's:\n\n- 1-digit: 1\n- 2-digit: 19\n- 3-digit: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\nTotal 4's = 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\n- 1-digit: 1\n- 2-digit: 19\n- 3-digit: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\nTotal 8's = 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's:\n\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, let's verify the counts for each digit place.\n\n1-digit numbers:\n\n- 4: 1\n- 8: 1\n\n2-digit numbers:\n\n- Tens place: 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89)\n- Units place: 4 appears 9 times (14,24,...,94), 8 appears 9 times (18,28,...,98)\nTotal 4's: 10 + 9 = 19\nTotal 8's: 10 + 9 = 19\n\n3-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 4: 89 times (400-488)\n  - 8: 0 times\n- Tens place:\n  - 4: 10 times per hundred \u00d7 4 hundreds = 40 times\n  - 8: 10 times per hundred \u00d7 3 hundreds + 9 times in 400-488 = 39 times\n- Units place:\n  - 4: 10 times per hundred \u00d7 3 hundreds + 9 times in 400-488 = 39 times\n  - 8: 10 times per hundred \u00d7 3 hundreds + 9 times in 400-488 = 39 times\n\nSo, for 3-digit numbers:\n\n- 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n- 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nAdding up all:\n\n- Total 4's: 1 (1-digit) + 19 (2-digit) + 168 (3-digit) = 188\n- Total 8's: 1 (1-digit) + 19 (2-digit) + 78 (3-digit) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the 3-digit numbers, especially the units place for 4. In the last hundred, 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the units place, it's 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 times, correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place for 4, in 400-488, it's 440-449, which is 10 pages, correct.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 pages, so 10 times. So, yes, 40 times for 4 in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place, in 400-488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages, correct.\n\nSo, all counts seem accurate.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the problem is asking. It's about counting the number of times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488 and then comparing that to the number of times the digit 8 appears. The goal is to find how many more 4's there are than 8's.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to break down the problem by looking at each digit position separately: the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place. Since we're dealing with page numbers up to 488, the hundreds digit can go up to 4, the tens digit up to 8, and the units digit up to 8 as well. But I need to be careful because the maximum page number is 488, so some ranges won't go all the way up to 9 in each digit.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position one by one.\n\n**1. Units Place:**\n\nIn the units place, the digits cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, for every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears once. \n\nBut since the book has 488 pages, I need to see how many complete blocks of 10 there are and then check if there's a partial block at the end.\n\n488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then 8 more numbers.\n\nIn each complete block, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 and the number of 8's is also 48. \n\nBut wait, in the last partial block (from 481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So in this partial block, does the digit 4 appear? Yes, at 484. Does the digit 8 appear? Yes, at 488. So in the units place, the 4 appears once more, and the 8 also appears once more. \n\nWait, but actually, the last partial block is from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So the total for the units place would be:\n\nNumber of 4's: 48 (from complete blocks) + 1 (from partial block) = 49\nNumber of 8's: 48 (from complete blocks) + 1 (from partial block) = 49\n\nSo in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So the difference here is zero.\n\n**2. Tens Place:**\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. Here, the digits cycle every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place within each 100-number block. \n\nSo, for example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, the tens digit is 8 for 80-89, which is another 10 numbers.\n\nNow, the book has 488 pages, so we can think of it as 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nLet's calculate the number of 4's and 8's in the tens place.\n\nFirst, in each complete hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 40-49), and the tens digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89). Since there are 4 complete hundreds, that's 4*10=40 for both 4's and 8's.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), we need to check how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nThe tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488).\n\nSo, let's see:\n\n- The tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, right? 440 is greater than 401, so yes. So from 440-449, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers. So that's 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\n- The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So the tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check that again. The tens digit in 480 is 8, right? So from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8.\n\nSo, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the number of 4's in the tens place is 10 (from 440-449) and the number of 8's is 9 (from 480-488).\n\nSo adding that to the 40 from the complete hundreds:\n\nTotal 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49\n\nSo, in the tens place, there are 50 4's and 49 8's. The difference here is 1.\n\n**3. Hundreds Place:**\n\nNow, the hundreds place is a bit different because it only changes every 100 numbers. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and then 4 again for 400-488.\n\nWait, no. Wait, page 1 is page 1, so the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, right? Because pages are like 001, 002, etc., but actually, page numbers don't have leading zeros, so the hundreds digit is only present when the page number is 100 or more.\n\nWait, but in reality, when we talk about page numbers, page 1 is just '1', page 10 is '10', page 100 is '100', etc. So the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. So how many numbers is that?\n\nFrom 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n\nNow, how about the hundreds digit for 8's? The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is in the 800s, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So the number of 8's in the hundreds place is zero.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is indeed 89 pages. Since the hundreds digit can't be 8 in this book, as the maximum page is 488, so 800-899 would be beyond that. So yes, 8's in the hundreds place are zero.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n- Units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49\n- Tens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 49\n- Hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's and 8's across all digit positions.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nWait, that can't be right because 188 - 98 = 90, but I thought the hundreds place alone contributed 89. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in adding up.\n\nWait, let me check again:\n\nUnits place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49\nTens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 49\nHundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0\n\nSo total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the hundreds place contributed 89, which would make the difference at least 89, but the tens place added 1 more, making it 90. So that seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check each part.\n\n**Double-Checking Units Place:**\n\nTotal numbers: 488\nEach 10 numbers contribute one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\nNumber of complete tens: 48 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8)\nSo, 48 * 1 = 48 for both 4 and 8.\n\nIn the last partial ten (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n\nThus, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both.\n\n**Double-Checking Tens Place:**\n\nEach hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n\nNumber of complete hundreds: 4 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400)\nSo, 4 * 10 = 40 for both 4 and 8.\n\nIn the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8.\n\n- For 4's in tens place: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n- For 8's in tens place: 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's.\n\nSo, total in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's.\n\nDifference in tens place: 50 - 49 = 1.\n\n**Double-Checking Hundreds Place:**\n\nHundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nHundreds digit is 8 nowhere because the book ends at 488, so 0 8's.\n\nDifference in hundreds place: 89 - 0 = 89.\n\n**Total Difference:**\n\nSo, adding up the differences:\n\n- Units place: 0\n- Tens place: +1\n- Hundreds place: +89\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the total 4's were 188 and 8's were 98, which gives a difference of 90. So that's consistent.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first thought about it, I thought maybe the hundreds place would contribute 89, which is almost the entire difference. But the tens place adds 1 more, making it 90.\n\nLet me just think if I missed anything.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, which is correct because from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears 10 times in 440-449, which is correct, and 8 appears 9 times in 480-488.\n\nIn the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each.\n\nSo, yes, I think the calculation is correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but wait a moment. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. That's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So yes, 89 4's.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n\nIn the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 89 (hundreds) + 10 (tens) + 49 (units) = 148? Wait, wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, that's not correct because I think I'm adding up the hundreds, tens, and units separately.\n\nWait, no, no, I think I confused myself earlier. Let me clarify:\n\nWait, when I was calculating the total 4's, I added units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 188.\n\nSimilarly, 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but when I was just thinking about the hundreds place, I thought 89 4's, but in reality, the 4's in the hundreds place are 89, but the 4's in the tens and units are 50 and 49 respectively, so total 4's are 89 + 50 + 49 = 188.\n\nSimilarly, 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm now confused because earlier I thought the difference was 90, but I want to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.\n\nLet me try another approach: instead of counting each digit position separately, maybe I can think of it as counting the number of 4's and 8's in each position and then summing them up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write out a small example to test my method.\n\nFor example, let's say we have a book with pages 1 to 20.\n\nHow many 4's and 8's would there be?\n\nUnits place: 4 appears at 4,14; 8 appears at 8,18. So 2 each.\n\nTens place: 4 appears in 40-49, but since we only go to 20, it's 0. 8 appears in 80-89, which is also beyond 20, so 0.\n\nHundreds place: 0 for both.\n\nSo total 4's: 2, 8's: 2, difference 0.\n\nWait, but in reality, pages 1-20: 4's are at 4,14; 8's at 8,18. So yes, 2 each.\n\nAnother example: pages 1-100.\n\nUnits place: 10 4's (4,14,...,94) and 10 8's (8,18,...,98).\n\nTens place: 10 4's (40-49) and 10 8's (80-89).\n\nHundreds place: 0 for both.\n\nTotal 4's: 20, 8's: 20, difference 0.\n\nWait, but according to my earlier method, units place would be 10, tens place 10, so 20 each. Correct.\n\nNow, pages 1-400.\n\nUnits place: 40 4's (each ten contributes one, 40 tens) and 40 8's.\n\nTens place: 40 4's (each hundred contributes ten, 4 hundreds) and 40 8's.\n\nHundreds place: 100 4's (from 400-499, but since we're only going to 400, it's 1 number: 400, so hundreds digit is 4 only once? Wait, no, from 400-400, that's just one page, but wait, 400 is included. Wait, no, 400 is page 400, so the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-400, which is just one page. Wait, but in the case of 400 pages, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-400, which is one page. Wait, but that seems conflicting with my earlier approach.\n\nWait, maybe my method isn't accurate for 400 pages. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should adjust my approach. The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400 to 488, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nBut in the 400-page example, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-400, which is just one page. So in that case, 1 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, for 400 pages, the total 4's would be:\n\nUnits: 40 (from 1-400, 40 times)\nTens: 40 (from 40-49, 140-149, etc., 4 times 10)\nHundreds: 1 (page 400)\nTotal: 81 4's.\n\nSimilarly, 8's:\n\nUnits: 40\nTens: 40\nHundreds: 0\nTotal: 80 8's.\n\nDifference: 1.\n\nWait, but according to my earlier method, the difference would be 1, which is correct because hundreds place contributes 1 more 4 than 8.\n\nSo, in the 400-page example, the difference is 1.\n\nBut in our problem, it's 488 pages, so the hundreds place contributes 89 more 4's than 8's, and the tens place contributes 1 more, so total difference is 90.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully checking each digit position and ensuring that I'm not double-counting or missing any ranges, I can confidently say that the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total complete tens in 488 pages: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8).\n   - Each complete ten contributes 1 '4' and 1 '8' in the units place: 48 each.\n   - Partial ten (481-488): '4' appears once (484), '8' appears once (488).\n   - Total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - Complete hundreds in 488 pages: 4 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400).\n   - Each complete hundred contributes 10 '4's and 10 '8's: 40 each.\n   - Partial hundred (401-488):\n     - '4' in tens place: 440-449 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - '8' in tens place: 480-488 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n   - Total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n   - '4' appears 89 times; '8' never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n   - Total 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - Total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by understanding the problem. Each page is numbered from 1 to 488, and I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and compare it to how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to break down the problem by looking at each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's consider the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digits 0 through 9 each appear once in the units place. So, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. For example, from 0-99, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 40-49, which is 10 times. The same goes for 8.\n\nFor the hundreds place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 100 times in every 1000 numbers. But since our book only has 488 pages, we'll have to adjust for that.\n\nLet me start by calculating the number of 4's and 8's in each place.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor the units digit, each digit from 0-9 appears equally. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488, which is 48 full tens (since 48*10=480) plus the remaining 8 pages. But wait, actually, it's better to think of it as how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate how many times each digit appears in each position up to 488.\n\nSo, let's structure this:\n\n1. Calculate the number of 4's and 8's in the units place.\n2. Calculate the number in the tens place.\n3. Calculate the number in the hundreds place.\n\nLet's start with the units place.\n\nUnits place:\n\nIn every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490), each digit from 0-9 appears exactly once in the units place. But since our book ends at 488, the last block is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, we have 48 complete blocks of 10 (from 1-480) and then an incomplete block of 8 numbers (481-488).\n\nWait, actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete tens and then 8 more pages. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48 times (once per each complete ten) plus the number of times 4 appears in the units place in the last 8 numbers (481-488). Let's see: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once in the units place in this last block.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place: In each complete block of 10, 8 appears once. So, 48 times, plus in the last 8 numbers, 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait, in the last block, 488 is included, so the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once in the units place in the last block. So, yes, 48 +1 =49.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 1-480, each digit 0-9 appears exactly 48 times in the units place. Then from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once. So, 48 +1=49 for both 4 and 8 in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nTens place:\n\nIn the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. So, for example, in 1-100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place from 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears from 80-89, 10 times.\n\nBut since our book goes up to 488, we need to see how many complete hundreds there are and then the partial hundred.\n\n488 is less than 500, so we have 4 complete hundreds (1-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nWait, actually, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, perhaps it's better to break it down into hundreds.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\nIn each hundred (e.g., 1-100, 101-200, ..., 401-500), the digit in the tens place cycles through 0-9 every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSince we have 4 full hundreds (1-400), that's 4 sets where each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4's in the tens place: 4*10=40 times. Similarly, for 8's: 4*10=40 times.\n\nNow, we have the remaining pages from 401-488, which is 88 pages. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (for 401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-490). But since we only go up to 488, the last tens digit is 8, but only up to 488.\n\nWait, 401-488: the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but let's see how many times each digit appears.\n\nFrom 401-410: tens digit is 0 (10 times)\n411-420: tens digit 1 (10 times)\n421-430: tens digit 2 (10 times)\n431-440: tens digit 3 (10 times)\n441-450: tens digit 4 (10 times)\n451-460: tens digit 5 (10 times)\n461-470: tens digit 6 (10 times)\n471-480: tens digit 7 (10 times)\n481-488: tens digit 8 (8 times, since 481-488 is 8 numbers)\n\nWait, but 401-488 is 88 numbers, which is 8 full tens (each 10 numbers) plus 8 more. So, the tens digits from 0 to 8 each appear 10 times except for the last one, which is 8 and appears only 8 times.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.\n\nWait, 401-488 is 88 pages, which is 8 full tens (each 10 pages) plus 8 more. So, the tens digits would be:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 times)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10 times)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10 times)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10 times)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 times)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10 times)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10 times)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10 times)\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 times)\n\nSo, in the tens place from 401-488, the digit 4 appears 10 times (from 441-450), and the digit 8 appears 8 times (from 481-488).\n\nWait, but that's only in the last partial hundred. So, in the tens place, for the entire book, we have:\n\nFor 4's in tens place: 4 (from the first 400 pages) + 10 (from 401-450) = 50 times.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, in the first 400 pages, each hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place, so 4 hundreds would be 4*10=40 times for 4's in the tens place. Then, in the 401-488 range, 441-450 is the only set where the tens digit is 4, which is 10 times. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place: In the first 400 pages, 4*10=40 times. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, total 8's in tens place: 40 +8=48.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. From 1-400, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place per hundred, so 4 hundreds give 40 times for each digit. Then, from 401-488, the tens digits go up to 8, but only up to 488. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 8 times in the last 8 numbers (481-488). So, yes, 40 +8=48 for 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but wait, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 is only in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times.\n\nSo, for the tens place, 4's:50, 8's:48.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nIn the hundreds place, each digit from 1-9 appears for 100 numbers each. For example, 1 appears in 1-100, 2 in 101-200, etc.\n\nSince our book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3, or 4.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (since they are two-digit numbers), so no contribution to the hundreds place count.\n\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1 (100 times)\n\n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2 (100 times)\n\n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3 (100 times)\n\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4 (89 times, since 488-400+1=89)\n\nWait, 400-488 is 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times.\n\n- 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place because 800-899 would be needed for 8 in the hundreds place, but our book stops at 488.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place:89, and 8's:0.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nFrom 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, same.\n\nFrom 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, same.\n\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so 4 appears 89 times (since 488-400+1=89).\n\n8 never appears in the hundreds place because the next would be 800-899, which is beyond 488.\n\nSo, yes, 4's in hundreds place:89, 8's:0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place:49\n\n- Tens place:50\n\n- Hundreds place:89\n\nTotal 4's:49 +50 +89= 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n\n- Tens place:48\n\n- Hundreds place:0\n\nTotal 8's:49 +48 +0=97.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract 8's from 4's:188 -97=91.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n488 pages. Each 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once in units place. Number of complete tens:48 (since 48*10=480), so 48 times each. Then, the last 8 pages:481-488. The units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place:49 each. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nFirst 400 pages:4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times for each digit in tens place, so 4*10=40 for 4's and 40 for 8's.\n\nFrom 401-488: tens digits go from 0 to 8. For 4's in tens place:441-450, which is 10 times. For 8's:481-488, which is 8 times. So, total 4's in tens place:40+10=50, 8's:40+8=48. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n400-488:89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times in hundreds place. 8's:0. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to 8's. \n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears equally in the units place.\n   - Complete groups of 10: 48 groups (480 pages), contributing 48 4's and 48 8's.\n   - Remaining pages (481-488): units digits are 1-8, adding 1 more 4 and 1 more 8.\n   - Total 4's in units place: 49.\n   - Total 8's in units place: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times in every 100 pages.\n   - Complete hundreds (1-400): 4 hundreds, contributing 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - Pages 401-488: tens digits from 0-8.\n     - 4's: 10 times (441-450).\n     - 8's: 8 times (481-488).\n   - Total 4's in tens place: 50.\n   - Total 8's in tens place: 48.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4's: 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8's: 0 times.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{91}."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem clearly. Each page is numbered from 1 to 488, and each page number is printed once. So, I have to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by thinking about how to count the number of times a specific digit appears in a range of numbers. I remember that for such problems, it's useful to break it down by the units place, tens place, hundreds place, etc. So, I'll consider each digit position separately and count how many 4's and 8's appear in each position.\n\nFirst, let's consider the units place. For every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block, the digit 4 appears once (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the digit 8 appears once (like 8, 18, 28, etc.). \n\nNow, the total number of pages is 488, so how many complete blocks of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and an extra 8 pages (since 48*10=480, and 488-480=8). \n\nIn each of these 48 blocks, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 48 times in the units place. \n\nNow, we have an extra 8 pages: 481 to 488. Let's check the units place in these. The numbers are 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. Here, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). \n\nSo, in the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 (from the blocks) + 1 (from the extra pages) = 49. Similarly, the number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, the count of 4's and 8's is the same, 49 each. \n\nNext, let's move to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and the digit 8 appears 10 times (80-89). \n\nNow, the total number of pages is 488, which is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, we can think of it as four complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then the remaining 88 pages (401-488). \n\nFirst, let's calculate for each complete hundred. Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would contribute 4*10 = 40 4's and 40 8's in the tens place. \n\nNow, let's check the incomplete hundred, which is from 401 to 488. The tens digit here cycles from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, let's break it down:\n\n- From 401-410: tens digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's.\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1, no 4's or 8's.\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2, no 4's or 8's.\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3, no 4's or 8's.\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4. So, from 441-450, the tens digit is 4, which means each number contributes a 4 in the tens place. There are 10 numbers here (441-450), so that's 10 4's in the tens place.\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5, no 4's or 8's.\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6, no 4's or 8's.\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7, no 4's or 8's.\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8. So, from 481-488, the tens digit is 8, contributing 8 8's in the tens place (since there are 8 numbers: 481-488).\n\nSo, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit contributes 10 4's and 8 8's.\n\nAdding this to the previous 40 4's and 40 8's from the complete hundreds, the total in the tens place is:\n\n- 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 8's: 40 + 8 = 48\n\nSo, in the tens place, there are 50 4's and 48 8's.\n\nNow, let's move to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 300-399 would have hundreds digit 3, and 400-488 would have hundreds digit 4.\n\nWait, let me correct that. From page 1 to 99, the hundreds digit is 0 (since they are two-digit numbers), but when considering three-digit numbers, page 100 is the first with hundreds digit 1, and so on. Wait, actually, page numbers from 1-99 are two-digit, so the hundreds digit is 0, but in terms of actual digits printed, page 1 is just '1', so the hundreds place doesn't exist. So, perhaps I should consider only page numbers from 100 onwards when considering the hundreds place.\n\nSo, for the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, contributing 89 4's in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only has 488 pages, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4 (400-488). So, the hundreds place contributes 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me double-check. Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (or non-existent), so no 4's or 8's. Pages 100-399: hundreds digits are 1, 2, 3, so no 4's or 8's. Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so each page contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because 800 would be beyond 488, so 0 8's from the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's summarize the counts so far:\n\n- Units place:\n  - 4's: 49\n  - 8's: 49\n\n- Tens place:\n  - 4's: 50\n  - 8's: 48\n\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 4's: 89\n  - 8's: 0\n\nNow, let's add these up for each digit.\n\nTotal 4's = Units + Tens + Hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nTotal 8's = Units + Tens + Hundreds = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 49+48 is 97, and 0, so total 8's are 97. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97.\n\nWait, that seems like a big difference. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the units place: 488 pages.\n\nEach block of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. There are 48 complete blocks (48*10=480), so 48 4's and 48 8's. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) contribute one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So, units place: 48+1=49 4's and 48+1=49 8's. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach block of 100 pages contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so 4*10=40 4's and 40 8's.\n\nNow, the incomplete hundred is 401-488, which is 88 pages. Let's break down the tens digits here:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0\n- 411-420: tens digit 1\n- 421-430: tens digit 2\n- 431-440: tens digit 3\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 numbers: 441-450)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5\n- 461-470: tens digit 6\n- 471-480: tens digit 7\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 numbers: 481-488)\n\nSo, in the tens place for 401-488, we have 10 4's (from 441-450) and 8 8's (from 481-488). So, adding to the previous 40, we get:\n\n4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n\n8's: 40 + 8 = 48\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 100-399: hundreds digits are 1, 2, 3, so no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so each page contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. The number of pages here is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\n8's in the hundreds place: Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: Units (49) + Tens (50) + Hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99 + 89 = 188\n\n8's: Units (49) + Tens (48) + Hundreds (0) = 49 + 48 = 97\n\nSo, total 4's: 188\n\nTotal 8's: 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nWait, that seems like a lot, but let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place. Let me think: from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, from 401-488, we have 10 4's and 8 8's, which added to the 40 each from the first 400 pages, gives 50 4's and 48 8's in the tens place.\n\nUnits place: 49 each.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n\nBut let me think again: is there a way to cross-verify this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the total number of 4's and 8's in a different way.\n\nAnother approach: for each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with units digit:\n\nAs before, each block of 10 contributes one 4 and one 8. 488 pages: 48 full blocks (480 pages) and 8 extra pages.\n\nSo, 48*1=48 4's and 48*1=48 8's in units place from the blocks. Plus, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nTens digit:\n\nEach block of 100 contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so 4*10=40 4's and 40 8's.\n\nNow, the remaining pages are 401-488, which is 88 pages. Let's break down the tens digits:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0\n- 411-420: tens digit 1\n- 421-430: tens digit 2\n- 431-440: tens digit 3\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 numbers)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5\n- 461-470: tens digit 6\n- 471-480: tens digit 7\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 numbers)\n\nSo, in the tens place, we have 10 4's and 8 8's in this partial block. So, total tens place:\n\n4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n\n8's: 40 + 8 = 48\n\nHundreds digit:\n\nFrom 1-99: hundreds digit 0, so no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 100-399: hundreds digits 1,2,3, so no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit 4, so each page contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. Number of pages: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nHmm, seems consistent. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, each of these pages has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 4's. That's correct.\n\nAnd for 8's in the hundreds place, since the book doesn't go beyond 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, yes, the total 4's are 188 and 8's are 97, so the difference is 91.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - 48 complete blocks (480 pages) give 48 4's and 48 8's.\n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) add one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - **Total:** 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 pages contributes 10 4's and 10 8's.\n   - 4 complete hundreds (400 pages) give 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - The remaining 88 pages (401-488) add 10 4's (441-450) and 8 8's (481-488).\n   - **Total:** 50 4's and 48 8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 contribute a 4 in the hundreds place for each of the 89 pages.\n   - **Total:** 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\n**Summing Up:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 97 = 91\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " I need to solve this step by step, so let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I think I should understand what exactly is being asked. The problem is about counting the number of times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488 and then doing the same for the digit 8. After finding both counts, I need to subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find how many more 4's there are.\n\nOkay, so let's start by figuring out how to count the number of times a specific digit appears in all the page numbers up to 488. I remember that when counting digits, it's helpful to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds, etc. Since 488 is a three-digit number, we'll have to look at each place (units, tens, hundreds) for both 4 and 8.\n\nI'll start by counting the number of 4's. Let's tackle each digit place one by one.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, in every block of 10 consecutive pages (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place.\n   - To find out how many times 4 appears in the units place up to page 488, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives me 48 full blocks of 10 pages. Each block contributes one 4, so that's 48 times.\n   - But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks and an extra 8 pages. In those extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digit cycles from 1 to 8. So, does 4 appear in the units place in this extra block? Yes, at page 484. So that's one more 4.\n   - So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 100 pages. Each digit appears 10 times in the tens place within each 100-page block.\n   - For example, from 1-100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place in 40-49, which is 10 times.\n   - Now, let's see how many 100-page blocks we have in 488 pages. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block from 401-488.\n   - In each full block, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 times.\n   - Now, the partial block from 401-488: Let's look at the tens place here. The pages go from 401 to 488. The tens digit here can be 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-490). But since we're only going up to 488, the last set is 481-488, which is 8 pages.\n   - So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear in this partial block? Well, the tens digit is 0 in 401-410, 1 in 411-420, etc. The digit 4 in the tens place would be from 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, right? Let's check: 440 is within 401-488, and 449 is also within. So from 440-449, that's 10 pages where the tens digit is 4. But wait, 440-449 is 10 pages, but our upper limit is 488, which is beyond 449, so all 10 pages are included.\n   - Therefore, in the partial block, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times.\n   - So total 4's in tens place: 40 (from full blocks) + 10 (from partial block) = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit cycles every 1000 pages. In each 1000-page block, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 100 times in the hundreds place. But since we're only going up to 488, let's see.\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 in pages 400-488. Wait, no, the hundreds digit is 4 in pages 400-499, but since we only go up to 488, it's 400-488.\n   - So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From page 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these pages has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times.\n   - Wait, but wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages. So the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. From page 1 to 488, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So the number of times 4 appears in the hundreds place is indeed 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 times.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check each step.\n\nWait, in the units place, I thought 488 /10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus in the last partial block (pages 481-488), units digit is 1-8, so 4 appears once at 484. So 48 +1=49. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place: each 100 pages have 10 4's in the tens place. So 4 full hundreds (1-400) would have 4\u00d710=40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The 4 in the tens place occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So 40 +10=50. That seems correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. So total 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, in every block of 10 pages, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48.\n   - Now, the last partial block is 481-488. The units digits here are 1-8, so 8 appears once at page 488.\n   - So total 8's in units place: 48 +1=49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each 100 pages have 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n   - So, 4 full hundreds (1-400) would have 4\u00d710=40.\n   - Now, the partial block from 401-488: The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The 8 in the tens place occurs in 480-489. But since we're only going up to 488, that's pages 480-488. So how many times does 8 appear in the tens place here? From 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 pages (480,481,...,488). Wait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 pages, right? Because 488 -480 +1=9. So in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in this partial block.\n   - So total 8's in tens place: 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, but wait, in the tens place, each 100 pages contribute 10 8's, so 4\u00d710=40. Then in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 times. So 40+9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only in pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So the hundreds digit 8 never appears. Therefore, 0 times.\n\nSo, total 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\n\nTotal 8's = 49 +49 +0=98.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check the tens place again. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. But 480 is included in 401-488, right? So from 480 to 488, that's 9 pages where the tens digit is 8. So that's correct, 9 times.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, the count is 40 (from 1-400) plus 9 (from 401-488), totaling 49.\n\nNow, let me check if I missed anything in the hundreds place. Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so 0. That's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, total 8's:98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's:\n\nUnits place:49, Tens place:50, Hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct.\n\n8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. 49+49=98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I feel like that might be high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me recount the hundreds place for 4's.\n\nFrom page 400 to 488, inclusive, how many pages is that? 488 -400 +1=89 pages. Each of these pages has a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 times. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place for 4's, from 440-449, which is 10 pages, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. So 10 times. And in the units place, 49 times. So 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's, units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So 98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for 8's. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 pages: 480,481,...,488. So 9 times, correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place for 4's, from 440-449, which is 10 pages, correct.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place for 4's, 400-488 is 89 pages, correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about another approach. Maybe using a formula or a different counting method.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the number of digits in each place up to 488.\n\nFor each digit place, the number of times a digit appears can be calculated by considering higher, current, and lower digits.\n\nBut perhaps it's more complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can write out the counts for each place more carefully.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: For each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: As before, 48 full cycles of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial cycle (481-488), units digit goes from 1-8, so 4 appears once at 484. So total 49.\n\n- Tens place: Each 100 pages have 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So 4 full hundreds (1-400) contribute 4\u00d710=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So 40+10=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 pages, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full cycles of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial cycle (481-488), units digit is 8 at 488. So 48+1=49.\n\n- Tens place: Each 100 pages have 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So 4 full hundreds contribute 4\u00d710=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 pages. So 40+9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, as before.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. So the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because 90 seems like a large number, but given that 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times, which is a significant contribution, it might make sense.\n\nLet me check if there's an alternative way to compute this, perhaps by using a formula or a more systematic approach.\n\nAnother approach is to consider each digit place separately and compute the number of times each digit appears.\n\nFor a number N, the count of digit d in the units place is floor(N/10) + (1 if the units digit of N is >=d else 0).\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. The formula is a bit more involved.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the standard digit counting method.\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N is:\n\nnumber_of_units = (N // 10) + (1 if (N % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place:\n\nnumber_of_tens = (N // 100) * 10 + extra_tens\n\nWhere extra_tens is:\n\nif the tens digit of N is > d, add 10^(digit_position -1)\n\nif it's equal, add (N % 100) +1\n\nWait, perhaps it's getting too complicated, but maybe I can apply it.\n\nLet me try for 4's in the units place:\n\nN=488, d=4.\n\nnumber_of_units = (488 //10) + (1 if (488 %10 >=4) else 0)\n\n488//10=48, 488%10=8 >=4, so +1.\n\nSo 48+1=49. Correct.\n\nFor 4's in the tens place:\n\nWe can use the formula:\n\ncount = (N // 100) * 10 + extra\n\nWhere extra depends on the tens digit.\n\nN=488, so N//100=4.\n\nSo base count=4*10=40.\n\nNow, the tens digit of N is 8.\n\nIf the tens digit >4, then we add 10^(2-1)=10.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the formula is:\n\nIf the current digit (tens place) is greater than d, add 10^(k-1), where k is the position (tens is position 2).\n\nIf the current digit is equal to d, add (units digit +1).\n\nIf it's less, add 0.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think as follows:\n\nFor the tens place, the count is:\n\nhigher = N // 100 =4\n\ncurrent = (N //10) %10=8\n\nlower = N %10=8\n\nIf current >4, then count += (higher +1) *10\n\nIf current ==4, count += higher *10 + (lower +1)\n\nIf current <4, count += higher *10\n\nWait, no, perhaps the formula is:\n\ncount = higher * 10\n\nif current > d: count +=10\n\nelif current ==d: count += lower +1\n\nSo for 4's in the tens place:\n\nhigher=4, current=8, d=4.\n\nSince current >d, count +=10.\n\nSo total count=4*10 +10=50. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place:\n\nhigher=4, current=8, d=8.\n\nSince current ==d, count += lower +1=8+1=9.\n\nSo total count=4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place, the formula is similar.\n\nFor 4's in hundreds place:\n\nhigher = N // 1000=0\n\ncurrent = (N //100) %10=4\n\nlower = N %100=88\n\nIf current >d: count += (higher +1)*100\n\nIf current ==d: count += lower +1\n\nIf current <d: count +=0\n\nWait, but d is 4, and current is 4, so:\n\ncount += lower +1=88+1=89.\n\nSo total count=0*100 +89=89. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in hundreds place:\n\nhigher=0, current=4, d=8.\n\nSince current <d, count +=0. So 0. Correct.\n\nSo using this formula, I get the same counts as before, which confirms that the counts are correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times 8 appears, then find the difference between those two counts.\n\nLet me start by understanding the problem. Each page number is printed once, from page 1 to page 488. So I need to go through each page number and count the occurrences of 4 and 8 in the units place and the tens place.\n\nFirst, I should consider how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. For example, page 1 is just '1', page 10 is '10', and page 100 is '100'. Since the book has 488 pages, the highest page number is 488, which is a three-digit number.\n\nI think the best approach is to break down the counting by the number of digits in the page numbers. That is, handle one-digit page numbers, then two-digit, and then three-digit page numbers separately.\n\nLet me start with one-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digits are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So I can count how many 4's and 8's are there in this range.\n\nFor one-digit numbers:\n- The digit 4 appears once (page 4).\n- The digit 8 appears once (page 8).\n\nSo, in one-digit page numbers, 4 appears once, and 8 appears once. The difference here is zero.\n\nNext, I'll move on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I can count the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nLet's start with the units place. For two-digit numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in the range 10-99, for the units place, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 9 times (since there are 90 two-digit numbers: 90 = 99 - 10 + 1). Wait, no, actually, each digit from 0-9 appears 9 times in the units place because for each ten (10-19, 20-29, etc.), each digit appears once in the units place, and there are 9 tens (10-99). So, for units place, 4 appears 9 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nNow, for the tens place in two-digit numbers. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers, but since we're only going up to 99, each digit from 1-9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. For example, in 10-19, the tens digit is 1, and there are 10 numbers. Similarly, in 20-29, it's 2, and so on up to 90-99. So, for the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49), and the digit 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n\nSo, in two-digit page numbers, the number of 4's is 9 (units) + 10 (tens) = 19. Similarly, the number of 8's is 9 (units) + 10 (tens) = 19. So, again, the difference is zero.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because the range doesn't end at 999 but stops at 488. So I need to be careful not to overcount beyond 488.\n\nLet me break down the three-digit numbers into hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because 488 is the last page. So, the hundreds digit ranges from 1 to 4.\n\nBut since 488 is the last page, the hundreds digit goes from 1 to 4, but for hundreds digit 4, the tens and units digits are limited because 488 is the maximum.\n\nI'll handle each hundreds group separately: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nLet me start with the hundreds place. For each group, the hundreds digit is fixed:\n\n- 100-199: hundreds digit is 1\n- 200-299: hundreds digit is 2\n- 300-399: hundreds digit is 3\n- 400-488: hundreds digit is 4\n\nSo, for the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears only in the 400-488 group, which is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place in any group because the hundreds digits are 1, 2, 3, 4, none of which is 8. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place in three-digit numbers. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place across all three-digit page numbers from 100 to 488.\n\nFor the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears the same number of times in each hundred group, except for the last group if the range is cut short.\n\nLet me break it down by hundreds:\n\n1. 100-199: The tens digit cycles from 0-9 for each ten. There are 10 tens (0-9) and each appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 100-109, 110-119, etc.), so 10 times each digit. So, in 100-199, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\n2. 200-299: Similarly, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\n3. 300-399: Same as above, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place.\n\n4. 400-488: Here, the tens digit can be from 0-8 because the maximum page is 488. So, the tens digits go from 0-8. Let's see how many times each digit appears.\n\nWait, from 400-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8, but for each tens digit, how many numbers are there? For example, 400-409: tens digit 0, 410-419: tens digit 1, and so on up to 480-488: tens digit 8. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, not 10, because 488 is the last page.\n\nSo, for the tens digit in 400-488:\n\n- Tens digits 0-7: each appears 10 times (e.g., 400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479)\n- Tens digit 8: appears 9 times (480-488)\n\nSo, in the tens place for 400-488:\n\n- 4 appears once in the tens place, as part of 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait no, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place for 440-449.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, 8 in the tens place would be in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in 400-488.\n\nWait, but in 400-488, the tens digits go from 0-8, so for each tens digit from 0-8, how many numbers are there?\n\nFrom 400-409: 10 numbers, tens digit 0\n410-419: 10 numbers, tens digit 1\n...\n470-479: 10 numbers, tens digit 7\n480-488: 9 numbers, tens digit 8\n\nSo, for tens digits 0-7, each appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place for 400-488:\n\n- 4 appears 10 times (in 440-449)\n- 8 appears 9 times (in 480-488)\n\nSo, combining all hundreds groups:\n\n- For 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: each has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 3 groups \u00d7 10 = 30 for 4's, 30 for 8's\n- For 400-488: 10 4's and 9 8's\n\nSo total in the tens place across all three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4's: 30 + 10 = 40\n- 8's: 30 + 9 = 39\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, no, for each of the first three hundreds groups (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So that's 3\u00d710=30 for 4's and 3\u00d710=30 for 8's.\n\nThen, in 400-488, the tens place contributes 10 4's (from 440-449) and 9 8's (from 480-488). So total in the tens place:\n\n- 4's: 30 + 10 = 40\n- 8's: 30 + 9 = 39\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but the tens place in the first three groups is 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each of which is 100 numbers, so 300 numbers, each with 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. Then 400-488 adds 10 4's and 9 8's.\n\nSo total in the tens place:\n\n- 4's: 3\u00d710 + 10 = 40\n- 8's: 3\u00d710 + 9 = 39\n\nOkay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, I'll break it down by hundreds groups.\n\nFor the units place, in each hundreds group, each digit from 0-9 appears the same number of times in the units place, except for the last group if the range is cut short.\n\nLet's go through each hundreds group:\n\n1. 100-199: There are 100 numbers. In the units place, each digit 0-9 appears exactly 10 times (since 100/10=10). So, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\n2. 200-299: Same as above, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the units place.\n\n3. 300-399: Same, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times.\n\n4. 400-488: Here, there are 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the units digits cycle from 0-9 for each ten. Let's see how many complete cycles there are and if there's a partial cycle.\n\nEach ten (e.g., 400-409, 410-419, etc.) has 10 numbers, so each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place per ten. How many complete tens are there in 400-488?\n\nFrom 400-488, the tens digits go from 0-8, as before. So, for each tens digit from 0-8, there are 10 numbers, except for the last one (tens digit 8) which only goes up to 488, so units digits from 0-8.\n\nWait, no, actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, the units digits go from 0-8 in this case.\n\nSo, for the units place in 400-488:\n\n- For tens digits 0-7: each has 10 numbers, so each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place, so 10 times each digit for each tens digit, but since there are 8 tens digits (0-7), each digit appears 8 times? Wait, no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, no. For each tens digit, the units digit cycles 0-9, so for each tens digit, each units digit appears once. So, for each of the tens digits 0-7, each units digit 0-9 appears once, so for 8 tens digits, each units digit appears 8 times. Then, for tens digit 8, units digits go from 0-8, so each digit 0-8 appears once, so 9 times each.\n\nWait, no, let me think again. For each tens digit, the units digits go from 0-9, but in 400-488, the tens digits go up to 8, but the units digits in the last tens group (tens digit 8) only go up to 8.\n\nSo, for units digits:\n\n- For tens digits 0-7: each has 10 numbers, so each units digit 0-9 appears once per tens digit, so 8 tens digits \u00d7 1 = 8 times each digit.\n- For tens digit 8: units digits go from 0-8, so each digit 0-8 appears once, so 9 times each.\n\nWait, but that would mean each digit from 0-8 appears 8 + 1 = 9 times, and digit 9 appears 8 times.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me think differently.\n\nThe total number of units digits from 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, each digit from 0-9 appears approximately 8 or 9 times.\n\nWait, let me calculate it properly.\n\nFrom 400-488, there are 89 numbers. The units digits cycle 0-9 for each tens group. There are 9 tens groups (0-8), but the last one (tens digit 8) only has 9 numbers (480-488), so units digits 0-8.\n\nSo, for each digit 0-8, how many times do they appear in the units place?\n\n- For digits 0-8: they appear in all tens groups (0-8), but in the last tens group (8), they only go up to 8. So, for digits 0-8, they appear once in each of the 9 tens groups, but in the last group, only up to 8. Wait, no, actually, for each tens group, the units digits go from 0-9 except the last group, where it's 0-8.\n\nSo, for digits 0-8:\n\n- In tens groups 0-7: each digit appears once per group, so 8 times\n- In tens group 8: each digit appears once\nSo total: 8 + 1 = 9 times each.\n\nFor digit 9:\n\n- Only appears in tens groups 0-7, each contributing once, so 8 times.\n\nSo, in 400-488:\n\n- Units digits 0-8: each appears 9 times\n- Units digit 9: appears 8 times\n\nTherefore, in the units place for 400-488:\n\n- 4 appears 9 times\n- 8 appears 9 times\n\nWait, but 8 is one of the digits 0-8, so yes, it appears 9 times.\n\nSo, now, combining all hundreds groups for the units place:\n\n1. 100-199: 10 4's, 10 8's\n2. 200-299: 10 4's, 10 8's\n3. 300-399: 10 4's, 10 8's\n4. 400-488: 9 4's, 9 8's\n\nSo total in the units place:\n\n- 4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n- 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n\nWait, that can't be right because 400-488 contributes 9 4's and 9 8's in the units place, and the first three groups contribute 10 each, so total 39 for both 4's and 8's.\n\nWait, but let me confirm:\n\nYes, 100-199: 10 each\n200-299: 10 each\n300-399: 10 each\n400-488: 9 each\n\nSo 3\u00d710 + 9 = 39 for both 4's and 8's in the units place.\n\nNow, let me summarize the counts for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 4's: 89 (from 400-488)\n  - 8's: 0\n\n- Tens place:\n  - 4's: 40\n  - 8's: 39\n\n- Units place:\n  - 4's: 39\n  - 8's: 39\n\nSo total for three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\n- 8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place for three-digit numbers, the 4's only appear in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, I had:\n\n- 100-199: 10 4's, 10 8's\n- 200-299: same\n- 300-399: same\n- 400-488: 10 4's, 9 8's\n\nSo, for 4's in tens place: 3\u00d710 +10=40\nFor 8's in tens place: 3\u00d710 +9=39\n\nIn units place:\n\n- 100-199:10 each\n- 200-299:10 each\n- 300-399:10 each\n- 400-488:9 each\n\nSo 3\u00d710 +9=39 for both.\n\nSo total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (units)=168\n8's in three-digit numbers: 0 +39 +39=78\n\nNow, let me add up the counts from one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nOne-digit:\n- 4's:1\n- 8's:1\n\nTwo-digit:\n- 4's:19\n- 8's:19\n\nThree-digit:\n- 4's:168\n- 8's:78\n\nSo total across all page numbers:\n\n- Total 4's:1 +19 +168=188\n- Total 8's:1 +19 +78=98\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me check:\n\nOne-digit:1 each\nTwo-digit:19 each\nThree-digit:168 for 4's, 78 for 8's\n\nSo total 4's:1+19=20; 20+168=188\nTotal 8's:1+19=20; 20+78=98\n\nSo the difference is 188 -98=90\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations, especially for three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4's=89, 8's=0\n- Tens place:4's=40, 8's=39\n- Units place:4's=39, 8's=39\n\nSo total 4's:89+40+39=168\nTotal 8's:0+39+39=78\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen adding one-digit and two-digit:\n\nOne-digit:1 each\nTwo-digit:19 each\nThree-digit:168 and 78\n\nSo total 4's:1+19=20; 20+168=188\nTotal 8's:1+19=20; 20+78=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in the three-digit numbers?\n\nWait, in the units place for three-digit numbers, from 400-488, I had 9 4's and 9 8's. But let me check how many times 4 and 8 appear in the units place across all three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, another approach: for each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), count the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nUnits place:\n\nTotal page numbers:488\n\nIn units place, each digit 0-9 appears approximately the same number of times. Let's calculate how many times each digit appears in the units place.\n\nThe number of complete groups of 10 in 488 is 48 (since 48\u00d710=480), with 8 remaining numbers (481-488).\n\nIn each complete group of 10, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. So, for 48 complete groups, each digit appears 48 times.\n\nThen, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so digits 1-8 each appear once, and 9 and 0 don't appear.\n\nSo total in units place:\n\n- For digits 0-9: each appears 48 times\n- Then, digits 1-8 each get an additional 1, so digits 1-8 appear 48+1=49 times\n- Digits 9 and 0 remain at 48 times\n\nWait, but 481-488 is 8 numbers, so units digits are 1-8, each appearing once.\n\nSo:\n\n- Units place counts:\n  - 0:48\n  - 1:49\n  - 2:49\n  - 3:49\n  - 4:49\n  - 5:49\n  - 6:49\n  - 7:49\n  - 8:49\n  - 9:48\n\nSo, in units place, 4 appears 49 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place:\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears the same number of times in the tens place, except possibly for the last partial group.\n\nThe number of complete groups of 100 in 488 is 4 (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, no, that's not correct because each group of 100 contributes 10 times each digit in the tens place.\n\nWait, actually, each digit in the tens place appears 10 times per hundred group. So, for each hundred group, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nBut since the last hundred group (400-488) is incomplete, we need to check how many times each digit appears in the tens place there.\n\nFrom 400-488, the tens digits go from 0-8, each appearing 10 times except for the last tens group (80-88), which only has 9 numbers (480-488).\n\nWait, no, in 400-488, the tens digits are 0-8, each with 10 numbers except the last one (tens digit 8) which has 9 numbers (480-488).\n\nSo, in the tens place:\n\n- For digits 0-7: each appears 10 times in the tens place in 400-488\n- For digit 8: appears 9 times\n\nSo, total in the tens place across all page numbers:\n\n- For each hundred group 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place, so 3\u00d710=30 for each digit\n- For 400-488: digits 0-7 appear 10 times each, digit 8 appears 9 times\n\nSo, total in tens place:\n\n- For digits 0-7: 30 +10=40\n- For digit 8:30 +9=39\n- For digits 9:30 +0=30 (since 400-488 doesn't have a tens digit 9)\n\nSo, in the tens place:\n\n- 4 appears 40 times\n- 8 appears 39 times\n\nSimilarly, in the hundreds place:\n\nEach hundred group contributes:\n\n- 100-199: hundreds digit 1, so 1 appears 100 times\n- 200-299: hundreds digit 2, appears 100 times\n- 300-399: hundreds digit 3, appears 100 times\n- 400-488: hundreds digit 4, appears 89 times\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times\n- 8 appears 0 times\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for 4 and 8 across all digit places.\n\nFor 4:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:40\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal:49+40+89=178\n\nFor 8:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:39\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal:49+39+0=88\n\nWait, this is different from my previous calculation. Earlier, I had 188 4's and 98 8's, but now using this digit-by-digit approach, I have 178 4's and 88 8's.\n\nWait, I must have made a mistake in my initial approach by breaking it down into one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers. Let me see where I went wrong.\n\nWait, in the first approach, I considered one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit separately, but perhaps I miscounted the three-digit numbers. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the first approach, for three-digit numbers, I had:\n\n- Hundreds place:89 4's\n- Tens place:40 4's and 39 8's\n- Units place:39 4's and 39 8's\n\nBut in the digit-by-digit approach, I have:\n\n- Units place:49 4's and 49 8's\n- Tens place:40 4's and 39 8's\n- Hundreds place:89 4's and 0 8's\n\nSo total 4's:49+40+89=178\nTotal 8's:49+39+0=88\n\nThis seems more accurate because the digit-by-digit approach is a standard method for counting digit occurrences.\n\nSo, the correct counts should be:\n\n- 4's:178\n- 8's:88\n\nDifference:178 -88=90\n\nWait, but in the digit-by-digit approach, units place for 4's is 49, tens place is 40, hundreds is 89, total 178. For 8's, units 49, tens 39, hundreds 0, total 88. So difference is 90.\n\nBut in my initial approach, I had 188 4's and 98 8's, which gave a difference of 90 as well. Wait, but that can't be because 178-88=90, same as 188-98=90. So both approaches give the same difference, but the counts are different.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Let me check where the discrepancy is.\n\nWait, in the first approach, I had:\n\n- One-digit:1 each\n- Two-digit:19 each\n- Three-digit:168 4's and 78 8's\n\nSo total 4's:1+19+168=188\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98\n\nIn the digit-by-digit approach:\n\n- Units place:49 4's, 49 8's\n- Tens place:40 4's, 39 8's\n- Hundreds place:89 4's, 0 8's\n\nTotal 4's:49+40+89=178\nTotal 8's:49+39+0=88\n\nSo, the difference is 90 in both cases, but the counts are different. That suggests that both methods are correct but are counting differently, but the difference remains the same.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach by not considering that two-digit numbers are from 10-99, which is 90 numbers, but in the digit-by-digit approach, I considered all page numbers up to 488, including three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, but in the initial approach, I separated one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit, and added their counts, which should be correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the digit-by-digit approach is more accurate because it's a standard method, so I'll go with that.\n\nSo, in the digit-by-digit approach:\n\n- Units place:4's=49, 8's=49\n- Tens place:4's=40, 8's=39\n- Hundreds place:4's=89, 8's=0\n\nTotal 4's:49+40+89=178\nTotal 8's:49+39+0=88\n\nDifference:178 -88=90\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the units place count in the digit-by-digit approach. Let me re-examine that.\n\nIn the digit-by-digit approach, for units place:\n\nTotal page numbers:488\n\nEach complete group of 10 contributes one of each digit 0-9 in the units place.\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10:48 (since 48\u00d710=480)\n\nRemaining pages:481-488, which is 8 pages, units digits 1-8.\n\nSo, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place.\n\nThen, digits 1-8 each appear once more in the remaining 8 pages, so digits 1-8 appear 48+1=49 times, and 0 and 9 remain at 48 times.\n\nSo, units place:\n\n- 4:49\n- 8:49\n\nThat's correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears 10 times in each hundred group. There are 4 hundred groups:100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488.\n\nIn each of the first three hundred groups, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place, so 3\u00d710=30 for each digit.\n\nIn the last group, 400-488, the tens digits go from 0-8, each appearing 10 times except for 8, which appears 9 times.\n\nSo, for tens place:\n\n- Digits 0-7:30+10=40\n- Digit 8:30+9=39\n- Digit 9:30+0=30\n\nSo, 4's in tens place:40\n8's in tens place:39\n\nHundreds place:\n\nEach hundred group contributes:\n\n- 100-199:1 appears 100 times\n- 200-299:2 appears 100 times\n- 300-399:3 appears 100 times\n- 400-488:4 appears 89 times\n\nSo, 4's in hundreds place:89\n8's in hundreds place:0\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's:49 (units) +40 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=178\n8's:49 (units) +39 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=88\n\nDifference:178-88=90\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. By analyzing each digit place (units, tens, and hundreds) separately, we determine that the digit 4 appears 178 times and the digit 8 appears 88 times. The difference is 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " I'm going to try to work through this step by step, even though I'm not entirely sure how to approach it yet. Let's see.\n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488. Then, I'll do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the structure of the page numbers. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488, which is a three-digit number. So, I'll need to consider units, tens, and hundreds places separately for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nI remember that when counting digits, it's often helpful to break it down by each digit's place. So, I'll handle the units place, then the tens place, and then the hundreds place for both digits.\n\nLet's start with the digit 4.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there?\n   - 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488).\n   - In each group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 * 1 = 48.\n   - Now, check the extra 8 numbers (481-488). The units digits here are 1 to 8, so there's no additional 4 in the units place.\n   - So, total 4's in the units place: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each cycle of 100 has 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n   - How many complete groups of 100 are there in 488? That's 4 (since 4*100=400) with 88 remaining.\n   - Each group contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 groups give 4*10=40.\n   - Now, check the remaining 88 numbers (401-488). The tens digit in this range goes from 0 to 8.\n   - The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers: 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So, that's 10 more.\n   - Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that adds 10 more 4's in the tens place.\n   - So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, but actually, in the hundreds place, each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4. So, that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's in the hundreds place: 89.\n\nNow, adding them all up:\n\nUnits: 48\nTens: 50\nHundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, when I calculated the tens place, I considered that each group of 100 contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, for 400-488, which is 89 numbers, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. The 4 in the tens place occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's correct, 10 more 4's in the tens place beyond the 40 from the first 400 pages.\n\nWait, but actually, the first 400 pages would be 1-400, right? So, from 1-400, the hundreds place contributes 100 4's (from 400-499, but since we're only going up to 400, it's 100 numbers, but wait, 400 is included, so from 400-400, that's 1 number, but wait no, 400 is the first number in the hundreds place 4, so from 400-400, that's 1 number, but actually, 400 is included in the 400-488 range. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. Let me try to recast this.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-399, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, etc., but not 4. So, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, for the tens place:\n\nFrom 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nEach hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4: 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n\nSo, from 1-400, how many such groups are there? There are 4 groups (units, tens, hundreds, thousands). Wait, no, from 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nThen, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in 440-449, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nUnits place:\n\nIn each set of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles 0-9, so 4 appears once per 10 numbers.\n\nFrom 1-488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing 1 4 in the units place. So, 48 * 1 = 48.\n\nThen, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so no additional 4's.\n\nSo, units place 4's: 48.\n\nAdding them up: 89 (hundreds) + 50 (tens) + 48 (units) = 187.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, in each group of 10, the units digit 8 appears once.\n   - From 1-488, there are 48 complete groups of 10, so 48 * 1 = 48.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so the units digit 8 appears once more (488).\n   - So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In each group of 100, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-489.\n   - From 1-488, how many such groups are there?\n   - The first group is 80-89, second 180-189, third 280-289, fourth 380-389, fifth 480-489.\n   - Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but our book only goes up to 488, so in the fifth group, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n   - So, for each group except the last, there are 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - Let's see: from 1-488, how many complete groups of 100 are there? 4 complete groups (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488.\n   - In each of the first four groups, the tens digit 8 occurs in 80-89, etc., so that's 4 groups * 10 = 40.\n   - Now, in the last partial group, 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488).\n   - So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place.\n   - So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n   - So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding them up:\n\nUnits: 49\nTens: 49\nHundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 187\nTotal 8's: 98\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, when I calculated the 4's in the hundreds place, I had 89. But in the 8's, in the tens place, I had 49, and units place 49, totaling 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me check each step again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 40 groups of 100, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place: 4*10=40. Then, in 440-449, another 10, so total 50. Correct.\n\n- Units place: 48 groups of 10, each contributing 1 4, so 48. Then, 481-488 has no 4's in units place. So, 48. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 89 + 50 + 48 = 187. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 groups of 10, each contributing 1 8, so 48. Then, 488 adds another 8, so 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 4 full groups of 100, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more. Total 49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but I'm a bit surprised that the difference is 89. Let me see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write out the counts for each digit place more carefully.\n\nAnother way to calculate the number of times a digit appears in each place is to use the formula:\n\nFor a digit d in the nth position (units=1, tens=2, hundreds=3, etc.):\n\n- Let the divisor be 10^n.\n- The higher part is (number // divisor) * (divisor / 10).\n- The current part is (number % divisor) - (divisor / 10) + 1 if the current digit is >= d, else 0.\n- The lower part is (number % (divisor / 10)) + 1.\n\nBut maybe that's overcomplicating it. Alternatively, maybe I can use a more systematic approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the 8's tens place. Let me check again.\n\nIn the tens place for 8's:\n\nFrom 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nIt's 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n\nEach of the first four ranges (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40.\n\nThe last range, 480-488, is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page), so that's 9.\n\nSo, total 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for units place, 48 groups of 10, each contributing 1 8, so 48, plus 1 more in 488, total 49.\n\nSo, 49 units + 49 tens = 98. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I'm going to try another approach to verify.\n\nLet me consider that in each digit place, the number of times a digit appears can be calculated by:\n\nFor a given digit place (units, tens, hundreds), the count is determined by:\n\n- The number of complete cycles of 10, 100, or 1000, and the remainder.\n\nLet me try this for the digit 4 in each place.\n\n**Digit 4:**\n\n- Units place:\n  - Number of complete cycles of 10: 488 // 10 = 48.\n  - Each cycle contributes 1 occurrence of 4.\n  - Remainder: 488 % 10 = 8.\n  - Since 8 < 4? No, 8 > 4, so add 1 more occurrence? Wait, no. Wait, the formula is:\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nFor a digit d in the units place, the number of times it appears is:\n\ncomplete_cycles = number // 10\nremainder = number % 10\ncount = complete_cycles\nif remainder > d:\n    count += 1\nelif remainder == d:\n    count += 1\n\nWait, but that's for digits less than the current digit. Wait, maybe I'm confusing.\n\nWait, actually, for units digit, the number of 4's is the number of times 4 appears in 1-488 in the units place.\n\nWhich is:\n\nEach 10 numbers contribute 1, so 488 // 10 = 48, and then check if the remainder is >=4. Since 488 % 10 = 8, which is >=4, so add 1 more. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, now I'm confused.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate the units place for 4's.\n\nWait, if I use the formula:\n\nFor units digit, number of 4's is (number // 10) + (1 if (number % 10) >= 4 else 0).\n\nSo, 488 // 10 = 48, and 488 % 10 = 8, which is >=4, so 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nBut earlier I thought it was 48, because from 1-480, there are 48 4's in the units place, and then 481-488 includes 484, which is another 4. So, that's 49.\n\nWait, so that's a discrepancy. Earlier, I thought units place 4's were 48, but according to this formula, it's 49.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nFrom 1-488, the units digit is 4 at 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many times does this happen?\n\nThe first occurrence is at 4, and the last is at 484.\n\nThe number of terms in this sequence is given by:\n\n((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = (480 / 10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSo, that's 49 times. So, earlier, I must have made a mistake by not including the 484.\n\nSo, units place 4's: 49.\n\nSimilarly, let's check the units place for 8's:\n\nUsing the same formula, number of 8's in units place is:\n\n488 // 10 = 48, and 488 % 10 = 8 >=8, so 48 +1=49.\n\nWhich matches my earlier count.\n\nSo, earlier, I had a mistake in the units place for 4's. It's actually 49, not 48.\n\nWait, so that changes the total count for 4's.\n\nLet me redo the count for 4's with this correction.\n\n**Recounting 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n   - Each hundred has 10 occurrences: 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Number of complete hundreds: 4 (1-400), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40.\n   - Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers.\n   - So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributes a 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - So, 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nWait, that's 188 now, up from 187.\n\nWait, but let me check again.\n\nWait, in the units place, it's 49, as per the formula. So, that's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, 40 from the first 400 pages, plus 10 from 440-449, so 50.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 89.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, so earlier, I had 187, but now it's 188. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial count.\n\nSimilarly, let's check the 8's again.\n\n**Recounting 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - As before, 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 8's: 4*10=40.\n   - From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n   - So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 0, as before.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, now, the total 4's are 188, and 8's are 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that's different from before. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial units place count for 4's.\n\nWait, let me confirm the units place for 4's again.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nIt's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484.\n\nThe last occurrence is at 484, which is within 488.\n\nSo, the number of terms is:\n\n(484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49.\n\nSo, 49 times. So, units place 4's:49.\n\nEarlier, I had thought it was 48, which was incorrect.\n\nSo, with that correction, the total 4's are 188, 8's are 98, difference is 90.\n\nWait, but now I'm getting a different answer. I need to make sure.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50=99; 99+89=188.\n\nAnd 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\nTotal:98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but now I'm getting 90. But earlier, I thought it was 89. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial count.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to verify the tens place for 4's.\n\nIn the tens place, from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear?\n\nIt's in 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers.\n\nWait, but from 1-400, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nIt's 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10.\n\nWait, that's 5 sets of 10, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, but 440-449 is within 400-488.\n\nWait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers.\n\nWait, so from 1-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in:\n\n- 40-49:10\n- 140-149:10\n- 240-249:10\n- 340-349:10\n- 440-449:10\n\nThat's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought it was 4*10=40 from 1-400, and then 10 more from 440-449, totaling 50.\n\nWait, but 40-49 is in 1-400, so 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10, so that's 5*10=50.\n\nWait, so that's correct.\n\nSo, tens place 4's:50.\n\nSo, 4's total:49+50+89=188.\n\n8's total:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so the correct answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 89, but that was due to an error in counting the units place for 4's.\n\nWait, but let me check again, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's.\n\nFrom 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nSo, 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\n8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:90.\n\nWait, so the correct answer is 90.\n\nBut now I'm confused because I initially thought 89, but after correcting the units place, it's 90.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use a different method to confirm.\n\nLet me try to calculate the number of 4's and 8's using another approach.\n\nAnother method is to consider each digit place separately and calculate the number of times each digit appears.\n\n**For digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - As established, 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 89 times.\n\nTotal:188.\n\n**For digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 49 times.\n\nTotal:98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check.\n\nFrom 400-488, how many numbers are there?\n\n488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.\n\nEach of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 4's.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought it was 89, but that was because I had incorrectly counted the units place as 48 instead of 49.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check once more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write a small program or use a formula to calculate the number of times each digit appears.\n\nBut since I can't write code here, I'll try to use the formula method.\n\nThe formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the nth digit place (units=1, tens=2, etc.) is:\n\ncount = higher * current_base + extra\n\nWhere:\n\n- higher = number divided by (current_base * 10)\n- current_base = 10^(n-1)\n- If the current digit is greater than d, add current_base\n- If equal, add (number % (current_base * 10)) - d * current_base + 1\n\nWait, perhaps that's too complicated, but let's try.\n\nFor digit 4 in units place (n=1):\n\nhigher = 488 // 10 = 48\ncurrent_base = 1\nIf the current digit (8) > 4, add 1 (since 8 >4, add 1)\nSo, count = 48 * 1 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place (n=2):\n\nhigher = 488 // 100 = 4\ncurrent_base = 10\nIf the current digit (8) >4, add 10\nSo, count = 4 * 10 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but 488 // 100 is 4, and the current digit is 8 in the tens place, which is greater than 4, so add 10.\n\nWait, but 4*10=40, plus 10=50. Correct.\n\nFor hundreds place (n=3):\n\nhigher = 488 // 1000 =0\ncurrent_base=100\nIf the current digit (4) >=4, add (488 % 1000) - 4*100 +1 = 488 -400 +1=89.\n\nSo, count=0*100 +89=89.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8:\n\nUnits place (n=1):\n\nhigher=488//10=48\ncurrent_base=1\nIf current digit (8)>=8, add 1\nSo, count=48*1 +1=49.\n\nTens place (n=2):\n\nhigher=488//100=4\ncurrent_base=10\nIf current digit (8)>=8, add 10\nSo, count=4*10 +10=50.\n\nWait, but 488//100=4, and current digit is 8, so 4*10=40, plus 10=50.\n\nBut wait, in reality, from 1-488, the tens digit 8 appears 49 times, not 50. So, perhaps the formula isn't accurate here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misapplying the formula.\n\nWait, the formula is:\n\nFor digit d in the nth place:\n\ncount = higher * current_base\nif current_digit > d:\n    count += current_base\nelif current_digit == d:\n    count += (number % (current_base * 10)) - d * current_base + 1\n\nSo, for digit 8 in tens place (n=2):\n\nhigher = 488 // (100) =4\ncurrent_base=10\ncurrent_digit = (488 // 10) %10 =8\n\nSince current_digit ==8, which is equal to d=8, so:\n\ncount = higher * current_base + (488 % 100) -8*10 +1\n=4*10 + (88) -80 +1\n=40 +8 +1=49.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, for digit 8 in tens place, count=49.\n\nSimilarly, for units place, digit 8:\n\nhigher=488//10=48\ncurrent_base=1\ncurrent_digit=8\n\nSince current_digit >=8, we add 1.\n\nSo, count=48*1 +1=49.\n\nSo, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nThus, 4's:188, 8's:98, difference=90.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think I've verified it enough times now, so I'm confident the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups of 10, contributing 48 occurrences. The last partial group (481-488) includes 484, adding one more, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges up to 440-449, each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, each page number has a 4 in the hundreds place, totaling 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups, contributing 48 occurrences. The last partial group (481-488) includes 488, adding one more, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full ranges, each contributing 10 occurrences, and the last partial range (480-488) contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8, so 0 occurrences.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " I need to solve this step by step, so let me break it down.\n\nFirst, I think I should figure out how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488. Then, I'll do the same for the digit 8 and subtract the two to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by understanding how digits are counted in numbers. Each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) can be considered separately. So, I'll need to calculate how many 4's and 8's appear in the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:** The 4's in the units place occur every 10 numbers. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such numbers are there? Since the book has 488 pages, the last page with a 4 in the units place is 484. To find the count, I can divide 484 by 10, which gives me 48.4, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence, right? Because 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 48 full tens. Hmm, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is indeed the last 4 in the units place. So, 48 times 4's in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4's in the tens place occur every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see:\n\n   - 40-49: 10 numbers\n   - 140-149: 10 numbers\n   - 240-249: 10 numbers\n   - 340-349: 10 numbers\n   - 440-449: 10 numbers\n\n   Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10 = 50 4's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 4's in the hundreds place occur in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because 400-488 is 89 numbers, but the hundreds digit is 4 only once in each number, so yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nWait, let me check that again. So, units: 48, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 48+50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last page is 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times. Wait, because from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? Let me think. The first 8 is at 8, then every 10 pages. So, the number of 8's in the units place is the number of times 8 appears in the units digit from 1 to 488.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 8's in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10, which is 488 // 10 = 48, but since 488 ends with 8, we add 1 more, so 49.\n\nWait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. Let me confirm: 8*1, 8*2,...,8*49=392, but wait, 8*49 is 392, but 488 is 48*10 +8, so maybe it's 49 times.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to calculate how many times 8 appears in the units place from 1 to 488.\n\nEach 10 numbers contribute one 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and then the last group (481-488) has another 8 at 488. So total 49 8's in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, 8's in the tens place occur in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488.\n\nEach block from 80-89, 180-189, etc., contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are.\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nWait, so the first four blocks each have 10 8's, and the last block (480-488) has 9 numbers because 488 is the end. So total 8's in the tens place: 4*10 +9 = 40 +9 =49.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 80-89, that's 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189, another 10. 280-289, another 10. 380-389, another 10. Then 480-488: 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers because 480 is the first, and 488 is the last, so 488 -480 +1=9.\n\nSo, 4*10=40, plus 9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 8's in the hundreds place would occur in the range 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\n\nTotal 8's = 49 +49 +0=98.\n\nWait, but let me check again. So, units place:49, tens place:49, so 98 8's.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 187 and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 -98=89.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: From 1 to 488, how many 4's in the units place? It's the number of times 4 appears in the units digit. So, every 10 numbers, once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full times, but since 488 is the last page, does 488 have a 4 in the units place? No, it's 488, which ends with 8. So, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is 484. So, from 4,14,...,484: that's 48 numbers, so 48 4's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 48, but let me confirm: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. Wait, that's 49 terms. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. It should be 49 4's in the units place, not 48.\n\nWait, that's a mistake. So, units place for 4's: 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, I had 50, which is correct because each block of 100 contributes 10 4's in the tens place, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49,140-149, etc.), so 5*10=50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nWait, that's different from before. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. The correct count for units place is 49, not 48.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49, as before.\n- Tens place: 49, as before.\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90.\n\nWait, so that's a different answer. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in the initial count for the units place of 4's.\n\nLet me go through it again carefully.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** We need to count how many times 4 appears in the units digit from 1 to 488.\n\nThe numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. The last number is 484 because 488 is the last page, and 484 is the last number with a 4 in the units place before 488.\n\nTo find how many terms there are, we can use the formula: number of terms = ((last term - first term)/common difference) +1.\n\nHere, first term is 4, last term is 484, common difference is 10.\n\nSo, number of terms = ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 4's in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, 4's in the tens place occur in the ranges 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449.\n\nEach of these ranges has 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 4's in the tens place.\n\nNumber of such ranges:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10\n- 240-249:10\n- 340-349:10\n- 440-449:10\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, 5 ranges, each with 10 4's, so 5*10=50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4's in the hundreds place occur from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 -400 +1=89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 4's.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8's in the units place occur at 8,18,28,...,488.\n\nNumber of terms: ((488 -8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 8's.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8's in the tens place occur in 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488.\n\nEach of the first four ranges (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, contributing 10 8's each. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** As before, there are no 8's in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 89. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial count. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the units place for 4's, I now have 49, which was correct. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\n8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. Yes, because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89.\n\nAnd for the 8's in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference was 89, but now it's 90. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial calculation where I thought units place for 4's was 48 instead of 49.\n\nSo, the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let me count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place again.\n\n**4's:**\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50=99; 99+89=188.\n\n**8's:**\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\nTotal:98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count any numbers. For example, in the number 444, does it count three 4's? Yes, because each digit is considered separately. So, 444 would contribute to the hundreds, tens, and units place counts.\n\nSimilarly, 488 would contribute to the hundreds, tens, and units place for 8's.\n\nWait, but in our counts, we considered each digit place separately, so that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the initial count for 4's in the units place. Let me confirm once more.\n\nFrom 4 to 484, stepping by 10, how many numbers?\n\nThe formula is ((last - first)/step) +1.\n\n((484 -4)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the units place. So, 49 4's.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10: ((488 -8)/10)+1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 8's.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but in the initial problem statement, the book has 488 pages, so page 488 is included. So, I think my counts are correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Count the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers (calculated as (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49).\n   - **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 4's, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Count the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers (calculated as (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49).\n   - **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** None, as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - 4's: 188\n   - 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page is printed only once, starting from page 1 up to page 488. I need to find out how many times the digit 4 appears and how many times the digit 8 appears, then subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to get the difference.\n\nFirst, I think I should break this problem down by considering each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Since 488 is a three-digit number, the page numbers can be thought of as three-digit numbers from 001 to 488, but since leading zeros aren't actually printed, I need to adjust my counting accordingly.\n\nStarting with the units place, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in the units place. In any sequence of numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in the units place every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). In each of these 48 groups, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, in each group of 10, 8 appears once, so again 48 times. In the extra 8 numbers, 8 appears once (at 488). So, total 8's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that seems like the same number. Hmm, maybe I need to check this again. Wait, no, actually, when I count 4's in the units place, from 1 to 488, each 10 numbers contribute one 4, and then in the last 8 numbers, 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once. So 48*1 +1=49.\n\nFor 8's in the units place, same logic: 48 groups of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus in the last 8 numbers, 488 is the only one with an 8 in the units place. So 48+1=49. So both 4's and 8's in the units place are 49 each. So the difference so far is 0.\n\nNext, let's move to the tens place. Now, in the tens place, the digit 4 will appear in every block of 100 numbers, specifically from 40-49 in each hundred. So, for example, in 1-100, 40-49 have 10 4's in the tens place. Similarly, in 101-200, 140-149, another 10, and so on.\n\nBut since our book goes up to 488, let's see how many full hundreds we have. 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, we have four full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Wait, actually, 400-488 is part of the fourth hundred. So, in each of these hundreds, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is in the 400s, so that's another 10. So, each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, and there are four hundreds, so 4*10=40. But wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only up to 449, right? Because 450-488 would have tens digits 5-8, so 440-449 is the only block in the 400s where the tens digit is 4. So, that's 10 numbers, so 10 4's. So, total 4's in the tens place would be 4*10=40.\n\nWait, but actually, let me think again. Each hundred from 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each has a block where the tens digit is 4: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349. Each of these contributes 10 4's, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the next block where tens digit is 4 is 440-449, which is another 10, making it 50. Wait, that can't be right because 400-488 is part of the fourth hundred, so maybe I'm double-counting.\n\nWait, no, 400-488 is part of the fourth hundred, but the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in 1-100, 40-49: 10 4's. 101-200: 140-149: 10 4's. 201-300: 240-249: 10 4's. 301-400: 340-349: 10 4's. Then, in 401-488, the next block where the tens digit is 4 is 440-449, which is another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 5*10=50.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is part of the 400s, so maybe the 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's correct. So, total 4's in the tens place are 50.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place. Let's see. In each hundred, the tens digit is 8 in the block 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, in each of the first four hundreds, the 80-89, 180-189, etc., contribute 10 8's each, so 4*10=40. Then, in the 400s, 480-488 contributes 9 8's (since 480, 481,...,488 is 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place). So, total 8's in the tens place are 40 +9=49.\n\nSo, 4's in tens place:50, 8's in tens place:49, so difference so far is 50-49=1.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only when the page number is between 400 and 488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488-400+1=89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nFor the digit 8 in the hundreds place, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can never be 8 because the highest is 4 in 400-488. So, 8's in the hundreds place:0.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place:89, 8's:0, difference is 89-0=89.\n\nNow, adding up the differences from each digit place:\n\nUnits place:0\n\nTens place:+1\n\nHundreds place:+89\n\nTotal difference:0+1+89=90.\n\nWait, but let me check again because I might have made a mistake in counting the hundreds place.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's. For 8's in hundreds place, since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 89-0=89.\n\nIn the tens place, 50-49=1.\n\nUnits place, 49-49=0.\n\nSo total difference is 89+1+0=90.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought about the units place, I got 49 4's and 49 8's, so difference 0.\n\nIn tens place, 50 4's and 49 8's, so difference +1.\n\nIn hundreds place, 89 4's and 0 8's, so difference +89.\n\nTotal difference: 0+1+89=90.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's printed is 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal number of 8's printed is 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98.\n\nWait, 188-98=90, which matches.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the counts again to make sure I didn't overcount.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10)=48 full tens, each contributing 1 4, and in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 484 has a 4 in units place. So, 48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, 8's: floor(488/10)=48, each contributing 1 8, and in the remaining 8 numbers, 488 has an 8, so 48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4's: Each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place. From 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the next block where tens digit is 4 is 440-449, which is another 10, so total 50.\n\nFor 8's: Each hundred contributes 10 8's in the tens place (80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So total 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in hundreds place.\n\n8's: 0, since the book doesn't go beyond 488.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Units Place:**\n   - **4's:** Every 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place. There are 48 full groups of 10 in 488, contributing 48 4's. The last partial group (481-488) has one more 4 (at 484). Total: 49.\n   - **8's:** Similarly, every 10 numbers contribute one 8. The last partial group (481-488) has one 8 (at 488). Total: 49.\n\n2. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Tens Place:**\n   - **4's:** Each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), contributing 40. The 400-488 range adds another 10 from 440-449. Total: 50.\n   - **8's:** Each hundred contributes 10 8's in the tens place (e.g., 80-89). There are 4 full hundreds, contributing 40. The 400-488 range adds 9 from 480-488. Total: 49.\n\n3. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Hundreds Place:**\n   - **4's:** Pages 400-488 have 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Total: 89.\n   - **8's:** No page numbers have an 8 in the hundreds place. Total: 0.\n\n4. **Calculating the Total Counts:**\n   - **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Finding the Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " I need to solve this step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should figure out how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to get the difference.\n\nLet me break it down by the places where the digits can appear: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, I need to consider each digit position separately for all numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every block of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the digit 8 appears once (like 8, 18, 28, etc.).\n\nNow, how many such blocks are there from 1 to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then an extra 8 numbers (481-488). So, in each of the 48 complete blocks, both 4 and 8 appear once each in the units place. That gives 48 times for 4 and 48 times for 8.\n\nBut wait, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial block, the digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). So, adding these, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, both digits appear the same number of times.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. In the tens place, digits cycle every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 in each set of ten numbers. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in the numbers 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in 80-89, which is also 10 times.\n\nNow, how many hundreds do we have? The book goes up to 488, so the hundreds digits go from 1 to 4. Let's break it down:\n\n- For hundreds digit 1: pages 1-100. Here, the tens digit cycles as usual, so 4's and 8's each appear 10 times in the tens place.\n- For hundreds digit 2: pages 101-200. Similarly, the tens digit cycles, so another 10 each for 4's and 8's.\n- For hundreds digit 3: pages 201-300. Again, same thing: 10 each.\n- For hundreds digit 4: pages 301-400. Wait, no, 400 is the next hundred. But the book goes up to 488, so pages 401-488.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me correct that. The hundreds digits go from 1 to 4, but each hundred block is 100 pages. So:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 1-100\n- Hundreds digit 2: 101-200\n- Hundreds digit 3: 201-300\n- Hundreds digit 4: 301-400\n- Then, pages 401-488 are beyond the 400 mark.\n\nWait, but 400 is the end of the 400s, so pages 401-488 are part of the 400s as well, right? So, when considering the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digit in this range goes through 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-488). So, in this range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, that's not correct because 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 times.\n\nWait, no, actually, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book stops at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here. But wait, 480-489 is 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so it's 9 numbers. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place from 480-488.\n\nBut earlier, in each hundred block, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times. So, let's recast this.\n\nFrom 1-400, we have four hundred blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). In each of these, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and the tens digit 8 appears 10 times (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for each hundred, 10 each, so 4 hundreds give 4*10=40 for 4's and 40 for 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, from 401-488, which is 88 pages. The tens digit in this range goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? It's in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. How about 8? It's in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, from 401-488, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nTherefore, total in the tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50 times for 4's, and 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 401-488) = 49 times for 8's.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, and 4 for 300-399, and then 4 again for 400-488.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the hundreds digit is 1 for 1-99, but that's not correct because 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit. Wait, actually, page numbers are from 1 to 488, so pages 1-99 are two-digit numbers, but when considering the hundreds place, it's only from page 100 onwards.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider how many times each hundreds digit appears.\n\n- Pages 1-99: no hundreds digit, so hundreds place is 0, but since we're only considering digits 4 and 8, they don't appear here.\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's in the hundreds place here.\n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, so again, no 4's or 8's.\n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, so no 4's or 8's.\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for each of these pages.\n\nSo, how many pages are there from 400-488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAs for the digit 8, does it ever appear in the hundreds place? Well, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. There's no page 800-899, so the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, total in the hundreds place: 89 times for 4's and 0 times for 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences for each digit in each place.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n- 4's: 49\n- 8's: 49\n\nTens place:\n- 4's: 50\n- 8's: 49\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nSo, total 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 49 + 49 is 98, but I think I made a mistake in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me double-check the tens place. From 1-400, each hundred block contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 each. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449 (10 times) and 8 in 480-488 (9 times). So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50; 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but 49 + 49 is 98, so 98 8's in total.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, 10 and 9, respectively.\n\nIn the units place, both digits appear 49 times each.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I feel like 90 might be too high. Let me see another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position again.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48*1=48, plus in the last partial cycle (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484). So, total 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears 48 times in the units place from 1-480, and once in 488, so 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\nFrom 1-400, there are four hundreds, so 4*10=40 for 4's and 4*10=40 for 8's.\n\nThen, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449 (10 times), and 8 appears in 480-488 (9 times, since 488 is the last page).\n\nSo, total in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-99: no hundreds digit, so no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 100-399: hundreds digits are 1, 2, 3, so no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so 4 appears 89 times (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm getting 90, but I think I might have made a mistake because I feel like the difference shouldn't be that large.\n\nWait, let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these. So, 89 times. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, from 401-488, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 times. 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 10 and 9.\n\nSo, 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nUnits place: 49 each.\n\nSo, 4's total: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's total: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, maybe that's correct. Let me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for 480-488. That's pages 480 to 488, which is 9 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so 9 times. So, 9 8's in the tens place from 480-488.\n\nSimilarly, 440-449 is 10 pages, so 10 4's in the tens place.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each digit from 0 to 9 appears once every 10 pages.\n- Total units place occurrences:\n  - 4's: 48 full cycles (480 pages) + 1 in the last 8 pages (484) = 49\n  - 8's: 48 full cycles + 1 in the last 8 pages (488) = 49\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n- From 1-400: 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 each for 4's and 8's.\n- From 401-488:\n  - 4's: 10 times (440-449)\n  - 8's: 9 times (480-488)\n- Total tens place occurrences:\n  - 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n  - 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- 4's: 89 times (pages 400-488)\n- 8's: 0 times (no page numbers in 800-899)\n\n**Total Occurrences:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " I need to count all the 4's and 8's separately and then find the difference between them. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand that each page number is a number from 1 to 488. So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to get the answer.\n\nI think the best way to do this is to break it down by the different places in the numbers: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Since 488 is a three-digit number, we can consider each digit position separately.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in a sequence of numbers, right? So, from 1 to 488, how many times does each digit appear in the units place?\n\nWell, for every block of 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, the number of times a digit appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete blocks of 10 in 488, plus any extra numbers beyond that.\n\nWait, but actually, page numbers start at 1, so the first block is 1-10, the second is 11-20, and so on. So, the number of complete blocks is 48 (since 48*10=480), and then there are 8 more pages (481-488). So, in the units place, each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times, and then in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so digits 1-8 each appear once more.\n\nTherefore, for the units place:\n- Number of 4's: 48 (from the complete blocks) + 1 (from the extra 8 pages) = 49\n- Number of 8's: 48 (from the complete blocks) + 1 (from the extra 8 pages) = 49\n\nWait, but hold on, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So, yes, both get an extra count of 1 each. So, units place gives 49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. Wait, actually, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for every 100 numbers.\n\nNow, the book has 488 pages, so we can break it down as 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nIn each hundred, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 times each digit appears in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), let's see how the tens digit behaves. The tens digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, it's 1; 421-430, it's 2; 431-440, it's 3; 441-450, it's 4; 451-460, it's 5; 461-470, it's 6; 471-480, it's 7; and then 481-488, the tens digit is 8.\n\nWait, let me check that. 401-410: tens digit is 0 (since 401 is 4 0 1, so tens digit is 0). Similarly, 411-420: tens digit is 1, and so on up to 481-488: tens digit is 8.\n\nSo, from 401-488, the tens digits go through 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Each of these digits appears a certain number of times.\n\nBut how many times does each digit appear in the tens place in the last 88 pages?\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- 401-410: 10 numbers, tens digit 0\n- 411-420: 10 numbers, tens digit 1\n- 421-430: 10 numbers, tens digit 2\n- 431-440: 10 numbers, tens digit 3\n- 441-450: 10 numbers, tens digit 4\n- 451-460: 10 numbers, tens digit 5\n- 461-470: 10 numbers, tens digit 6\n- 471-480: 10 numbers, tens digit 7\n- 481-488: 8 numbers, tens digit 8\n\nWait, that's 9 blocks, but 401-488 is 88 numbers. Let's check: 401-488 is 88 pages, right? 488 - 400 = 88, so yes.\n\nSo, each block from 401-410 to 471-480 is 10 numbers each, and the last block is 481-488, which is 8 numbers.\n\nSo, the tens digits:\n\n- 0: 10 numbers (401-410)\n- 1: 10 (411-420)\n- 2: 10 (421-430)\n- 3: 10 (431-440)\n- 4: 10 (441-450)\n- 5: 10 (451-460)\n- 6: 10 (461-470)\n- 7: 10 (471-480)\n- 8: 8 numbers (481-488)\n\nWait, so in the tens place for 401-488, the digit 8 appears 8 times, and the other digits from 0-7 appear 10 times each. But wait, does that make sense? Because 401-488 is 88 numbers, and 8 blocks of 10 (each contributing 10 counts to the tens digit) would be 80, plus the last 8, making 88. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place, for the last 88 pages:\n\n- 0: 10\n- 1: 10\n- 2: 10\n- 3: 10\n- 4: 10\n- 5: 10\n- 6: 10\n- 7: 10\n- 8: 8\n\nSo, now, adding this to the previous 4 hundreds, which gave 40 counts for each digit in the tens place.\n\nSo, total counts in the tens place:\n\n- For 4: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50\n- For 8: 40 (from 1-400) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48\n\nWait, let me clarify. Wait, in the last 88 pages, the tens digit for 4 is 10 (from 441-450), and for 8, it's 8 (from 481-488). So, adding to the 40 each from the first 400 pages, 4 gets 40 +10=50, and 8 gets 40 +8=48.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 48 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is a bit different because it only appears in numbers from 100 onwards. So, for numbers 1-99, there is no hundreds digit. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place?\n\n- 1: 100-199, which is 100 numbers, so 100 times\n- 2: 200-299, 100 times\n- 3: 300-399, 100 times\n- 4: 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89)\n\nWait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place, we are only interested in whether the hundreds digit is 4 or 8. But looking at the hundreds digits, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit for 8 doesn't exist here.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place:\n\n- Number of 4's: 89\n- Number of 8's: 0\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each place.\n\nFirst, for the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate that: 49 +50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 +48 +0=97.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units place for 8's is 49, tens place is 48, so 49+48=97.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 97. Therefore, the difference is 188 -97=91.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does each digit appear in the units place? Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in each block of 100. Since 488 is 4*100 +88, so 4 complete hundreds and 88 extra. Each digit in units place appears 48 times, plus in the last 88 numbers (401-488), the units digits go from 1-8 (since 401 ends with 1, 402 with 2, up to 488 with 8). Wait, no, that's not correct. Actually, the last 88 numbers would be from 401 to 488, which is 88 numbers. So, the units digits would cycle through 0-9 eight times (for 80 numbers) and then 8 more numbers (481-488), which have units digits 1-8. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me correct this.\n\nWait, the units digits for 401-488:\n\n401: units digit 1\n\n402:2\n\n...\n\n410:0\n\n411:1\n\n412:2\n\n...\n\n420:0\n\n421:1\n\n422:2\n\n...\n\n430:0\n\n431:1\n\n432:2\n\n...\n\n440:0\n\n441:1\n\n442:2\n\n...\n\n450:0\n\n451:1\n\n452:2\n\n...\n\n460:0\n\n461:1\n\n462:2\n\n...\n\n470:0\n\n471:1\n\n472:2\n\n...\n\n480:0\n\n481:1\n\n482:2\n\n...\n\n488:8\n\nWait, so from 401-480, that's 80 numbers. So, units digits cycle through 0-9 eight times (since 80/10=8). So, each digit 0-9 appears 8 times in the units place from 401-480. Then, from 481-488, that's 8 more numbers, with units digits 1-8.\n\nSo, in total, from 401-488:\n\n- Each digit 0-9 appears 8 times in the units place from 401-480, and then digits 1-8 appear once more in 481-488.\n\nTherefore, for the units place:\n\n- Digit 4: 8 (from 401-480) +1 (from 481-488)=9\n- Similarly, digit 8: 8 +1=9\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the units place for 4 and 8 was 49 each. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there.\n\nWait, let me recast this. The total number of units digits from 1-488 is 488 numbers. Each digit 0-9 appears floor(488/10)=48 times, and then the remainder is 8 (since 488=48*10 +8). So, digits 1-8 would appear once more each in the units place.\n\nWait, but 488 is 48 full tens and 8 extra numbers. So, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place, and then digits 1-8 appear once more each, because the extra 8 numbers are 481-488, which have units digits 1-8.\n\nTherefore, in the units place:\n\n- Digit 4: 48 +1=49\n- Digit 8: 48 +1=49\n\nThat's correct. So, units place: 49 each.\n\nNow, tens place:\n\nFrom 1-488, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place?\n\nEach hundred block contributes 10 times each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would contribute 4*10=40 times each digit.\n\nThen, the last partial hundred (401-488) has 88 numbers, which is 8 full tens (401-410, 411-420, ..., 471-480) and 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n\nEach full ten contributes 10 times the tens digit. So, in 401-480, the tens digits go from 0-8, each appearing 10 times. Wait, no, 401-410: tens digit 0, 411-420:1, up to 471-480:7. Wait, that's 8 blocks, each contributing 10 times the tens digit. So, digits 0-7 each appear 10 times in the tens place in 401-480, and then in 481-488, the tens digit is 8, appearing 8 times.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place from 401-488:\n\n- Digits 0-7: 10 each\n- Digit 8: 8\n\nSo, total in the tens place:\n\n- For 4: 40 (from 1-400) +10 (from 401-488, where tens digit 4 is in 441-450) =50\n- For 8: 40 (from 1-400) +8 (from 481-488) =48\n\nThat's correct.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-99: no hundreds digit.\n\nFrom 100-199: hundreds digit 1, appearing 100 times.\n\nFrom 200-299: hundreds digit 2, 100 times.\n\nFrom 300-399: hundreds digit 3, 100 times.\n\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit 4, appearing 89 times (since 488-400+1=89).\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times\n- 8 appears 0 times\n\nSo, total counts:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50=99; 99+89=188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:48\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+48=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91\n\nWait, but let me double-check the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 in all of them, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nNow, for the tens place, I think I did it right. Each hundred contributes 10 times each digit, and the last partial hundred adds 10 for 4 and 8 for 8.\n\nWait, but let me check again the tens place for the last 88 pages:\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except for 8, which appears 8 times. So, in the tens place:\n\n- 0:10\n- 1:10\n- 2:10\n- 3:10\n- 4:10\n- 5:10\n- 6:10\n- 7:10\n- 8:8\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, adding to the 40 from the first 400 pages, making 50. 8 appears 8 times, adding to the 40, making 48.\n\nUnits place: both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0.\n\nSo, 4's total:49+50+89=188\n\n8's total:49+48+0=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because 91 seems a large number, but maybe that's correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position separately.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears equally. The total number of page numbers is 488. The number of times each digit appears in the units place is floor(488/10)=48, and the remainder is 8, so digits 1-8 appear once more each. Therefore, 4 and 8 each appear 48+1=49 times.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So, in 400 pages, each digit appears 40 times in the tens place. The remaining 88 pages (401-488) contribute:\n\n- From 401-480: 80 numbers, which is 8 full tens (each digit 0-7 appears 10 times)\n- From 481-488: 8 numbers, with tens digit 8, so 8 times.\n\nSo, for the tens place:\n\n- 4: 40 (from 1-400) +10 (from 441-450) =50\n- 8:40 +8=48\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\nOnly from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's:49+50+89=188\n\n8's:49+48+0=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, and hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place for 488 pages.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add 1 more occurrence each for digits 1-8.\n   - **4's:** 48 + 1 = 49\n   - **8's:** 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 40 times in the tens place from 1-400.\n   - From 401-488:\n     - Digits 0-7 each appear 10 times (401-470).\n     - Digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n   - **4's:** 40 (1-400) + 10 (441-450) = 50\n   - **8's:** 40 (1-400) + 8 (481-488) = 48\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times.\n   - **4's:** 89\n   - **8's:** 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 97 = 91\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by **91**.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " I'm going to try to break this down step by step because I'm not entirely sure how to approach it, but I think I can figure it out by considering each digit place separately.\n\nFirst, I know that each page number is printed once, starting from 1 and ending at 488. So, the page numbers go from 001 to 488, but since leading zeros aren't actually printed, the numbers are just 1 to 488. But maybe thinking about them as three-digit numbers with leading zeros (like 001, 002, ..., 488) can help me count the digits more systematically. I'm not sure if that's the right approach, but let me try it.\n\nI think I'll consider each digit place separately: the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place. For each place, I'll count how many times the digit 4 appears and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place. In the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each block of 10 numbers. For example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, each digit appears once every 10 numbers. Therefore, in the units place, the number of 4's and 8's can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then checking if there's any remainder.\n\nTotal pages: 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. That means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 pages and an extra 8 pages. In each block, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 appears once. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 times 1 plus the number of 4's in the extra 8 pages. Wait, but the extra pages go from 481 to 488, so their units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in the units place, there's one more 4 (at 484) and one more 8 (at 488). So, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, the count is equal.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often every 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), then 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), and so on up to 9 (90-99). Each digit appears 10 times in each block of 100. So, for the tens place, the number of 4's and 8's can be calculated by considering how many complete hundreds are there and any partial hundreds.\n\nTotal pages: 488. So, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). For each complete hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each, so each digit appears 10 times in the tens place per hundred. So, for 4 complete hundreds, the number of 4's in the tens place is 4 * 10 = 40, and the number of 8's is also 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nNow, for the partial hundred from 401 to 488, which is 88 pages. Let's see how the tens digits behave here. The tens digit goes from 0 (for 401-410) to 8 (for 480-488). Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times, except for the last one, which only goes up to 88. Wait, actually, from 401 to 488, the tens digits are as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0 (10 numbers)\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1 (10 numbers)\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2 (10 numbers)\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3 (10 numbers)\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4 (10 numbers)\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5 (10 numbers)\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6 (10 numbers)\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7 (10 numbers)\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8 (8 numbers)\n\nSo, in this partial hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (from 441-450), and the tens digit 8 appears 8 times (from 481-488). Therefore, in the tens place, the total number of 4's is 40 (from the complete hundreds) + 10 (from the partial hundred) = 50, and the number of 8's is 40 + 8 = 48. So, in the tens place, there are 50 4's and 48 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only non-zero for page numbers 100 and above. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, which doesn't contribute any 4's or 8's. From 100-488, the hundreds digit cycles as follows:\n\n- 100-199: hundreds digit is 1\n- 200-299: hundreds digit is 2\n- 300-399: hundreds digit is 3\n- 400-488: hundreds digit is 4\n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 pages (400-488 inclusive). So, the number of 4's in the hundreds place is 89. The hundreds digit is never 8 in this book because the book ends at 488, so the hundreds digit only goes up to 4. Therefore, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each place:\n\n- Units place:\n  - 4's: 49\n  - 8's: 49\n- Tens place:\n  - 4's: 50\n  - 8's: 48\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 4's: 89\n  - 8's: 0\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 48 is 97.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 91.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting with the units place: 488 pages. Each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place (since 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full times, and then the last 8 pages add one more 4 and one more 8). So, 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4's and 8's. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: 488 pages. Each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40 for each digit. Then, the partial hundred from 401-488: the tens digit cycles through 0-8, each appearing 10 times except the last one, which is 8 and appears 8 times. So, for 4's in the tens place, that's 10 times, and for 8's, it's 8 times. So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 8 = 48 for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 1-99, hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's. From 100-488, hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 4's in the hundreds place occur from 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, 89 4's. No 8's in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so hundreds digit never reaches 8. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I calculated the units place, I considered 488 as 48 full tens and 8 extra pages. So, the units digits go up to 488, which is correct.\n\nIn the tens place, I considered each hundred, so 1-100, 101-200, etc., each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. Then, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, I correctly accounted for 10 4's and 8 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, the 4's in 401-488: when the tens digit is 4, the pages are 440-449, but wait, 401-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 pages, so that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, the tens digit 8 in the last partial hundred is from 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488 inclusive), but wait, 480-488 is 9 pages, not 8. Wait, 480, 481, ..., 488: that's 9 numbers. Wait, so I think I made a mistake here. Let me recount.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488: that's 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times, not 8 times. So, in the partial hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times, not 8. Therefore, my earlier calculation was wrong.\n\nSo, in the tens place, for the partial hundred 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times, not 8. Therefore, the total number of 8's in the tens place is 40 (from the complete hundreds) + 9 (from the partial hundred) = 49, not 48.\n\nWait, that changes things. Let me recalculate.\n\nSo, units place: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nTens place: 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\nHundreds place: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, so I initially thought 91, but upon correcting the count in the tens place, it's 90. Let me confirm again.\n\nIn the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. Therefore, in the tens place, the number of 8's is 40 + 9 = 49, not 48. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nTotal 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 188.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. From 401-488, how many times does the tens digit 8 appear? It's from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 9 times, correct.\n\nSimilarly, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. So, in the tens place, 4's: 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nTherefore, the total 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have another mistake. Let me check the hundreds place again.\n\nFrom 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place. From 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except for the last one, which is 8, appearing 9 times because the book ends at 488. So, for the tens digit 8, it's 9 times, and for the tens digit 4, it's 10 times.\n\nSo, the tens place contributes 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\nUnits place: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nHundreds place: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference was 91, but after correcting the tens place, it's 90. So, I think 90 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. The units digits go from 1 to 488. So, the number of times each digit appears in the units place is floor(488 / 10) = 48 times each digit, plus the remainder, which is 8. So, for digits 1-8, they get an extra count because the last page is 488, which ends with 8, so digits 1-8 each get one more count, but wait, no, actually, the units digits from 1 to 8 would each get one more count because the last page is 488, which is page 488, so units digit 8. Wait, but actually, the units digits from 1 to 8 would each get one more count only if the remainder is greater than or equal to their digit. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to consider that the units digit cycles every 10 pages. So, for 488 pages, there are 48 full cycles of 10, and then 8 extra pages (481-488). In each full cycle, each digit from 0-9 appears once in the units place. So, in 48 full cycles, each digit appears 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, each of these digits appears once more. Therefore, the total count for each digit in the units place is 48 + 1 if the digit is \u22648, because the extra pages go up to 8. So, digits 1-8 get 49 counts, and digits 9 and 0 get 48 counts.\n\nWait, but wait, 0 doesn't appear in the units place for page 1, right? Page 1 is 1, page 10 is 10, so the units digit 0 appears in 10, 20, ..., 480. So, in the units place, 0 appears 48 times (from 10,20,...,480). But in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 0 doesn't appear there. So, 0 in units place is 48 times, and digits 1-8 appear 48 +1 =49 times each, and digits 9 appears 48 times (since the last page is 488, which doesn't include 489, so 9 only appears up to 489, which isn't there). So, 9 appears 48 times.\n\nWait, but in the units place, digits 1-8 appear 49 times each, and 0 and 9 appear 48 times each. So, 4 appears 49 times, and 8 appears 49 times in the units place. That part is correct.\n\nIn the tens place, as we determined earlier, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times and 8's appear 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference was 91, but after correcting the tens place, it's 90. So, I think 90 is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, right? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nAnd in the tens place, the 4's are 50 and 8's are 49.\n\nUnits place: both 4 and 8 are 49.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 +50 +89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " I need to find the difference between the count of 4's and 8's. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should figure out how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488. Then, I'll do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to get the answer.\n\nLet me start by understanding how digits are counted in page numbers. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since 488 is a three-digit number, I'll need to consider all three places: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nI remember that to count the number of times a specific digit appears, it's helpful to look at each digit position separately. So, I'll consider the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place for both 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place.\n   - How many such blocks are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and an additional 8 numbers (481-488).\n   - In each full block, there's one 4 in the units place. So, 48 blocks give 48 fours.\n   - Now, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. The digit 4 appears once here (484).\n   - So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n   - How many full hundreds are there in 488? That's 4 (since 4*100=400). But wait, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages, so actually, it's 4 full hundreds and a partial hundred.\n   - In each full hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, 4 hundreds give 4*10 = 40 fours.\n   - Now, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 fours.\n   - Wait, no. Wait, 400-488 is the partial hundred. The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 fours.\n   - So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.\n   - So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Yes, that seems right.\n\nNow, moving on to the digit 8:\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4, in every block of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 full blocks of 10 (since 488/10=48.8) and an additional 8 numbers (481-488).\n   - Each full block gives 1 eight, so 48 eights.\n   - In the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so the digit 8 appears once here (488).\n   - So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit is 8 in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - In each block of 100, this happens once, giving 10 eights in the tens place.\n   - How many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, etc.).\n   - So, 4 full hundreds give 4*10 = 40 eights.\n   - Now, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since 488 is the last page, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears 9 times here.\n   - So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The tens digit cycles every 100. So, in 1-100, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (80-89). Similarly, in 101-200, it's 180-189, another 10. So, up to 400, it's 4*10=40. Now, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489. But since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 eights in the tens place in the partial hundred. So, total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book is only up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems a bit low. Let me double-check the tens place. In the partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 eights in the tens place. So, 40 from full hundreds plus 9 gives 49. So, 49 in tens, 49 in units, total 98. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 8. Since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488, and 0 in 1-399. So, yes, hundreds place for 8 is 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 48 full blocks (1-480) give 48 fours. Then, 481-488: 484 is the only one with a 4 in units. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\n- Tens: Each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place. 4 hundreds (1-400) give 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, total 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 48 full blocks (1-480) give 48 eights. Then, 481-488: 488 is the only one with an 8 in units. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Tens: Each hundred has 10 eights in the tens place. 4 hundreds (1-400) give 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n- Hundreds: 0, as before.\n\nSo, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I just realized that in the tens place for 8's, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but 488 is included. So, that's correct.\n\nWait another thought: When counting the hundreds place for 4's, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. Let me confirm that: 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place for 4's, 481-488 includes 484, which is correct.\n\nI think my counts are accurate. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full decades (1-480) contribute 48 fours. The last partial decade (481-488) adds 1 four (484). Total: 49.\n- **Tens place:** Each hundred contributes 10 fours (e.g., 40-49). Four full hundreds (1-400) give 40 fours. The partial hundred (401-488) adds 10 fours (440-449). Total: 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 contribute 89 fours. Total: 89.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full decades (1-480) contribute 48 eights. The last partial decade (481-488) adds 1 eight (488). Total: 49.\n- **Tens place:** Each hundred contributes 10 eights (e.g., 80-89). Four full hundreds (1-400) give 40 eights. The partial hundred (401-488) adds 9 eights (480-488). Total: 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No pages reach 800, so 0 eights.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by understanding how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number since 488 is a three-digit number. So, I'll have to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nI remember that to count the number of times a specific digit appears, I can break down the problem by each digit position. So, I'll handle the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place separately for both 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:** I need to count how many times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. Every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9, so each digit, including 4, appears once every 10 numbers. So, for the units place, the number of 4's would be the total number of complete groups of 10 in 488, which is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a group, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, I think I might be missing something here. Because from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10, so the number of times 4 appears in the units place is actually the number of times 4 is in the units place for each set of 10. So, for each set of 10, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction, it's 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. But wait, the last set might not be complete. Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the last set is 481-490, but since the book only goes up to 488, the units digit 4 in 484 is included, and 494 would be beyond 488, so actually, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 times, right? Because from 4 to 484, that's 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the units digit goes up to 8 in 488. So, the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, yes, 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, from 101 to 200, it's 140-149, another 10 times. This pattern continues. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds. Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place, so that's 4*10 = 40. But wait, we also have the 400-488 range. In this range, the tens digit is 4 from 400-409, 410-419, etc., but actually, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, 480-489. Wait, no, that's not right. The tens digit is 4 when the tens place is 4, so from 400-409, the tens digit is 0, so that's not 4. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me correct this. The tens digit is 4 when the number is in the form X4Y, where X is the hundreds digit and Y is the units digit. So, for each hundreds group, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So, how many full hundreds are there? Let's see: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. That's 4*10=40. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10, making it 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's 10 more. So, total 4's in the tens place is 50.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10. In 201-300, it's 240-249, another 10. In 301-400, it's 340-349, another 10. And in 401-488, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50. So, yes, 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units: 48, tens:50, hundreds:89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. Yes.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** How many times does 8 appear in the units place? Similar to 4, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles, so 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, total number of 8's in the units place is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. But wait, the last set is 481-490, but the book ends at 488, so the last 8 in the units place is 488, which is included. So, the number of 8's in the units place is 48 times.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The last term is 488, which is 8*61=488. Wait, 8*61=488? Wait, 8*60=480, plus 8 is 488. So, 61 terms? Wait, that can't be right because 488 is the 61st term if we count every 10 numbers. Wait, no, because 488 is the 488th page, but in terms of units digit 8, it's every 10 pages. So, the number of 8's in the units place is the number of times 8 appears in the units digit from 1 to 488.\n\nSo, the formula is floor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10)=48.9, which is 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 times. Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the number of times the units digit is 8 is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488, which is 48, plus 1 if the last page is beyond 480. Wait, 488 is 480 + 8, so the units digit 8 occurs once more at 488. So, the total number of 8's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49. Because from 1-480, there are 48 occurrences (8,18,...,478), and then 488 is another one, making it 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 48, but now I'm getting 49. Let me check with an example. Let's say up to page 10: pages 8 is one occurrence. Up to page 20: 8 and 18, so two. Up to page 30: three, etc. So, up to page 480, which is 48*10, there are 48 occurrences. Then, page 488 is another one, so total 49. So, yes, units place 8's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, let's calculate:\n\n- From 1-100: 80-89, which is 10 numbers.\n- From 101-200: 180-189, another 10.\n- From 201-300: 280-289, another 10.\n- From 301-400: 380-389, another 10.\n- From 401-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page).\n\nSo, total 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, let me confirm. Each hundred contributes 10, except the last one, which contributes 9 because 488 is the end. So, 4 full hundreds (1-400) contributing 10 each, that's 40, plus the last partial hundred (401-488) contributing 9, so total 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** How many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, let me check again:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal: 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's was 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units:48\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:48+50=98; 98+89=187.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:187-98=89.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's is 89 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Each page is numbered once, starting from 1 and ending at 488. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears and how many times the digit 8 appears, then subtract the two to find the difference.\n\nFirst, I think I should break this down by looking at each digit place separately: the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place. Since the book has 488 pages, the hundreds place can only be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, right? But actually, since the first page is 1, the hundreds digit starts at 0 (for pages 1-99), then 1 (for 100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and finally 4 (400-488).\n\nWait, no, actually, the hundreds digit for 400-488 would be 4, but the hundreds digit for 1-99 would be 0, so I need to consider each of these ranges separately.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place first. In the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each block of 10 pages. So, for example, in pages 1-10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (page 4), and the digit 8 appears once (page 8). Similarly, this pattern repeats every 10 pages.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 pages (pages 481-488).\n\nIn each complete block of 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 appears once. So for 48 complete blocks, that's 48 times each. Then, in the partial block (pages 481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once (page 484) and the digit 8 appears once (page 488). So, in the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's, 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, they are equal.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears in a block of 100 pages. For example, in pages 1-100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 pages: 40-49. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 pages: 80-89. So, each digit appears 10 times per 100 pages.\n\nNow, how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred from 401-488.\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the digit 8 appears 10 times. So, for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times each.\n\nNow, the partial hundred from 401-488. Let's see how the tens digit behaves here. Pages 401-409: the tens digit is 0. Pages 410-419: tens digit is 1, and so on up to pages 480-488: tens digit is 8.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me correct that. Pages 401-410: tens digit is 0. Pages 411-420: tens digit is 1, and so on. So, in the range 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does each appear?\n\nFrom 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles through 0 to 8. Each tens digit appears 10 times except for the last one, which might be shorter. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the tens digit goes up to 8, but how many times does each digit appear?\n\nWait, let's think about it. From 401 to 488, that's 88 pages. The tens digits go from 0 (401-410) which is 10 pages, then 1 (411-420), another 10, and so on up to 8 (481-490). Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 481-488 is 8 pages, not 10. So, for tens digits 0-7, each appears 10 times, and for tens digit 8, it's 8 pages (481-488). So, the digit 8 in the tens place appears 8 times in this partial hundred.\n\nWait, but I'm only looking for the tens place. So, in the partial hundred, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see: when the tens digit is 4, that's pages 440-449, which is 10 pages. But since the book only goes up to 488, pages 440-449 are all included because 449 is less than 488. So, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times in this partial hundred.\n\nSimilarly, the tens digit 8 appears in pages 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488), but wait, 480 is included, so 480-488 is 9 pages? Wait, no, 480 is page 480, then 481, 482, ..., up to 488, which is 9 pages. Wait, but that's 9 pages, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the partial hundred.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 8 pages, but 480-488 is 9 pages. Let me check: 480 is one, then 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So that's 9 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the partial hundred.\n\nWait, but I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 8, but now it's 9. Let me recount: from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the partial hundred.\n\nTherefore, in the partial hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, the total number of 4's is 4 complete hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 10 in the partial hundred, totaling 50.\n\nThe total number of 8's in the tens place is 4 complete hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 9 in the partial hundred, totaling 49.\n\nWait, so in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times. So, the difference here is 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in each complete hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9, each appearing 10 times. So, 4 appears 10 times per hundred, and 8 appears 10 times per hundred. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 40 each.\n\nIn the partial hundred, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear?\n\nFrom 401-488, that's 88 pages. The tens digits go from 0 (401-410) which is 10 pages, 1 (411-420) which is 10, and so on up to 7 (471-480) which is 10 pages, and then 8 (481-488) which is 8 pages. Wait, that doesn't add up because 10*8 +8=88, which matches.\n\nWait, so in the partial hundred, the tens digit 8 appears in pages 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times. So, I think I made a mistake earlier when I said it's 9 times. It's actually 8 times because 481-488 is 8 pages: 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 8 pages, so 8 times.\n\nWait, but 488 - 481 +1 = 8, so yes, 8 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in the partial hundred.\n\nSimilarly, the tens digit 4 appears in pages 440-449, which is 10 pages, all within 488, so 10 times.\n\nTherefore, in the partial hundred, 4's in tens place: 10, 8's in tens place:8.\n\nSo, total in tens place: 4's = 4*10 +10=50, 8's=4*10 +8=48.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's are 50, 8's are 48, so 4's are 2 more than 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, no, 4 complete hundreds: each contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 for both.\n\nIn the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times.\n\nThe tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages? Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488. Wait, 480 is page 480, which is the start of the tens digit 8, and 488 is the end. So, how many pages have 8 in the tens place in 401-488?\n\nIt's from 480 to 488, which is 9 pages: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 pages, so 9 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 8 pages. Wait, 480 is included, so 480 is the first page with 8 in the tens place, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 480 +1 =9 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the partial hundred.\n\nSo, in the partial hundred, 4's in tens place:10, 8's in tens place:9.\n\nSo, total in tens place: 4's=40+10=50, 8's=40+9=49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's are 50, 8's are 49, so 4's are 1 more than 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, that's consistent now. So, in the tens place, 4's are 50, 8's are 49, so 4's are 1 more.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, the digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. Pages 1-99 have hundreds digit 0, pages 100-199 have 1, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (488-400+1=89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, because 800 is beyond 488. So, the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, the number of 4's is 89, and the number of 8's is 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the digits:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's=49+50+89=188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's=49+49+0=98\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 49 for both 4's and 8's, which seems correct because each digit from 0-9 appears equally in the units place across all pages.\n\nIn the tens place, 4's were 50 and 8's were 49, so that's a difference of +1 for 4's.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4's were 89 and 8's were 0, so that's a difference of +89 for 4's.\n\nSo, total difference is 1 (from tens) +89 (from hundreds) =90. So, 4's are 90 more than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, that's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, I had 50 for 4's and 49 for 8's, so that's +1.\n\nIn the units place, they were equal, so no difference.\n\nSo, total difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot, but maybe that's correct.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's and 8's in each place.\n\nUnits place:\n\nTotal pages:488\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears in the units place every 10 pages.\n\nNumber of complete tens:48 (since 48*10=480), with 8 remaining pages (481-488).\n\nIn each complete ten, 4 appears once, 8 appears once.\n\nSo, 48*1=48 for both.\n\nIn the remaining 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1-8.\n\nSo, 4 appears once (484), 8 appears once (488).\n\nSo, total units place:48+1=49 for both.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n\nNumber of complete hundreds:4 (1-100,101-200,201-300,301-400).\n\nEach contributes 10 for 4 and 10 for 8.\n\nSo, 4*10=40 for both.\n\nPartial hundred:401-488.\n\nIn this range, the tens digits go from 0 to 8.\n\nFor each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear?\n\nFrom 401-488, that's 88 pages.\n\nThe tens digits cycle every 10 pages, so:\n\n- Tens digit 0:401-410 (10 pages)\n- Tens digit 1:411-420 (10)\n- Tens digit 2:421-430 (10)\n- Tens digit 3:431-440 (10)\n- Tens digit 4:441-450 (10)\n- Tens digit 5:451-460 (10)\n- Tens digit 6:461-470 (10)\n- Tens digit 7:471-480 (10)\n- Tens digit 8:481-488 (8 pages)\n\nWait, that's 8 tens digits, each appearing 10 times except for 8, which appears 8 times.\n\nWait, but that's 8*10 +8=88, which matches.\n\nSo, in the partial hundred, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times.\n\nTens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times.\n\nSo, in the partial hundred, 4's in tens place:10, 8's in tens place:8.\n\nTherefore, total in tens place:\n\n4's:40 (from complete hundreds) +10=50\n\n8's:40 +8=48\n\nSo, in tens place, 4's are 50, 8's are 48.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 400-488, that's 89 pages, each with hundreds digit 4.\n\nSo, 4's in hundreds place:89\n\n8's in hundreds place:0\n\nNow, total counts:\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n\n8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0=97\n\nWait, earlier I thought 8's were 98, but now I'm getting 97. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the tens place, 8's were 48, and units place 49, so total 8's=49+48=97.\n\nSo, 4's=188, 8's=97, difference=188-97=91.\n\nWait, now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 90, but now it's 91.\n\nWait, let's recount:\n\nUnits place:4's=49, 8's=49\n\nTens place:4's=50, 8's=48\n\nHundreds place:4's=89, 8's=0\n\nSo, total 4's=49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's=49+48+0=97\n\nDifference=188-97=91\n\nHmm, so I must have made a mistake earlier in adding.\n\nWait, so the correct difference is 91.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again.\n\nIn the partial hundred, 4's in tens place:10, 8's:8\n\nSo, 4's in tens place:40+10=50\n\n8's in tens place:40+8=48\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nUnits place:49 each\n\nHundreds place:89 for 4's, 0 for 8's.\n\nSo, 4's total:49+50+89=188\n\n8's total:49+48+0=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91\n\nSo, the correct answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 90, but now it's 91. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial calculation.\n\nWait, let me check the 8's in the tens place again.\n\nIn the partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times.\n\nSo, 4's in tens place:10, 8's:8.\n\nSo, 4's in tens:40+10=50\n\n8's in tens:40+8=48\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 4's:49+50+89=188\n\n8's:49+48+0=97\n\nDifference=188-97=91\n\nSo, the correct answer is 91.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 90, but I must have miscalculated the 8's in the tens place as 9 instead of 8.\n\nWait, let me confirm the number of pages in the partial hundred.\n\nFrom 401-488, that's 88 pages.\n\nEach tens digit from 0-8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which is 8, appearing 8 times.\n\nSo, tens digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place.\n\nTherefore, 8's in tens place:40+8=48\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total difference is 91.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because I thought initially it was 90, but after careful recounting, it's 91.\n\nWait, let me try another approach to verify.\n\nAnother way to calculate the number of times a digit appears in each place is to consider each digit place separately.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) + (if the last digit is >=4, add 1). Wait, no, more accurately, it's (488 // 10) * 1 + min(max(488 % 10 -4 +1,0),10). Wait, maybe it's better to think as:\n\nIn the units place, each digit 0-9 appears equally in each block of 10. So, for 488 pages, there are 48 full tens (480 pages) and 8 extra pages.\n\nIn each full ten, 4 appears once, so 48 times.\n\nIn the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484).\n\nSo, total 4's in units place:48+1=49\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place:48+1=49\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in tens place:\n\nEach hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place.\n\nSo, for 488 pages, there are 4 full hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10 times for 4 in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place:40+10=50\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place:\n\nEach full hundred contributes 10 times, so 4*10=40.\n\nIn the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 8 pages, but 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9 times.\n\nWait, but now I'm confused again.\n\nWait, 480-488 is 9 pages:480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488.\n\nSo, that's 9 pages, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the partial hundred.\n\nSo, total 8's in tens place:40+9=49\n\nWait, so that's different from before. So, now I'm getting 49 for 8's in tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 8 pages, but it's actually 9 pages because 480 is included.\n\nSo, this changes the count.\n\nSo, 4's in tens place:50\n\n8's in tens place:49\n\nSo, difference in tens place:1\n\nIn hundreds place:\n\n4's:89\n\n8's:0\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nWait, now I'm getting 90 again. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, in the partial hundred, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times.\n\nSo, 8's in tens place:40+9=49\n\nThus, total 8's:49+49=98\n\n4's:49+50+89=188\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nWait, so that's 90.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that in the partial hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times because 481-488 is 8 pages, but that's incorrect because 480 is included, making it 9 pages.\n\nSo, the correct count is 9 times for 8's in the tens place in the partial hundred.\n\nTherefore, total 8's in tens place:40+9=49\n\nSo, total 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98\n\n4's:49+50+89=188\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nSo, the correct answer is 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 91, but that was because I mistakenly counted 8's in the tens place as 8 times in the partial hundred, but it's actually 9 times.\n\nSo, the correct difference is 90.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the number of times the digits 4 and 8 appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference between their counts.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears equally in the units place every 10 pages.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks of 10 pages (480 pages) and 8 extra pages (481-488).\n   - In each block, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place.\n   - Total for 48 blocks: 48 each.\n   - In the extra 8 pages, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n   - **Total 4's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n   - **Total 8's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears in the tens place every 100 pages, each for 10 pages.\n   - There are 4 complete hundreds (1-400) and a partial hundred (401-488).\n   - In each complete hundred, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place.\n   - **Total for 4 complete hundreds:** 4 * 10 = 40 each.\n   - In the partial hundred (401-488):\n     - 4 appears in the tens place from 440-449 (10 pages).\n     - 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488 (9 pages).\n   - **Total 4's in tens place:** 40 + 10 = 50\n   - **Total 8's in tens place:** 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0.\n   - Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1.\n   - Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2.\n   - Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3.\n   - Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4.\n   - **Total 4's in hundreds place:** 488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n   - **Total 8's in hundreds place:** 0\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - **188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90**\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Each page is printed once, starting from page 1 up to page 488.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem clearly. I have to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nSo, the approach is to count the number of 4's and 8's separately and then find the difference. Let me start by breaking down the problem into smaller parts.\n\nI think the best way is to consider each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Since 488 is a three-digit number, I can analyze each digit place one by one.\n\nLet's start with the units place. For each complete set of ten pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (e.g., 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the digit 8 appears once as well (e.g., 8, 18, 28, etc.).\n\nNow, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten and an additional 8 pages (from 481 to 488). So, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times, except for the last partial set.\n\nWait, but actually, in each complete set of ten, each digit appears exactly once in the units place. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48, and the number of 8's is also 48. But we have an extra 8 pages beyond 480, so in the units place, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial set, the digit 8 appears once more in the units place (page 488). So, for the units place, the count of 4's is 48, and the count of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, no, let me check that again. The last set is from 481 to 488, which is 8 pages. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears once (page 484), and the digit 8 appears once (page 488). So, actually, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 (from the complete sets) plus 1 (from the last partial set) = 49. Similarly, the number of 8's is 48 (from the complete sets) plus 1 (from the last partial set) = 49. Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought the 8's would be 49, but the 4's would also be 49. That would mean they're equal, but I know that's not the case because the total number of 4's and 8's might differ in other digit places.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the units place. Let me re-examine.\n\nEach complete set of ten pages (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Since there are 48 complete sets (because 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8), each digit appears 48 times in the units place. Then, the last partial set is pages 481-488, which is 8 pages. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's. So, both have 49 in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, in pages 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 11-19, 2 for 21-29, and so on up to 9 for 91-99. Similarly, in 101-200, the tens digit cycles again.\n\nTo find how many times 4 appears in the tens place, we can consider each hundred block. In each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive pages: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, etc. Each of these contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive pages: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, etc.\n\nNow, let's calculate how many times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nFirst, the total number of hundreds in 488 pages is 4 (since 488 \u00f7 100 = 4.88). So, we have four complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Then, the last partial hundred is 401-488.\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 40-49). So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 times. Now, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is 4 8 8). So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, in the partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Therefore, total number of 4's in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but wait, 401-488 is 88 pages. The tens digit in 401-488 ranges from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, yes, 10 times. So, total 4's in tens place: 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 10 in the last partial hundred, totaling 50.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place: in each complete hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages (since 488 is included). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 pages: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the last partial hundred. So, total number of 8's in the tens place is 40 (from the four hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 pages because 480 is the first page with tens digit 8, and 488 is the last. So, from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 pages. So, 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nTherefore, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only non-zero for pages 100 and above. So, pages 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit, so the hundreds place is 0. Pages 100-199 have a hundreds digit of 1, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4.\n\nSo, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488. How many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nThe digit 8 in the hundreds place would be if the book had pages beyond 800, but since it's only 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor digit 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from the total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n- Each set of 10 pages has one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n- 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1 each, so 48 for 4's and 48 for 8's.\n- The last 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place total: 4's = 48 + 1 = 49, 8's = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n- For 4's: Each hundred has 10 occurrences (e.g., 40-49). There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n- The last partial hundred (401-488) includes 440-449, which is another 10 occurrences. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n- For 8's: Each hundred has 10 occurrences (e.g., 80-89). 4 full hundreds give 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n- The last partial hundred (401-488) includes 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 occurrences.

    "text": " Each page is printed once, starting from 1 and ending at 488. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears and how many times the digit 8 appears, and then find the difference between these two counts.\n\nFirst, I think I should break down the problem by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That way, I can systematically count the number of 4's and 8's in each place.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for the digit 8 (like 8, 18, 28, etc.). \n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then an extra 8 pages. So, in each of these 48 blocks, both 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. That gives us 48 times for 4 and 48 times for 8 in the units place.\n\nBut wait, there are 8 extra pages after the 480th page, which are 481 to 488. In these, the units digits are 1 through 8. So, in the units place of these extra pages, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, adding that to our counts, we have 48 + 1 = 49 times for 4 and 48 + 1 = 49 times for 8 in the units place.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because 488 is the last page, so the units digits go up to 8. So, in the extra 8 pages, 481 to 488, the units digits are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So, the units place for 4 is 48 (from the blocks) + 1 = 49, and similarly for 8, it's 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, both digits appear 49 times each.\n\nNext, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for every 100 numbers.\n\nSo, for the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's think: from 40-49, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 times. Similarly, from 140-149, 240-249, etc., each of these decades contributes another 10 times. But we have to check up to 488.\n\nFirst, let's find how many hundreds are there. 488 is less than 500, so we have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488.\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 4 complete hundreds, so 4 times 10 = 40 times for 4 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but actually, in the first hundred (1-100), the tens digit for 4 is from 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, in the second hundred (101-200), it's 140-149, another 10 times, and so on up to the fourth hundred (301-400), which is 340-349. So, that's 4 times 10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that's another 10 times. So, total for the tens place, 40 (from the four complete hundreds) + 10 = 50 times.\n\nWait, that doesn't sound right. Let me check again. Each complete hundred (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) contributes 10 times for 4 in the tens place. So, four complete hundreds give 4*10=40. Then, in the incomplete hundred, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place, let's do the same. In each complete hundred, the tens digit 8 occurs in 80-89, which is 10 times per hundred. So, four complete hundreds give 4*10=40 times. Now, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes up to 8, so 80-88 is within 480-488. So, in the tens place, 8 occurs 10 times in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 times? Wait, no. Wait, 480-489 would be the tens digit 8, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers: 480, 481,...,488. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the incomplete hundred.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, each occurrence is a full set of 10 numbers. So, in 480-489, the tens digit is 8, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the incomplete hundred. Therefore, total 8's in the tens place would be 4*10 (from complete hundreds) + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, that seems inconsistent. Let me think again. For each complete hundred, the tens digit 8 occurs in 80-89, which is 10 times. So, four complete hundreds would give 4*10=40 times. Then, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. Therefore, total 8's in the tens place would be 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but in the incomplete hundred, the tens digit 8 is from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, in the incomplete hundred, it's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit cycles every 1000, so in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit never reaches 8 because 800 would be beyond 488. So, 8 does not appear in the hundreds place at all. Therefore, 8's in the hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the question is asking how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check each part to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n- Each block of 10 has one 4 and one 8.\n- 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each.\n- Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once more, making it 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- For 4's:\n  - Each hundred contributes 10 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n  - Four complete hundreds: 4*10=40.\n  - In the incomplete hundred (401-488), 440-449 is 10 times, so total 50. Correct.\n- For 8's:\n  - Each hundred contributes 10 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n  - Four complete hundreds: 4*10=40.\n  - In the incomplete hundred, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times, total 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times. Correct.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. That's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: For 4's, the hundreds digit contributes 89, which is a significant number. The 8's don't have any in the hundreds place, so that's why the difference is so large.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. In the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. So, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, 9 times, not 10. So, 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, in the incomplete hundred, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times, making it 50. Correct.\n\nI think the calculations are correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each block of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n- 488 pages = 48 full blocks of 10 + 8 extra pages.\n- 48 blocks contribute 48 each of 4's and 8's.\n- The extra 8 pages (481-488) contribute one 4 and one 8.\n- **Total in units place:** 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n- Four complete hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 each of 4's and 8's.\n- In the incomplete hundred (401-488):\n  - 4's: 440-449 (10 times).\n  - 8's: 480-488 (9 times).\n- **Total in tens place:** 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- 4's: 400-488 contributes 89 4's.\n- 8's: No pages have 8 in the hundreds place.\n- **Total in hundreds place:** 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page is printed once, starting from page 1 up to page 488.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the problem is asking. It's about counting the number of times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and comparing that to the number of times the digit 8 appears. The difference between these two counts will give me the answer.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to break down the problem by looking at each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to three digits. So, I'll need to consider each digit position individually for both 4 and 8.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every set of ten consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. For example, in 1-10, the 4 is in page 4 and the 8 is in page 8. This pattern repeats every ten numbers.\n\nNow, how many such sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of ten and then an additional 8 pages (481-488). So, for the units place, each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times, except for the last partial set where digits 1-8 appear once more.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place because each set of ten contributes one of each digit. But in the last partial set, which is pages 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, the digits 1-8 each appear once more, and 9 and 0 don't appear in this partial set.\n\nSo, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 (from the full sets) plus 1 (from the partial set, since 484 is in the last set), making it 49. Similarly, the number of 8's in the units place is 48 plus 1, which is 49 as well. Wait, that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so 488 is included, so 8 appears in the units place as 488. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, when I divide 488 by 10, I get 48 full sets (1-480) and then 481-488 as the remaining 8 pages. So, in each full set of 10, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so each digit appears 48 times. Then, in the partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so digits 1-8 each appear once more. So, for the units place:\n\n- Number of 4's: 48 (from full sets) + 1 (from 484) = 49\n- Number of 8's: 48 (from full sets) + 1 (from 488) = 49\n\nSo, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. So, the difference in the units place is 0.\n\nNext, I'll move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, in the range 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, ..., up to 9 for 90-99. So, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place for every 100 numbers.\n\nNow, considering the book has 488 pages, let's break it down:\n\n- From 1-99: There are 100 pages, so the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. Wait, no, actually, from 1-99, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) and then 1-9 for 10-99. So, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place from 1-99.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. From 1-99, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9 (9 numbers), 1 for 10-19 (10 numbers), 2 for 20-29 (10 numbers), ..., up to 9 for 90-99 (10 numbers). So, the digit 0 appears 9 times (pages 1-9), and digits 1-9 each appear 10 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, no, that's not right either. Wait, from 1-9, the tens digit is 0, but those are 9 numbers, so 0 appears 9 times. From 10-99, each tens digit from 1-9 appears exactly 10 times (e.g., 10-19: 10 times the digit 1 in the tens place). So, in total, from 1-99, the tens digit 0 appears 9 times, and each digit from 1-9 appears 10 times.\n\nThen, from 100-199, the tens digit cycles again from 0-9, each appearing 10 times. Similarly, from 200-299, and so on, up to 400-488.\n\nWait, but 488 is less than 500, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4. Let me structure this properly.\n\nFirst, let's consider the tens digit:\n\n- Pages 1-99: Tens digits go from 0 (1-9) and 1-9 (10-99). So, 0 appears 9 times, 1-9 each appear 10 times.\n- Pages 100-199: Tens digits cycle from 0-9, each appearing 10 times. So, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times.\n- Similarly, pages 200-299: same as above.\n- Pages 300-399: same.\n- Pages 400-488: Now, this is a partial set. Let's see how many times each tens digit appears.\n\nSo, for each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit cycles 0-9, each appearing 10 times. So, each of these contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the last partial hundred, 400-488, we need to see how many times each tens digit appears.\n\nFrom 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, let's count:\n\n- Tens digit 0: pages 400-409: 10 pages, so digit 0 appears 10 times.\n- Tens digit 1: 410-419: 10 pages.\n- Similarly, up to tens digit 8: 480-488: 9 pages (since 488 is the last page).\n\nWait, no, 480-488 is 9 pages: 480,481,...,488. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in this partial set.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400-488 is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, the tens digits go from 0 to 8.\n\n- Tens digit 0: 400-409: 10 pages.\n- Tens digit 1: 410-419: 10 pages.\n- Tens digit 2: 420-429: 10 pages.\n- Tens digit 3: 430-439: 10 pages.\n- Tens digit 4: 440-449: 10 pages.\n- Tens digit 5: 450-459: 10 pages.\n- Tens digit 6: 460-469: 10 pages.\n- Tens digit 7: 470-479: 10 pages.\n- Tens digit 8: 480-488: 9 pages.\n\nSo, in the partial set 400-488, the tens digits 0-7 each appear 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nTherefore, for the tens place, let's calculate the total number of times each digit appears.\n\nFirst, from 1-99:\n\n- 0: 9 times\n- 1-9: 10 times each\n\nFrom 100-399: three sets of 100, each contributing 10 times per digit in the tens place.\n\nSo, for each digit 0-9, in the tens place from 100-399: 3 sets \u00d7 10 = 30 times each.\n\nThen, from 400-488:\n\n- 0-7: 10 times each\n- 8: 9 times\n\nSo, adding up:\n\nFor digit 4 in the tens place:\n\nFrom 1-99: 10 times\nFrom 100-399: 30 times\nFrom 400-488: 10 times (since 4 is in the tens place from 440-449)\nTotal for 4 in tens place: 10 + 30 +10 = 50 times.\n\nWait, no, let me correct that. From 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times.\n\nSo, total for 4 in tens place: 10 (from 1-99) + 30 (from 100-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 50 times.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8 in the tens place:\n\nFrom 1-99: 10 times\nFrom 100-399: 30 times\nFrom 400-488: 9 times\nTotal for 8 in tens place: 10 + 30 +9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nSo, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times. So, the difference here is 50 - 49 = 1.\n\nWait, but let me check again. From 1-99, 4 in the tens place: pages 40-49, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. Similarly, 8 in the tens place: pages 80-89, which is 10 pages, so 10 times.\n\nFrom 100-399: each hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place, so 3\u00d710=30 for each digit.\n\nFrom 400-488: 4 in tens place: 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. 8 in tens place: 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times.\n\nSo, 4 in tens: 10 +30 +10=50\n\n8 in tens:10 +30 +9=49\n\nSo, the difference in the tens place is +1 for 4's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nThe hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers 100 and above. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, but since we're only considering page numbers printed once, and the first page is 1, I don't think the hundreds digit is printed as a 0. Wait, but in reality, page numbers don't include leading zeros, so page 1 is just '1', not '001'. Therefore, the hundreds digit only appears when the page number is 100 or more, and it's the first digit of the three-digit number.\n\nSo, let's consider the hundreds digit:\n\n- From 1-99: no hundreds digit, so 0 occurrences for all digits.\n- From 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so digit 1 appears 100 times (each page from 100 to 199).\n- From 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, appearing 100 times.\n- From 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, appearing 100 times.\n- From 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89 pages).\n\nSo, for the hundreds place:\n\n- Digit 4 appears 89 times (from 400-488).\n- Digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit only goes up to 4.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place:\n\n- Number of 4's: 89\n- Number of 8's: 0\n\nSo, the difference in the hundreds place is 89 - 0 = 89.\n\nNow, let's sum up the differences from each digit place.\n\nUnits place: 4's - 8's = 49 -49 = 0\n\nTens place: 50 -49 = +1\n\nHundreds place: 89 -0 = +89\n\nTotal difference: 0 +1 +89 = 90\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, the 4's appear 89 times, and 8's appear 0 times. So, that's a difference of 89.\n\nIn the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, 8's 49 times, so +1.\n\nUnits place: 49 each, so 0.\n\nTotal: 89 +1 =90.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those 89 pages. So, 89 times.\n\nAnd 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, yes, 89 difference there.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times, so that's a +1.\n\nUnits place: both 49 times, so no difference.\n\nSo, total difference is 89 +1 =90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place calculation again.\n\nFrom 1-99:\n\n- 4 in tens place: 40-49, which is 10 pages, so 10 times.\n- 8 in tens place:80-89, which is 10 pages, so 10 times.\n\nFrom 100-399:\n\nEach hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place, so 3\u00d710=30 for each.\n\nSo, 4 in tens: 30, 8 in tens:30.\n\nFrom 400-488:\n\n- 4 in tens: 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times.\n- 8 in tens:480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4 in tens:10 (1-99) +30 (100-399) +10 (400-488) =50\n\n8 in tens:10 +30 +9=49\n\nSo, yes, that's correct.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 4 in units:48 full sets (each contributing 1) +1 in 484, so 49\n- 8 in units:48 +1 in 488, so 49\n\nSo, units place difference:0\n\nTens place difference:1\n\nHundreds place difference:89\n\nTotal:90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be 90, but let me think again.\n\nWait, 488 is the last page, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4, as 488 is less than 500. So, the hundreds digit for 488 is 4, which is correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the hundreds place again. From 1-99, hundreds digit doesn't exist, so 0. From 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, 100 times. From 200-299: 2, 100 times. From 300-399:3, 100 times. From 400-488:4, 89 times.\n\nSo, for the hundreds digit, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 never appears. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the total number of 4's and 8's.\n\nTotal 4's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:50\n\nHundreds place:89\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:49\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:188 -98=90\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, and hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full sets (480 pages) and a partial set (pages 481-488).\n   - 4's: 48 (from full sets) + 1 (page 484) = 49\n   - 8's: 48 (from full sets) + 1 (page 488) = 49\n   - Difference: 49 - 49 = 0\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - From 1-99: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n   - From 100-399: 4 appears 30 times, 8 appears 30 times.\n   - From 400-488: 4 appears 10 times (440-449), 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 10 + 30 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 10 + 30 + 9 = 49\n   - Difference: 50 - 49 = 1\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - From 1-99: No hundreds digit.\n   - From 100-399: 1, 2, 3 each appear 100 times.\n   - From 400-488: 4 appears 89 times.\n   - 4's: 89\n   - 8's: 0\n   - Difference: 89 - 0 = 89\n\n**Total Difference:**\n- Units: 0\n- Tens: 1\n- Hundreds: 89\n- **Total:** 0 + 1 + 89 = 90\n\nThus, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page is printed once, starting from page 1 and ending at page 488. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the problem is asking. It's asking for the difference between the number of times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and the number of times the digit 8 appears. So, I need to count how many 4's are there in total and how many 8's, then subtract the two to find the difference.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to break it down into smaller parts. Maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's separately in each digit place\u2014units, tens, hundreds\u2014and then add them up. That should give me the total number of each digit.\n\nLet's start by considering the units place. For every 10 pages, the digits 0 through 9 appear once in the units place. So, from page 1 to page 10, the digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. Then from 11 to 20, it's 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0 again, and so on. \n\nSince the book has 488 pages, the units digit cycles every 10 pages. So, the number of times each digit appears in the units place is the number of complete groups of 10 pages, plus any extra pages beyond that. \n\nLet me calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488 pages. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete groups of 10 pages and 8 extra pages.\n\nIn each complete group of 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like page 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the digit 8 appears once as well (page 8, 18, 28, etc.). So, for the units place, each complete group contributes 1 four and 1 eight.\n\nTherefore, for 48 complete groups, the number of 4's in the units place is 48, and the number of 8's is also 48. Now, considering the remaining 8 pages (pages 481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these extra pages, the digit 4 appears once (page 484) and the digit 8 appears once (page 488). \n\nSo, in the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 + 1 = 49, and the total number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, interesting, so the units place contributes equally to both digits.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Since the last page is 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so in the last partial group, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So yes, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place of the partial group. So, units place: 49 fours and 49 eights.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit changes every 10 pages. For example, from page 1-9, the tens digit is 0, but since we start at page 1, maybe it's better to think in terms of two-digit numbers. From page 10-19, the tens digit is 1; 20-29, it's 2; and so on.\n\nTo find how many times 4 appears in the tens place, I need to find all the pages where the tens digit is 4. Similarly for 8.\n\nSo, let's think about the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. Wait, no, actually, for each hundred, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, in 100-199, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 for each set of ten pages, so each digit appears 10 times.\n\nBut since our book has 488 pages, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, let's find how many complete hundreds there are. 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages beyond that (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times (80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n\nSince there are 4 complete hundreds, the number of 4's in the tens place from the complete hundreds is 4 * 10 = 40. Similarly, the number of 8's is also 40.\n\nNow, let's consider the incomplete hundred, which is from 401 to 488. The tens digit here goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). Wait, actually, pages 401-488: the tens digit cycles as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nWait, but 488 is page 488, so the tens digit is 8, but the units digit is 8 as well. So, in the incomplete hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except the last one, which is only 8 pages (481-488). So, the tens digit 8 appears only 8 times, not 10.\n\nWait, no, let's think carefully. From 401-488, the tens digits go as follows:\n\n- 401-410: 10 pages, tens digit 0\n- 411-420: 10 pages, tens digit 1\n- 421-430: 10 pages, tens digit 2\n- 431-440: 10 pages, tens digit 3\n- 441-450: 10 pages, tens digit 4\n- 451-460: 10 pages, tens digit 5\n- 461-470: 10 pages, tens digit 6\n- 471-480: 10 pages, tens digit 7\n- 481-488: 8 pages, tens digit 8\n\nSo, in the incomplete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and the tens digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488). \n\nTherefore, in the tens place, the number of 4's in the incomplete hundred is 10, and the number of 8's is 8.\n\nSo, adding to the complete hundreds:\n\nTotal 4's in tens place = 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from incomplete hundred) = 50.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place = 40 (from complete hundreds) + 8 (from incomplete hundred) = 48.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, in the tens place, there are 50 fours and 48 eights.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit changes every 100 pages. From page 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0 (since it's a two-digit number), but since we're starting at page 1, maybe it's better to think that pages 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit, or the hundreds digit is 0. Then, from page 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. Let's see how many pages that is. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). \n\nSo, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times (once for each page from 400 to 488). The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the highest hundreds digit is 4 (since the book ends at 488). So, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours and 0 eights.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal fours = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate that. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal eights = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's are printed than 8's, subtract the total eights from the total fours: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n- Each group of 10 pages contributes 1 four and 1 eight.\n- 488 divided by 10 is 48 groups with a remainder of 8.\n- So, 48 fours and 48 eights from the groups, plus in the last 8 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once.\n- So, units: 48 + 1 = 49 fours, 48 + 1 = 49 eights.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each complete hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.) contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place.\n- There are 4 complete hundreds, so 4*10=40 fours and 40 eights.\n- In the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n- So, tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 fours, 40 + 8 = 48 eights.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 pages, so 89 fours.\n- Eights in hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal eights: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 91.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Units Place:**\n   - Each group of 10 pages (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete groups of 10 in 488 pages, contributing 48 fours and 48 eights.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) contribute one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - **Total in units place:** 49 fours and 49 eights.\n\n2. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Tens Place:**\n   - Each complete hundred (e.g., 1-100) contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place.\n   - There are 4 complete hundreds, contributing 40 fours and 40 eights.\n   - The incomplete hundred (401-488) contributes 10 fours (441-450) and 8 eights (481-488).\n   - **Total in tens place:** 50 fours and 48 eights.\n\n3. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 contribute 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n   - There are no eights in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 89 fours and 0 eights.\n\n4. **Summing Up:**\n   - **Total fours:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **Total eights:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n5. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - 188 fours - 97 eights = 91 more fours.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{91}."

    "text": " Each page is printed once, starting from 1 and ending at 488. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears, then find the difference between these two counts.\n\nFirst, I think I should break down the problem by considering each digit place separately: the units place and the tens place. Maybe even the hundreds place, though since the book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit won't go beyond 4. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nStarting with the units place: I need to count how many times 4 appears in the units digit from 1 to 488. Similarly, I need to count how many times 8 appears in the units digit.\n\nFor the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So in every block of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 will appear exactly once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. So for each 10 numbers, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n\nNow, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then an additional 8 numbers (481-488). So in the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 times 1 (for each block) plus any extra in the last partial block. Looking at the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So here, the digit 4 appears once and 8 appears once. Therefore, total 4's in units place are 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's are also 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so the last page is 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So maybe I should check that again. Let's see: from 1 to 480, there are 48 blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8. So 48 each. Then from 481 to 488, that's 8 numbers: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So in this last partial block, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So yes, units place: 48 +1 =49 for 4's, and 48 +1=49 for 8's. So units place contributes equally, 49 each.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. Here, the digits cycle every 100 numbers. In the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in every block of 100. So for example, in 1-100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place for 80-89, also 10 times.\n\nBut wait, in our case, the book has 488 pages, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4, and the tens and units digits go up to 88. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. From 1-488, the hundreds digit is 1 for 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, and 4 for 300-488. But since we're only concerned with the digits 4 and 8, the hundreds digit contributes to 4's in the hundreds place. Specifically, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. So how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? That's from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So that's 89 times 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, back to the tens place. Let's consider how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place from 1 to 488.\n\nFor the tens digit, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each hundred. So in 1-100, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and 8 appears 10 times (80-89). Similarly, in 101-200, the tens digit cycles again, so another 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place. The same applies to 201-300 and 301-400. But from 401-488, the hundreds digit is 4, but the tens digit still cycles through 0-9. Let me think carefully.\n\nWait, actually, from 1-400, there are four hundreds: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400. Wait, 400 is the start of the next hundred, but since we're only going up to 488, let's see.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place from 1 to 488.\n\nEach hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place. So from 1-400, there are four hundreds, each contributing 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place. So that's 4 * 10 = 40 times for 4 and 40 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nBut wait, 400 is part of the 400-488 range. So from 400-488, how does that affect the tens digit?\n\nWait, from 400-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So in the tens place, each digit from 0-8 appears 10 times, except for the last partial hundred.\n\nWait, actually, from 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but each digit appears 10 times except for the last one, which is 8, but since we stop at 488, the tens digit 8 appears only 9 times (from 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.\n\nWait, from 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Each full set of 10 in the tens place contributes 10 numbers. So:\n\n- 400-409: tens digit 0\n- 410-419: tens digit 1\n- 420-429: tens digit 2\n- 430-439: tens digit 3\n- 440-449: tens digit 4\n- 450-459: tens digit 5\n- 460-469: tens digit 6\n- 470-479: tens digit 7\n- 480-488: tens digit 8\n\nSo in this range, each tens digit from 0-7 appears exactly 10 times, and the tens digit 8 appears 9 times (from 480-488, which is 9 numbers). So in the tens place from 400-488, the digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and the digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place, from 1-488:\n\n- For 4: 4 hundreds (1-400) each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40, plus in 400-488, another 10 times, so total 40 +10=50 times for 4 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but wait, that can't be right because from 1-400, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times in each hundred, so 4 hundreds would give 40 times. But from 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears another 10 times (440-449). So total for 4 in the tens place is 40 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place: from 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 times, so 4*10=40 times. From 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So total for 8 in the tens place is 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 times 8 in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then from 400-488, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So total 40+9=49 for 8 in the tens place.\n\nSo in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that from 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), which is correct. So total 50 for 4 in tens place.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. As I thought earlier, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 numbers (488 -400 +1=89). So the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4, not 8.\n\nWait, but 888 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but since the book is only 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit.\n\nFor digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 +50 +89 = 188\n\nFor digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 +49 +0 = 98\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Wait, in the units place, I had 49 for both 4 and 8. In the tens place, 50 for 4 and 49 for 8. Hundreds place: 89 for 4 and 0 for 8.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98 =90.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, in the tens place, from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear? Let me recount.\n\nEach hundred contributes 10 times for 4 in the tens place. So from 1-100: 40-49, 10 times. 101-200: 140-149, 10 times. 201-300: 240-249, 10 times. 301-400: 340-349, 10 times. Then from 401-488: 440-449, 10 times. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 times. So yes, 50 times for 4 in the tens place.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place: same as above, each hundred contributes 10 times, so from 1-400: 4 sets of 10, so 40 times. From 401-488: 480-488, which is 9 times. So 40 +9=49.\n\nUnits place: 49 for both, as each 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8, with the last partial block contributing one each.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 +50 +89=188\n\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me just think again: 488 pages. So when I count the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, so that's correct. And the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times, so that's correct.\n\nIn the units place, from 1-488, every 10 numbers contribute one 4 and one 8. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens and 8 extra. In the 48 full tens, 48 times 1 for 4 and 48 times 1 for 8. Then in the last 8 numbers (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So total 49 each, correct.\n\nSo yes, 4's total 188, 8's total 98, difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 4's. Correct.\n\nIs there any other place where 4 or 8 could appear? No, just units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nSo I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Count 4's and 8's in the Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n   - Total blocks of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full blocks (1-480) and a partial block (481-488).\n   - Each full block contributes 1 of each digit, so 48 each.\n   - The partial block (481-488) contributes 1 each.\n   - **Total Units Place:**\n     - 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n     - 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Count 4's and 8's in the Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 of each digit in the tens place.\n   - From 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 of each digit.\n     - 4's: 4 * 10 = 40\n     - 8's: 4 * 10 = 40\n   - From 401-488:\n     - 4's: 10 times (440-449)\n     - 8's: 9 times (480-488)\n   - **Total Tens Place:**\n     - 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n     - 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Count 4's and 8's in the Hundreds Place:**\n   - From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, contributing 89 times (488 - 400 + 1).\n   - 8's never appear in the hundreds place within 488.\n   - **Total Hundreds Place:**\n     - 4's: 89\n     - 8's: 0\n\n4. **Summing Up:**\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " I'm going to try to break this down step by step, even though I'm not very experienced with these kinds of problems.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the problem is asking. It says that each page is numbered from 1 to 488, and I have to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find how many more 4's there are.\n\nOkay, so the main idea is to count the occurrences of each digit (4 and 8) in each position of the page numbers. Since page numbers can be one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit numbers, I should consider each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each block of 10 numbers. For example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit appears once in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in a block of 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (40-49), and the same goes for the digit 8.\n\nNow, let's think about the hundreds place. Since the book has 488 pages, the hundreds digit will be 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 times (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place here because the hundreds digit only goes up to 4.\n\nWait, but I'm only considering the hundreds place for 4 and 8. Since the maximum hundreds digit is 4, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 occurrences of 4 and 0 occurrences of 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens digit across all page numbers.\n\nFor the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in each block of 100. So, in the first 100 pages (1-100), the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (40-49), and the same for 8 (80-89). So, each of these digits appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 pages.\n\nNow, how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? There are four complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, that's actually four complete hundreds (each 100 pages) plus an additional 88 pages (401-488). So, in each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 and 8 each appear 10 times. So, for each of the four hundreds, that's 4 times 10 for 4's and 4 times 10 for 8's, so 40 each from the tens place in the complete hundreds.\n\nBut wait, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is 4 8 8). So, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place in this partial hundred?\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, for the tens digit 4, it appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. Similarly, for 8, it appears in 480-488, which is 9 times because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, so that's 9 times. Wait, but 480 is included, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 = 8, but including both endpoints, it's 9. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the last partial hundred.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, for 480-488, the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 times. Similarly, for the 4's in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 times.\n\nSo, in the last partial hundred, the tens digit contributes 10 more 4's and 9 more 8's.\n\nTherefore, the total for the tens place across all page numbers would be:\n\nFor 4's: 4 hundreds * 10 (from each hundred) + 10 (from the partial hundred) = 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nFor 8's: 4 hundreds * 10 (from each hundred) + 9 (from the partial hundred) = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Each complete hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would be 4*10=40 for 4's and 4*10=40 for 8's. Then, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, for 4's in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. For 8's, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, total for tens place:\n\n4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n\n8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me think again. From 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles through 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit, the count is 10 times except for the last one, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, 4's occur once in the 440s, which is 10 times, and 8's occur once in the 480s, which is 9 times. So, yes, 50 for 4's and 49 for 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place. For each digit, 0-9, each digit appears exactly once every 10 numbers. So, in the units place, the number of times a digit appears is total pages divided by 10, rounded down, plus any extra in the last partial set.\n\nBut let me think more carefully. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in each position. So, in the entire range from 1 to 488, how many times does each digit appear in the units place?\n\nWell, the total number of units digits is 488. Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles of 10, each contributing one occurrence of each digit. But wait, 48*10=480, so from 1 to 480, each digit appears 48 times in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1 through 8, so each digit from 1 to 8 appears once more. So, digits 1-8 appear 48 + 1 = 49 times, and digits 9 and 0 appear 48 times.\n\nWait, but that's only if we're considering 488 as the last page. So, in the units place, digit 4 appears 48 times from 1-480, and then once more in 484, so total 49 times. Similarly, digit 8 appears 48 times from 1-480, and then once more in 488, so 49 times as well.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so from 481-488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, digits 1 through 8 each appear once more, and 9 and 0 don't appear in the units place in this last partial set. So, for digits 1-8, they each have 48 + 1 = 49 occurrences in the units place, and 9 and 0 have 48 each.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 1 to 480, each digit 0-9 appears exactly 48 times in the units place because 480 / 10 = 48. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so each of those digits appears once more, making their total 49. So, yes, digits 1-8 appear 49 times, and 9 and 0 appear 48 times in the units place.\n\nTherefore, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 49 times, and the digit 8 appears 49 times as well.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. For example, from 1 to 480, digit 4 appears in the units place 48 times, and then in 484, which is within 481-488, so that's one more occurrence, making it 49. Similarly, digit 8 appears 48 times from 1-480, and then in 488, which is another occurrence, making it 49. So, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place.\n\nNow, let me summarize the counts so far:\n\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 4's: 89 times (from 400-488)\n  - 8's: 0 times\n\n- Tens place:\n  - 4's: 50 times\n  - 8's: 49 times\n\n- Units place:\n  - 4's: 49 times\n  - 8's: 49 times\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's there. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, so again, no 4's or 8's. Similarly, 200-299: hundreds digit 2; 300-399: hundreds digit 3. Then, 400-488: hundreds digit 4. So, in the hundreds place, only 4's appear, and they appear from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that?\n\n488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences of 4's in the hundreds place. And since 8's can't appear in the hundreds place because the maximum is 488, so 0 occurrences.\n\nSo, now, adding up all the occurrences:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Hundreds place: 89\n- Tens place: 50\n- Units place: 49\nTotal 4's = 89 + 50 + 49 = let's see: 89 + 50 = 139; 139 + 49 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Hundreds place: 0\n- Tens place: 49\n- Units place: 49\nTotal 8's = 0 + 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off because 188 - 98 = 90, but I thought the difference might be smaller. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the tens place counts. Let me go through each digit place again carefully.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n- 8's: 0 times.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for each of the four complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly for 8 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n\nSo, for the first four hundreds, 4's in tens place: 4 * 10 = 40\n\nSimilarly, 8's in tens place: 4 * 10 = 40\n\nNow, the last partial hundred is 401-488. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear?\n\nEach tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which might be cut short. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in this partial hundred.\n\nSimilarly, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nSo, in the last partial hundred:\n\n- 4's in tens place: 10\n- 8's in tens place: 9\n\nTherefore, total for tens place:\n\n- 4's: 40 (from four complete hundreds) + 10 (partial) = 50\n- 8's: 40 (from four complete hundreds) + 9 (partial) = 49\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNow, units place:\n\nEach digit from 0-9 appears equally in the units place. From 1-480, each digit appears 48 times in the units place. Then, from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so each of these digits appears once more, making their total 49 times. So, 4 and 8 each appear 49 times in the units place.\n\nSo, units place:\n\n- 4's: 49\n- 8's: 49\n\nNow, adding up all occurrences:\n\n4's:\n- Hundreds: 89\n- Tens: 50\n- Units: 49\nTotal: 89 + 50 = 139; 139 + 49 = 188\n\n8's:\n- Hundreds: 0\n- Tens: 49\n- Units: 49\nTotal: 0 + 49 = 49; 49 + 49 = 98\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe the difference was 90, but I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the counts.\n\nWait, let me check the units place again. From 1-480, each digit appears 48 times in the units place, correct? Because 480 / 10 = 48. Then, from 481-488, units digits are 1-8, each appearing once. So, 4 and 8 each get one more, making it 49 times. So, that's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, the last partial hundred contributes 10 for 4's and 9 for 8's, which adds to 50 and 49 respectively. So, that's correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times, and 8's don't appear at all. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's: 89 + 50 + 49 = 188\n\n8's: 0 + 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, but I just realized something. When counting the hundreds place, I assumed that every number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, which is correct. So, that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 4's.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure that 488 - 400 + 1 is indeed 89. 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89, so that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: from 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers? It's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the tens place again. From 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit, how many numbers have that digit in the tens place?\n\nFor example, tens digit 0: 401-410, which is 10 numbers.\n\nTens digit 1: 411-420, 10 numbers.\n\nSimilarly up to tens digit 8: 481-488, which is 8 numbers? Wait, no, 481-488 is 8 numbers, but wait, 481 to 488 is 8 numbers, right? 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 8 numbers, not 9.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 9 numbers because 488 - 480 = 8, but including both endpoints, it's 9 numbers. Wait, but 480 is part of the previous set, right? Wait, no, 480 is included in 401-488, because 480 is less than 488.\n\nWait, no, 480 is within 401-488, so when we're considering the tens digit 8 in the last partial hundred, it's from 480-488. So, 480 is included, so that's 480,481,...,488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the last partial hundred.\n\nWait, but 480 is part of 401-488, so yes, it's included. So, that's correct, 9 times.\n\nSo, in the last partial hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times, and 4 appears 10 times.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the count for 480-488. 480 is the first number, and 488 is the last. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times, and 4 appears 10 times in the last partial hundred.\n\nSo, the counts are correct.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought maybe the difference was 90, but let me just make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is to calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a systematic approach to count the digits.\n\nLet me try to formalize the counting process.\n\nFor each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), count the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nTotal numbers: 488.\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears equally in the units place, except possibly the last partial set.\n\nNumber of complete sets of 10: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets).\n\nEach complete set contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 each.\n\nThen, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once more.\n\nSo, total units place:\n\n4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n\nNumber of complete hundreds: 4 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400).\n\nEach contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 40 each.\n\nThen, the last partial hundred (401-488) has tens digits from 0 to 8.\n\nIn this partial hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (440-449), and 8 appears in the tens place for 9 numbers (480-488).\n\nSo, total tens place:\n\n4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n\n8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly 4's appear in the hundreds place, from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nSo, hundreds place:\n\n4's: 89\n\n8's: 0\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nSo, the answer should be 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. I'm pretty confident in this approach, but just to make sure, maybe I can test it on a smaller number of pages to see if the method works.\n\nFor example, suppose the book has 28 pages. Let's count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nPage numbers: 1-28.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\nUnits place: 4,14,24 \u2192 3 times.\n\nTens place: 40-49, but since we only go up to 28, the tens digit 4 doesn't appear. So, 0 times.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 4's: 3.\n\nCounting 8's:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,28 \u2192 3 times.\n\nTens place: 80-89, but we only go up to 28, so 0 times.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 3.\n\nDifference: 3 - 3 = 0.\n\nWait, but according to our method:\n\nUnits place:\n\nTotal pages: 28.\n\nNumber of complete sets of 10: 2 (1-10, 11-20).\n\nEach contributes 1 occurrence of 4 and 8 in units place: 2 each.\n\nRemaining pages: 21-28, units digits 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once more.\n\nTotal units place:\n\n4's: 2 + 1 = 3\n\n8's: 2 + 1 = 3\n\nTens place:\n\nEach complete hundred (but 28 is less than 100, so only 1-28). The tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, which is beyond 28, so 0 times.\n\nSimilarly, tens digit 8 appears 0 times.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 3; 8's: 3. Difference 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: 48 pages.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\nUnits place: 4,14,24,34,44 \u2192 5 times.\n\nTens place: 40-49 \u2192 10 times (but 48 is the last page, so 40-48: 9 times.\n\nWait, no, in 48 pages, the tens digit 4 appears from 40-48, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nWait, but according to our method:\n\nUnits place:\n\nTotal pages: 48.\n\nComplete sets of 10: 4 (1-10, 11-20, 21-30, 31-40).\n\nEach contributes 1 occurrence of 4 and 8 in units place: 4 each.\n\nRemaining pages: 41-48, units digits 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once more.\n\nTotal units place:\n\n4's: 4 + 1 = 5\n\n8's: 4 + 1 = 5\n\nTens place:\n\nEach complete hundred: 0, since 48 < 100.\n\nBut in the tens place, from 1-48, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-48, which is 9 times.\n\nSimilarly, tens digit 8 appears in 80-88, but since we only go up to 48, it doesn't appear.\n\nWait, but according to our method, in the tens place:\n\nEach complete hundred contributes 10 times each digit, but since we have less than a hundred, we need to check.\n\nWait, in the method above, for the tens place, we considered each complete hundred contributing 10 times each digit. But in the case of 48 pages, there are no complete hundreds beyond 1-48, so the tens digit 4 appears in 40-48, which is 9 times, and 8 doesn't appear in the tens place.\n\nSo, according to our method, for the tens place:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds: 0, since 48 < 100.\n\nSo, 4's in tens place: 0 + 9 = 9\n\n8's in tens place: 0 + 0 = 0\n\nSo, total 4's: 5 (units) + 9 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 14\n\nTotal 8's: 5 (units) + 0 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 5\n\nDifference: 14 - 5 = 9\n\nWait, but let's count manually:\n\nPage numbers from 1 to 48.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\nUnits place: 4,14,24,34,44 \u2192 5\n\nTens place: 40-48 \u2192 9 (40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48)\n\nHundreds place: 0\n\nTotal 4's: 5 + 9 = 14\n\nCounting 8's:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,28,38,48 \u2192 5\n\nTens place: 80-88, but since we only go up to 48, 0\n\nHundreds place: 0\n\nTotal 8's: 5\n\nDifference: 14 - 5 = 9\n\nWhich matches our method. So, the method works.\n\nTherefore, returning to the original problem, the difference is 90.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we need to count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n### Units Place\n- Each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in the units place.\n- From 1 to 480, each digit appears 48 times.\n- From 481 to 488, the units digits are 1 through 8, each appearing once more.\n- Therefore, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place.\n\n### Tens Place\n- Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in each block of 100 numbers.\n- For the first four hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each digit appears 10 times in the tens place, contributing 40 times each for 4 and 8.\n- In the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and the tens digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n- Therefore, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times in the tens place.\n\n### Hundreds Place\n- The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n- 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n- Therefore, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\n### Total Counts\n- **4's:**\n  - Units place: 49\n  - Tens place: 50\n  - Hundreds place: 89\n  - Total: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n- **8's:**\n  - Units place: 49\n  - Tens place: 49\n  - Hundreds place: 0\n  - Total: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\n### Difference\n- The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{90}\n\\]"

    "text": " Each page is printed once, starting from 1 and ending at 488. I need to find out how many times the digit 4 appears and how many times the digit 8 appears, then subtract the two to find the difference.\n\nFirst, I think I should approach this by considering each digit place separately: the units place and the tens place. Maybe even the hundreds place, since 488 is a three-digit number. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nStarting with the units place: I know that every 10 pages, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, for example, pages 1-10 have 1 each of digits 0-9 in the units place, except page 1 which is 1, page 2 which is 2, and so on up to page 10, which is 0. So, in each block of 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same for 8.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, every 100 pages, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, pages 1-100 have the digit 4 in the tens place for pages 40-49, which is 10 times, and similarly for 8 in pages 80-89.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: Since the book has 488 pages, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, actually, page numbers start at 1, so the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nBut wait, for the digit 8 in the hundreds place, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, the count for 8 in the hundreds place is zero.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of times 4 appears in the units and tens places.\n\nFirst, units place:\n- Each 10 pages, 4 appears once.\n- Total number of pages is 488, so number of complete 10s is 48 (since 48*10=480). But wait, 488 is 480 + 8, so there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra pages.\n- So, in each of the 48 complete sets, 4 appears once, so 48 times.\n- Now, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once here as well.\n- So total 4s in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check that. Alternatively, the number of 4s in the units place can be calculated as the number of times 4 appears in the units digit from 1 to 488. Since every 10 pages, it's once, so total number is floor(488/10) = 48 times, plus 1 if the last page is 488, which it is, but 488's units digit is 8, so no. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, and since 488 is beyond 480, we check if 488 has a units digit of 4, which it doesn't, so units place 4s are 48.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought in the last 8 pages, 481-488, the units digit 4 appears once. But 481 has units digit 1, 482 is 2, 483 is 3, 484 is 4, so yes, 484 is within 481-488, so that's an extra 4. So total units place 4s would be 48 (from 1-480) plus 1 (from 484), totaling 49.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The number of times a digit appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10, which is 488 // 10 = 48, plus 1 if the units digit is >=4. But wait, no, that's not correct. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is exactly floor(488/10) times, which is 48, because each 10 pages contribute one 4. But in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 4 appears once more at 484. So total is 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8s in the units place, it's the same logic. Each 10 pages, 8 appears once, so 48 times, and in the last 8 pages, 488 is the last page, which is 8, so that's an extra 8. So total units place 8s: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so in the last 8 pages, 488 is included, so units digit 8 appears once. So units place 8s: 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, but I think that's correct. So both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages. So, for example, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times in each block of 100 pages, specifically in pages 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so in the last block, 440-449 is within 488, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so we have to check if 440-449 is entirely within 488.\n\nSince 449 is less than 488, yes, so 440-449 is fully included. So how many complete hundreds do we have? From 1-488, we have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488.\n\nWait, actually, each hundred block contributes 10 4s in the tens place. So:\n\n- 1-100: 40-49 \u2192 10 4s\n- 101-200: 140-149 \u2192 10 4s\n- 201-300: 240-249 \u2192 10 4s\n- 301-400: 340-349 \u2192 10 4s\n- 401-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 4s\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10 4s. So total 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 4s in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 401-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 pages, so yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, for the 8s in the tens place, similar logic. Each block of 100 pages has 10 8s in the tens place, from 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n\nSo:\n\n- 1-100: 80-89 \u2192 10 8s\n- 101-200: 180-189 \u2192 10 8s\n- 201-300: 280-289 \u2192 10 8s\n- 301-400: 380-389 \u2192 10 8s\n- 401-488: 480-489 \u2192 but wait, our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? From 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 pages. So in the 401-488 block, 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9 8s in the tens place.\n\nSo total 8s in the tens place: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 in the last partial block, totaling 49.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me check again. From 1-400, each 100 pages has 10 8s in the tens place, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 pages. So total 40 + 9 = 49 8s in the tens place.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nAs I thought earlier, the hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. So, how many pages is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nFor the digit 8 in the hundreds place, since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears zero times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4s: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me check that addition again: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nTotal 8s: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4s is 188, and the number of 8s is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4s and 8s in the units and tens places.\n\nWait, for units place:\n\n4s: 48 (from 1-480) +1 (484) = 49.\n\n8s: 48 (from 1-480) +1 (488) = 49.\n\nTens place:\n\n4s: 5 blocks \u00d710 = 50.\n\n8s: 4 blocks \u00d710 = 40, plus 9 in 480-488, total 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4s: 89.\n\n8s: 0.\n\nSo, 4s total: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n8s total: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4s than 8s.\n\nBut let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for 4s. From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\n- 40-49: 10\n- 140-149: 10\n- 240-249: 10\n- 340-349: 10\n- 440-449: 10\n\nThat's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8s in the tens place:\n\n- 80-89:10\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nSo that's 4\u00d710 +9=49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnd in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4s: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8s:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4s than 8s.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears and how many times the digit 8 appears, then subtract the two to find the difference.\n\nFirst, I should break down the problem by looking at each digit place separately: the units place and the tens place. Sometimes, the hundreds place might come into play if the number is three digits, but since the book only has 488 pages, the highest page number is 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But wait, in this case, the hundreds digit for all page numbers from 1 to 488 will be 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. However, since we're only dealing with page numbers up to 488, the hundreds digit will be 4 from 400 to 488.\n\nBut wait, I'm being asked about the digits 4 and 8. So, I need to count how many times each digit appears in the units and tens places, and maybe even the hundreds place if applicable. Let me start by considering the units place first.\n\nFor the units place:\n- The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. For example, in 1-10, it's at 4; 11-20, it's at 14; and so on.\n- Similarly, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, etc.\n\nSo, to find the total number of 4's in the units place, I can divide the total number of pages by 10 and take the integer part, then multiply by 1 (since each 10 numbers contribute one 4). But wait, that might not be entirely accurate because the last set of 10 numbers might not be complete. Let me think.\n\nActually, for the units digit, the number of times a digit appears is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in the total number of pages. So, for 488 pages, the number of complete groups of 10 is 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8). So, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times in the units place, except possibly the last partial group.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page. So, the units digit goes up to 8 in the last group. So, in the units place, the digit 8 appears once more in 488, so maybe I need to adjust for that.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to calculate it as the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete tens, which is 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8), so 48 times. Similarly, 8 appears 48 times in the units place as well, except in the last partial group, which is 480-488. In that group, the units digits go from 0 to 8, so 8 appears once more. So, maybe 8 appears 49 times in the units place.\n\nWait, but let me check this more carefully. Let's consider each digit's occurrence in the units place:\n\n- For 4: The number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of times the units digit is 4. Since every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nWell, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. Additionally, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 4 doesn't appear again. So, total 4's in units place: 48.\n\nSimilarly, for 8: The number of times 8 appears in the units place is also 48 times from the complete groups, plus one more in the last group (488), so 49 times.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so in the units place, 8 appears once more, making it 49 times. So, units place: 4 appears 48 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place:\n\nIn the tens place, the digit 4 appears in numbers from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 times the digit 4 in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me think. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times in each hundred. So, for 488 pages, how many hundreds are there?\n\nWell, 488 pages mean we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. Wait, actually, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So, let's break it down:\n\n- From 1-100: The tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 times.\n- From 101-200: The tens digit is 4 in 140-149, another 10 times.\n- From 201-300: The tens digit is 4 in 240-249, another 10 times.\n- From 301-400: The tens digit is 4 in 340-349, another 10 times.\n- From 401-488: The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 times, but wait, 449 is within 488, so that's 10 times.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, total number of times 4 appears in the tens place is 5 sets of 10, so 50 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: 1-100: 40-49 \u2192 10 times\n101-200: 140-149 \u2192 10 times\n201-300: 240-249 \u2192 10 times\n301-400: 340-349 \u2192 10 times\n401-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 times\nSo, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 times, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place:\n\n- From 1-100: 80-89 \u2192 10 times\n- 101-200: 180-189 \u2192 10 times\n- 201-300: 280-289 \u2192 10 times\n- 301-400: 380-389 \u2192 10 times\n- 401-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 times (since 488 is the last page, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, the tens digit is 8 for all these, so 9 times.\n\nWait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in the last hundred.\n\nSo, total number of times 8 appears in the tens place is 4 \u00d7 10 (from the first four hundreds) + 9 (from the last partial hundred) = 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1-100, 80-89: 10 times\n101-200: 180-189: 10 times\n201-300: 280-289: 10 times\n301-400: 380-389: 10 times\n401-488: 480-488: 9 times (since 488 is the last page)\nSo, 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nIn the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears in all page numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nThe digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the highest page number is 488, so the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. It never reaches 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, now, let's sum up the occurrences for each digit.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 48 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 times.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, let me go through each step again.\n\nUnits place:\n- 4 appears once every 10 numbers, so 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 times. Correct.\n- 8 appears once every 10 numbers, and in the last group, 488 adds an extra 8, so 49 times. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n- 4 appears in each hundred's 40-49, 140-149, etc., which is 5 sets of 10, so 50 times. Correct.\n- 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, etc., which is 4 sets of 10, and then in 480-488, which is 9 times, so 4\u00d710 +9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times. Correct.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's is 89 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me recount.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 page numbers.\n\nAnother way to think about it: for each digit place, units, tens, hundreds, we count how many times each digit appears.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a formula or a more systematic approach.\n\nFor units digit:\nNumber of 4's = floor(488 / 10) = 48\nNumber of 8's = floor(488 / 10) + (if the units digit of 488 is >=8, then 1 else 0). Since 488's units digit is 8, which is equal to 8, so number of 8's is 48 +1=49.\n\nFor tens digit:\nNumber of 4's = floor(488 / 100) * 10 + extra in the last partial hundred.\n\nWait, actually, for the tens digit, the number of times a digit d appears in the tens place up to N is calculated as:\n\ncount = (N // 100) * 10\nremainder = N % 100\nif remainder >= 20:\n    count += min(remainder - 10 + 1, 10)\nelse:\n    count += 0\n\nWait, perhaps that's a more accurate way.\n\nWait, for the tens digit, the number of times digit d appears is:\n\nFor each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9. So, for each hundred, digit d appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nBut when we have a partial hundred, say from 400 to 488, the tens digit can go up to 8 in the tens place (since 488 is the last number). So, for digit 4 in the tens place in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, for digit 8 in the tens place, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo, for digit 4 in the tens place:\n- Complete hundreds: 4 (since 488 is in the 4th hundred, but wait, 488 is in the 400-488 range, which is part of the 4th hundred? Wait, 1-100 is first, 101-200 second, 201-300 third, 301-400 fourth, and 401-488 is the fifth partial hundred. Wait, so actually, 400 is the start of the fifth hundred? No, wait, 301-400 is the fourth hundred, and 401-500 would be the fifth, but we only go up to 488. So, in terms of hundreds, the first four hundreds are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Then, 401-488 is part of the fifth hundred, but only up to 488.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of how many full hundreds we have. So, 488 is less than 500, so we have four full hundreds (1-400) and then 401-488, which is 88 pages.\n\nSo, for digit 4 in the tens place:\n- In each full hundred (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10 times. So, 4 full hundreds \u00d710 = 40 times.\n- In the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 times.\nSo, total 40 +10=50 times. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8 in the tens place:\n- In each full hundred, 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contributing 10 times. So, 4 \u00d710=40 times.\n- In the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 times (since 488 is included).\nSo, total 40 +9=49 times.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n- Digit 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 times.\n- Digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: 48 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 187\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98\nDifference:187 -98=89\n\nWait, so the answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me think again to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, another approach: For each digit place, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n- For 488 pages, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place is equal to the number of times d appears in each 10-number block, times the number of such blocks, plus any extra in the last partial block.\n\nSo, for 4 in units place:\nNumber of complete blocks: floor(488 /10)=48\nEach block contributes 1 occurrence of 4 in the units place.\nSo, 48 \u00d71=48\nIn the last partial block (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 doesn't appear again. So, total 48.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in units place:\nNumber of complete blocks:48\nEach contributes 1 occurrence of 8.\nSo, 48 \u00d71=48\nIn the last partial block, units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once more. So, total 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place:\nFor 4 in tens place:\nEach hundred contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.)\nNumber of complete hundreds: floor(488 /100)=4 (since 4\u00d7100=400)\nEach contributes 10 occurrences, so 4\u00d710=40\nIn the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\nTotal 40 +10=50.\n\nFor 8 in tens place:\nEach hundred contributes 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place (80-89, 180-189, etc.)\nNumber of complete hundreds:4\nEach contributes 10, so 4\u00d710=40\nIn the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences.\nTotal 40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\nFor 4:\nThe hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 488 -400 +1=89 numbers.\nSo, 89 occurrences.\n\nFor 8:\nThe hundreds digit is 8 only from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nNow, summing up:\nTotal 4's:48 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=187\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98\nDifference:187 -98=89\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the number of 4's printed is 89 more than the number of 8's.\n\nI think I've double-checked all the steps, so I'm confident that the answer is 89.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, and hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- **4's:** Occur once every 10 numbers. With 488 pages, there are 48 complete groups of 10, so 48 occurrences.\n- **8's:** Similarly, occur 48 times, plus one more in the last group (488), totaling 49.\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- **4's:** Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences (e.g., 40-49). Four complete hundreds contribute 40, plus 10 in 440-449, totaling 50.\n- **8's:** Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences (e.g., 80-89). Four complete hundreds contribute 40, plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- **4's:** Appears 89 times from 400-488.\n- **8's:** Never appears.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 187 - 98 = 89\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by **89**.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by understanding the problem better. Each page from 1 to 488 has its number printed once. I need to count how many times the digit '4' appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit '8' appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to break it down by the number of digits in the page numbers. Pages 1 through 9 are single-digit, pages 10 through 99 are two-digit, pages 100 through 488 are three-digit. Wait, actually, 488 is a three-digit number, so that's correct.\n\nI should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. For each place, I can calculate how many times '4' and '8' appear.\n\nStarting with single-digit pages (1-9):\n\n- For 4: The digit '4' appears once (page 4).\n- For 8: The digit '8' appears once (page 8).\n\nSo, in single-digit pages, 4's and 8's each appear once. The difference here is zero.\n\nMoving on to two-digit pages (10-99):\n\nI can think of each two-digit number as having a tens place and a units place. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each place separately.\n\nFirst, the tens place:\n\n- For 4 in the tens place: The numbers are 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so '4' appears 10 times in the tens place.\n- For 8 in the tens place: The numbers are 80-89. That's another 10 numbers, so '8' appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the units place:\n\n- For 4 in the units place: In every set of ten numbers (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit '4' appears once in the units place. There are 9 such sets (10-99), so 9 times. But wait, actually, from 10 to 99, there are 9 decades (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99). So, '4' appears 9 times in the units place.\n- Similarly, '8' appears 9 times in the units place.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 10 to 99, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 in each decade. So, for each digit (0-9), each digit appears once in the units place per decade. There are 9 decades (since 10-99 is 90 numbers, which is 9 sets of 10). So, '4' appears 9 times in the units place, same as '8'.\n\nSo, in two-digit numbers:\n\n- '4's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n- '8's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n\nAgain, the difference is zero so far.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit pages (100-488):\n\nThis is a bit more involved. Each three-digit number has hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place:\n\n- The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nBut wait, 400-488 is a partial hundred. So, I need to be careful here.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n1. Hundreds place is 1: 100-199\n2. Hundreds place is 2: 200-299\n3. Hundreds place is 3: 300-399\n4. Hundreds place is 4: 400-488\n\nNow, let's calculate '4's and '8's in each place.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place:\n\n- For '4' in hundreds place: Only in 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But actually, in terms of the hundreds digit, it's 100 numbers if it were 400-499, but since it's only up to 488, the hundreds digit is '4' for 89 numbers. So, '4' appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\n- For '8' in hundreds place: Well, in the range 100-488, the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, '8' never appears in the hundreds place here. So, '8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nNow, tens place:\n\nWe need to calculate how many times '4' and '8' appear in the tens place across all three-digit numbers from 100-488.\n\nLet's think about each hundred group separately.\n\n1. 100-199:\n   - Tens digit cycles from 0-9 for each hundred. So, in the tens place, '4' appears 10 times (140-149) and '8' appears 10 times (180-189).\n   \n2. 200-299:\n   - Similarly, '4' appears 10 times (240-249) and '8' appears 10 times (280-289).\n   \n3. 300-399:\n   - '4' appears 10 times (340-349) and '8' appears 10 times (380-389).\n   \n4. 400-488:\n   - Here, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for '4' in the tens place: 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so '4' appears 10 times.\n   - For '8' in the tens place: 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, '8' appears 9 times in the tens place here.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. From 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit, the units digit can be 0-9, except when the tens digit is 8, where the units digit only goes up to 8.\n\nSo, in the tens place:\n\n- For '4' in tens place: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 '4's.\n- For '8' in tens place: 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 '8's.\n\nSo, adding up across all hundreds:\n\n- '4's in tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40\n- '8's in tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39\n\nWait, so '4's have 40 and '8's have 39 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers:\n\nAgain, let's consider each hundred group.\n\n1. 100-199:\n   - For each ten's group (like 100-109, 110-119, etc.), the units digit cycles 0-9. So, in each ten's group, '4' appears once in the units place, and '8' appears once.\n   - There are 10 ten's groups, so '4's: 10, '8's:10.\n   \n2. 200-299:\n   - Same as above, '4's:10, '8's:10.\n   \n3. 300-399:\n   - Same, '4's:10, '8's:10.\n   \n4. 400-488:\n   - Here, the units digit goes from 0 to 9 for each ten's group, except for the last one which is 480-488, where units go up to 8.\n   - So, for '4's in units place: In each ten's group, '4' appears once. How many ten's groups are there? From 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, 9 ten's groups.\n   - But wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is 9 ten's groups (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488). So, in each of the first 8 ten's groups (400-409 up to 470-479), the units digit goes up to 9, so '4' appears once in each. But in the last group, 480-488, units go up to 8, so '4' does not appear in the units place here.\n   - So, '4's in units place: 8 times (from 400-479, each ten's group contributes one '4').\n   - For '8's in units place: Similarly, in each ten's group except the last one, '8' appears once. But in the last group, 480-488, '8' appears once as the units digit (488). So, '8's: 9 times (from 400-479: 8 times, and 488: 1 time).\n\nWait, let me make sure:\n\n- For 400-409: units digits 0-9, so '4' once, '8' once.\n- Similarly for 410-419, ..., 470-479: each has '4' once and '8' once.\n- Then 480-488: units digits 0-8, so '4' does not appear, but '8' appears once (at 488).\n\nSo, total '4's in units place for 400-488:\n\n- 8 ten's groups (400-409 to 470-479): 8 '4's.\n- 480-488: 0 '4's.\n- Total: 8.\n\nSimilarly, '8's in units place:\n\n- 8 ten's groups: 8 '8's.\n- 480-488: 1 '8' (at 488).\n- Total: 9.\n\nSo, across all hundreds:\n\n- '4's in units place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 8 (400-488) = 38\n- '8's in units place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check:\n\nWait, for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each has 10 '4's and 10 '8's in the units place because each has 10 ten's groups, each contributing one '4' and one '8'.\n\nFor 400-488, as calculated, '4's in units place: 8, '8's:9.\n\nSo, total '4's in units place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 8 = 38\nTotal '8's in units place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n\nWait, that's correct.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the '4's and '8's across all digit places.\n\nStarting with '4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: hundreds place:89, tens place:40, units place:38\nTotal '4's = 1 + 19 + (89 + 40 + 38) = 1 + 19 + 167 = 187\n\nWait, let me compute 89 + 40 + 38:\n\n89 + 40 = 129\n129 + 38 = 167\nThen 1 + 19 = 20\n20 + 167 = 187\n\nNow, '8's:\n\n- Single-digit:1\n- Two-digit:19\n- Three-digit: hundreds place:0, tens place:39, units place:39\nTotal '8's = 1 + 19 + (0 + 39 + 39) = 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nWait, let me compute 0 + 39 +39:\n\n0 + 39 = 39\n39 + 39 = 78\nThen 1 + 19 = 20\n20 + 78 = 98\n\nWait, that can't be right because 187 '4's and 98 '8's. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, '4's:\n\n- Single-digit:1\n- Two-digit:19\n- Three-digit:\n  - Hundreds:89\n  - Tens:40\n  - Units:38\nTotal:1 + 19 + 89 + 40 +38\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake in the initial breakdown. Earlier, I considered three-digit '4's as 89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +38 (units) = 167, then added single-digit and two-digit.\n\nWait, but in the three-digit numbers, hundreds, tens, and units are all part of the same number, so I think I correctly summed them as 89 +40 +38 =167.\n\nThen, single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (167) = 1 +19=20 +167=187. That seems correct.\n\nNow, '8's:\n\n- Single-digit:1\n- Two-digit:19\n- Three-digit:\n  - Hundreds:0\n  - Tens:39\n  - Units:39\nTotal:1 +19 +0 +39 +39=1+19=20 +0=20 +39=59 +39=98.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the number of '4's is 187, and '8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in the three-digit units place for '4's and '8's?\n\nIn the three-digit numbers, from 400-488, the units digit '4's: I had 8, because in each ten's group (400-409, etc.), except the last one (480-488), '4' appears once. So, 8 ten's groups, each contributing one '4' in the units place, so 8.\n\nSimilarly, '8's in units place: in each ten's group, except the last, '8' appears once, so 8, plus one more in 488, making 9.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the three-digit numbers, the hundreds place '4's: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so '4' appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place, across all three-digit numbers, '4's:10 (100-199) +10 (200-299) +10 (300-399) +10 (400-488) =40.\n\nWait, but in 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, so 440-449 is a full ten's group, so '4' appears 10 times there.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place for 400-488, '4's:8 times.\n\nSo, yes, 89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +38 (units) =167.\n\nWait, but 89 +40 is 129, plus 38 is 167.\n\nYes.\n\nSimilarly, for '8's in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place:0\n- Tens place:10 (100-199) +10 (200-299) +10 (300-399) +9 (400-488) =39\n- Units place:10 (100-199) +10 (200-299) +10 (300-399) +9 (400-488) =39\nTotal:0 +39 +39=78, plus single-digit and two-digit:1 +19=20, so 78 +20=98.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 -98=89.\n\nWait, but let me check if I included all the pages correctly. The book has 488 pages, so up to page 488.\n\nIn the three-digit numbers, 400-488: correct.\n\nI think my calculations are correct.\n\nSo, the number of '4's printed is 187, and the number of '8's is 98, so 187 -98=89 more '4's than '8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Single-Digit Pages (1-9):**\n   - '4' appears once (page 4).\n   - '8' appears once (page 8).\n\n2. **Two-Digit Pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - '4' appears 10 times (40-49).\n     - '8' appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - '4' appears 9 times (once in each of the 9 decades).\n     - '8' appears 9 times (once in each of the 9 decades).\n   - Total for two-digit pages:\n     - '4's: 10 + 9 = 19\n     - '8's: 10 + 9 = 19\n\n3. **Three-Digit Pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - '4' appears 89 times (pages 400-488).\n     - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - '4' appears 40 times (10 in each of 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 10 in 400-488).\n     - '8' appears 39 times (10 in each of 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 9 in 400-488).\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - '4' appears 38 times (10 in each of 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 8 in 400-488).\n     - '8' appears 39 times (10 in each of 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 9 in 400-488).\n   - Total for three-digit pages:\n     - '4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 38 (units) = 167\n     - '8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - '4's: 1 (single-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 167 (three-digit) = 187\n   - '8's: 1 (single-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - More '4's than '8's: 187 - 98 = 89\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe number of '4's printed exceeds the number of '8's by \\boxed{89}."

    "text": " I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears and how many times the digit 8 appears, then subtract the two to find the difference.\n\nFirst, I should think about how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers range from 1 to 488. So, pages 1 through 9 are single-digit, 10 through 99 are two-digit, and 100 through 488 are three-digit numbers.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to break it down into single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit page numbers separately and count the number of 4's and 8's in each place (units, tens, hundreds).\n\nLet's start with the single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digits 4 and 8 each appear exactly once. So, for single-digit pages, both 4 and 8 occur once.\n\nNow, moving on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each digit can appear in the tens place or the units place. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place and how many times they appear in the units place.\n\nFirst, for the tens place in two-digit numbers:\n- The tens digit cycles from 1 to 9. So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for pages 40-49, which is 10 times.\n- Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for pages 80-89, which is also 10 times.\n\nNext, for the units place in two-digit numbers:\n- For each ten (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 10 to 99, there are 9 sets of ten, each contributing one 4. So, 9 times for 4.\n- Similarly, the digit 8 appears once in the units place for each set of ten, so 9 times for 8.\n\nWait, but hold on, in the two-digit numbers, from 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers. Each ten has 10 numbers, and the units digit cycles 0-9. So, for each digit (4 and 8), in the units place, it's 9 times because there are 9 sets of ten (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99). But actually, from 10 to 99, inclusive, that's 90 numbers, so for each digit in the units place, it's 9 times, but wait, 10-19 has units digits 0-9, so 4 appears once in 14, 8 appears once in 18. Similarly, 20-29 has 24 and 28, etc. So, yes, 9 times each for units place.\n\nWait, but actually, from 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers, so for each digit in the units place, each digit 0-9 appears exactly 9 times. So, 4 appears 9 times in the units place, and 8 appears 9 times in the units place.\n\nBut wait, when I count the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (40-49) and 8 appears 10 times (80-89). So, for two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. Similarly, the total number of 8's is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because in the single-digit numbers, 4 and 8 each appeared once, so for two-digit numbers, adding 19 each, but let me check again.\n\nWait, no, in the single-digit numbers, 4 and 8 each appeared once. So, for single-digit, 4:1, 8:1. For two-digit, 4's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) =19, and 8's:10 +9=19. So, total so far: 4's=1+19=20, 8's=1+19=20.\n\nWait, but that would mean that up to page 99, both 4's and 8's are equal. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. So, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit 4 only goes up to 488, not 499.\n\nSo, I need to count the number of 4's and 8's in the hundreds, tens, and units places for three-digit numbers from 100 to 488.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\nFirst, hundreds place:\n- For hundreds digit 1: 100-199. So, 100-199 has 100 numbers. The hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's here in the hundreds place.\n- For hundreds digit 2: 200-299. Similarly, hundreds digit is 2, so no 4's or 8's in the hundreds place.\n- For hundreds digit 3: 300-399. Hundreds digit is 3, so again, no 4's or 8's in the hundreds place.\n- For hundreds digit 4: 400-488. Here, the hundreds digit is 4, so every page from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\nNow, 8's in hundreds place: Since the hundreds digit can only be 1,2,3,4 in our case, there are no 8's in the hundreds place for any three-digit page numbers, because the book only goes up to 488. So, 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nNext, tens place for three-digit numbers:\n\nWe need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place from 100 to 488.\n\nLet's break it down by hundreds:\n\n1. Hundreds digit 1 (100-199):\n   - The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each hundred. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9, and for each cycle, 4 and 8 each appear once in the tens place.\n   - So, for 100-199, the tens digit 4 appears in 140-149, which is 10 times.\n   - Similarly, tens digit 8 appears in 180-189, which is 10 times.\n   \n2. Hundreds digit 2 (200-299):\n   - Similarly, tens digit 4 appears in 240-249, 10 times.\n   - Tens digit 8 appears in 280-289, 10 times.\n   \n3. Hundreds digit 3 (300-399):\n   - Tens digit 4 appears in 340-349, 10 times.\n   - Tens digit 8 appears in 380-389, 10 times.\n   \n4. Hundreds digit 4 (400-488):\n   - Now, this is where it gets a bit tricky because the hundreds digit is 4, and the page numbers go up to 488, not 499.\n   - So, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). Wait, no, actually, 400-488 includes tens digits from 0 to 8, but the units digits go up to 8 for the last page.\n   - Wait, actually, let's think carefully. For the hundreds digit 4, the tens digit can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, but only up to 488, so when the tens digit is 8, the units digit can only go up to 8, not 9. So, for tens digit 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10.\n\nSo, for hundreds digit 4:\n   - Tens digit 4: 440-449, which is 10 numbers.\n   - Tens digit 8: 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place for hundreds digit 4:\n   - 4 appears 10 times.\n   - 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, now, let's sum up the tens place counts:\n- For 4's in tens place:\n   - Hundreds 1: 10\n   - Hundreds 2:10\n   - Hundreds 3:10\n   - Hundreds 4:10\n   - Total: 10+10+10+10 =40\n\n- For 8's in tens place:\n   - Hundreds 1:10\n   - Hundreds 2:10\n   - Hundreds 3:10\n   - Hundreds 4:9\n   - Total:10+10+10+9=39\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, in the tens place, 4's appear 40 times and 8's appear 39 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place for three-digit numbers (100-488).\n\nAgain, let's break it down by hundreds:\n\n1. Hundreds digit 1 (100-199):\n   - For each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each tens digit.\n   - So, for each tens group (e.g., 100-109, 110-119, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place (e.g., 104, 114, etc.).\n   - There are 10 tens groups (0-9), each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 10 times for 4.\n   - Similarly, 8 appears once in each tens group, so 10 times for 8.\n\n2. Hundreds digit 2 (200-299):\n   - Same logic: 10 times for 4 in units place, 10 times for 8.\n\n3. Hundreds digit 3 (300-399):\n   - Same: 10 times for 4, 10 times for 8.\n\n4. Hundreds digit 4 (400-488):\n   - Now, we have to consider that the page numbers go up to 488, so the units digit goes up to 8 when the tens digit is 8.\n   - For each tens digit from 0 to 8, the units digit cycles 0-9, except when the tens digit is 8, where it only goes up to 8.\n   - So, for tens digits 0-7, each has 10 units digits (0-9), so 4 appears once in each, so 8 times (tens digits 0-7) \u00d71 =8 times.\n   - For tens digit 8, units digits go from 0-8, so 4 appears once (at 484), and 8 appears once (at 488).\n   - Wait, but let's count carefully. For hundreds digit 4, the units digit 4 appears in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. So, that's 9 times. Wait, but earlier I thought that for tens digits 0-7, units digit 4 appears once each, which would be 8 times, but actually, when the tens digit is 8, units digit 4 is at 484, which is within 488. So, total 9 times.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to consider that for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\n- Tens digits 0-7: For each, units digit 4 appears once, so 8 times.\n- Tens digit 8: Units digit 4 appears once (484).\n- So, total 8+1=9 times for 4 in units place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in units place:\n- Tens digits 0-7: Each has units digit 8 once, so 8 times.\n- Tens digit 8: Units digit 8 appears once (488).\n- So, total 8+1=9 times for 8 in units place.\n\nWait, but wait, when the tens digit is 8, the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included. So, yes, units digit 8 appears once in 488.\n\nSo, in the units place for hundreds digit 4:\n   - 4 appears 9 times.\n   - 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. For hundreds digit 4, from 400 to 488:\n\n- For each tens digit from 0 to 8:\n   - Tens digit 0: 400-409 \u2192 units digits 0-9, so 404 has a 4.\n   - Tens digit 1: 410-419 \u2192 414.\n   - Similarly, up to tens digit 7: 470-479 \u2192 474.\n   - Tens digit 8: 480-488 \u2192 484 and 488.\n\nSo, for units digit 4: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484 \u2192 9 times.\nFor units digit 8: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488 \u2192 9 times.\n\nYes, so 9 each.\n\nSo, summarizing units place for three-digit numbers:\n- Hundreds 1: 10 (4's), 10 (8's)\n- Hundreds 2:10,10\n- Hundreds 3:10,10\n- Hundreds 4:9,9\nTotal:\n- 4's:10+10+10+9=39\n- 8's:10+10+10+9=39\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier in the tens place, 4's had 40 and 8's had 39, but in units place, both have 39.\n\nWait, but let me check again. For hundreds digit 1,2,3: each contributes 10 units digits 4 and 10 units digits 8. So, 3 hundreds \u00d710=30 for 4's and 30 for 8's.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4: 9 each, so total 30+9=39 for 4's and 30+9=39 for 8's.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, now, putting it all together for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place:\n   - 4's:89\n   - 8's:0\n\n- Tens place:\n   - 4's:40\n   - 8's:39\n\n- Units place:\n   - 4's:39\n   - 8's:39\n\nSo, total for three-digit numbers:\n- 4's:89+40+39=168\n- 8's:0+39+39=78\n\nWait, let me add that again:\n- Hundreds:89\n- Tens:40\n- Units:39\nTotal 4's:89+40=129, 129+39=168\n\nFor 8's:\n- Hundreds:0\n- Tens:39\n- Units:39\nTotal:0+39=39, 39+39=78\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's add up all the 4's and 8's from single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nFrom single-digit:\n- 4's:1\n- 8's:1\n\nFrom two-digit:\n- 4's:19\n- 8's:19\n\nFrom three-digit:\n- 4's:168\n- 8's:78\n\nSo, total 4's:1+19+168=188\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's printed is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot, but let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, let me go through each part again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nSingle-digit:\n- 4:1\n- 8:1\n\nTwo-digit:\n- Tens place:4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89)\n- Units place:4 appears 9 times (14,24,...,94), 8 appears 9 times (18,28,...,98)\n- So, total 4's:10+9=19\n- Total 8's:10+9=19\n\nThree-digit:\n- Hundreds place:4 appears 89 times (400-488)\n- Tens place:\n   - Hundreds 1,2,3: each contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 for 8\n   - Hundreds 4:4 appears 10 times (440-449), 8 appears 9 times (480-488)\n   - So, total 4's:3\u00d710 +10=40\n   - Total 8's:3\u00d710 +9=39\n- Units place:\n   - Hundreds 1,2,3: each contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 for 8\n   - Hundreds 4:4 appears 9 times, 8 appears 9 times\n   - So, total 4's:3\u00d710 +9=39\n   - Total 8's:3\u00d710 +9=39\n- So, total 4's in three-digit:89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (units)=168\n- Total 8's:0 (hundreds) +39 (tens) +39 (units)=78\n\nAdding up:\n- 4's:1+19+168=188\n- 8's:1+19+78=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " I need to solve this step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should figure out how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by understanding how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers range from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers go from 1 up to 488, which means the highest page number is a three-digit number.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to break down the problem into units, tens, and hundreds places separately. That is, I'll calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place across all page numbers.\n\nLet's start with the digit 4.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 10, the digit 4 appears once (at page 4).\n   - Since the book has 488 pages, there are 488 / 10 = 48 full groups of 10 pages, and then 8 extra pages (481 to 488).\n   - In each full group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 groups * 1 = 48 times.\n   - Now, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once in this group as well (page 484).\n   - Total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for pages 40-49, which is 10 times.\n   - Similarly, from 101 to 200, it's 140-149, another 10 times.\n   - Continuing this way, up to 400-488.\n   - Let's calculate how many full hundreds we have. 488 pages mean 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488).\n   - In each full hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 0 for 401-409, 8 for 480-488, and 4 for 440-449. Wait, no, actually, the tens digit for 401-488 is 0 for 401-409, then 1 for 410-419, up to 8 for 480-488. So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 times.\n   - Therefore, in the partial hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n   - Total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place?\n   - From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these pages has a 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - So, 89 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\n- Total 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me think again. The hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So yes, 89 times. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I add 49 + 50 + 89, that's 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 10, 8 appears once (page 8).\n   - There are 48 full groups of 10 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups) and then 8 extra pages (481-488).\n   - Each full group contributes 1, so 48 * 1 = 48.\n   - In the last group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (page 488).\n   - Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89 in each hundred.\n   - From 1-100: 80-89, 10 times.\n   - From 101-200: 180-189, 10 times.\n   - From 201-300: 280-289, 10 times.\n   - From 301-400: 380-389, 10 times.\n   - Now, from 401-488: The tens digit is 0 for 401-409, 1 for 410-419, up to 8 for 480-488.\n   - So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-488, which is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 pages, but actually, from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 only for 480-488, which is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 pages. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 times. So, in the partial hundred, 9 times.\n   - So, total tens place 8's: 4 full hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 9 in the last partial hundred, so 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, yes, 49 in total.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 0 8's.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\n- Total 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check again because I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me recount the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, for each hundred, 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contributes 10 8's. So, from 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought the hundreds place was 0, so total 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nEach 10 pages, 8 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last partial group, 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once at 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 +1=49. That's correct.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40, plus 9 in the last partial hundred, so 49. So, total 49 in tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I calculated 4's, I got 188, and 8's as 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me check again because maybe I overcounted somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check that again.\n\nFor the hundreds place, the 4's appear from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think: from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, yes, 89.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, 4's: in each hundred, from 0-99, 100-199, etc., the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers each. So, 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in the last partial hundred, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10. So, 40 +10=50. That's correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: Each 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 48 full groups, 48, plus in the last group, 484, so 49. Correct.\n\nSo, 49 +50 +89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nTens place: 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal: 98.\n\nSo, 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check again.\n\nIn the tens place, for each hundred, 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contributes 10 8's. So, from 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 times.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, right? So, 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49.\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 +49=98.\n\nSo, 4's:188, 8's:98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I overcounted the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check how many numbers are from 400 to 488.\n\n488 -400 +1=89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nWait, but when I think about it, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nSo, 4's total: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's total:49 (units)+49 (tens)=98.\n\nSo, difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a big difference. Let me check another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately, but perhaps I made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me recount the tens place for 8's.\n\nFrom 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nIt's 80-89: 10 times.\n\n180-189:10.\n\n280-289:10.\n\n380-389:10.\n\n480-488:9 times.\n\nSo, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place:\n\n40-49:10.\n\n140-149:10.\n\n240-249:10.\n\n340-349:10.\n\n440-449:10.\n\nSo, 10*5=50. Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 50 in total. That's correct.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my counts are accurate.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure because I remember in some similar problems, the difference is smaller, but maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\n\nEach digit place (units, tens, hundreds) contributes a certain number of 4's and 8's.\n\nBut perhaps another way to approach it is to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position separately.\n\nWait, let me try that.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10)=48 full cycles, each contributing 1, and then in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), 4 appears once. So, 48+1=49.\n\nNumber of 8's: Similarly, floor(488/10)=48, and in the remaining 8 pages, 8 appears once. So, 48+1=49.\n\nSo, units place: 4's=49, 8's=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100)=4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 4's in tens place:4*10 +10=50.\n\nNumber of 8's: floor(488/100)=4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place. Then, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total 8's in tens place:4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nNumber of 8's: The hundreds digit is 8 from 800-888, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, I think that's correct. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
