    "text": " So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check if I considered all cases correctly, especially in the tens and units places. For the 4's in the units place: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. For the 8's in the units place: same logic, 8,18,...,488. ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. For the 4's in the tens place: each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, and there are 5 hundreds (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is not a full hundred, but since we're only counting the tens digit, 40-49,140-149, etc., up to 440-449. So, 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Correct.
