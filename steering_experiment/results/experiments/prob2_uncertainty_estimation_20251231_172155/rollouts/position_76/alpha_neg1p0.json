    "text": " So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers? 488 -400 +1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Correct. So, 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when counting, especially in the hundreds place, I might have overlapped counts. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this by considering each digit position separately and counting the number of 4's and 8's in each position across all page numbers from 1 to 488. Let me try that approach for both digits to ensure accuracy. Starting with the digit 4: 1. **Units place:** As before, 4 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's the floor division of 488 by 10, which is 48, plus 1 if the remainder is >=4. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, which is greater than 4, so we add 1, making it 49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** In the tens place, 4 appears in the range 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many hundreds are there up to 488? There are 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500, but since we stop at 488, the last hundred is 401-488). Wait, actually, each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's:40+10=50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. Now, for the digit 8: 1. **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so floor(488/10)=48, and since 488 mod 10=8 >=8, we add 1, making it 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** In the tens place, 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each hundred contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, total tens place 8's:40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** As before, no numbers from 800-899 are present, so 0. So, total 8's:49+49=98. Therefore, the difference is 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10, so 5 blocks give 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 89, so 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10, except the last which contributes 9.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No pages have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Similarly, for the 8's in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 is the last page. So, 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers. So, 480-489 would be 10, but since we stop at 488, it's 9.

Because sometimes when counting in different digit positions, there might be overlaps, but in this case, since we're counting each digit position separately, it's okay. Another way to check is to consider that in each position, the count is accurate. For example, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. But in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. In the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times and 8 appears 0. So, the difference is (50+89) for 4's and (49+0) for 8's.

This gives 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. This gives 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488. This gives 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This gives 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This gives 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** None, as page numbers don't reach 800.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"
