    "text": " Maybe I'm missing something, but I think that's correct. Wait, let me think again. When counting the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. For the 8's in the tens place, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), which is correct. So, 49 units, 49 tens, 0 hundreds, total 98 eights. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Hmm, maybe that's correct. But let me think if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position. For a 488-page book, let's consider each digit position separately. **Units place:** For 488 pages, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times each digit (0-9) appears in the units place is either floor(488/10) or floor(488/10)+1. Specifically, the first 480 pages (48*10) will have each digit appearing 48 times, and the remaining 8 pages (481-488) will add 1 more to the digits 1-8. So, for 4: it appears 48 times in the first 480 pages, plus 1 more in 484, so 49 times. For 8: it appears 48 times in the first 480 pages, plus 1 more in 488, so 49 times. So, units place: 49 fours, 49 eights. **Tens place:** The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each set of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for 488 pages, we have 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), and then 80 pages in the 400-488 range. For each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 4 hundreds would have 4*10=40 fours. But wait, the last hundred is 400-488, which is only 89 pages, but the tens digit in 400-488 runs from 0-8 in the tens place (since 488 is 4-8-8). So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit cycles from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, for the tens digit 4, it's in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 4*10 (from each hundred up to 300-399) +10 (from 440-449) =50. For the eights in the tens place: in each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, etc., which is 10 per hundred. So, up to 300-399, that's 3*10=30. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total eights in tens place: 30 +9=39. Wait, that's different from my earlier count. Earlier, I thought it was 49, but now I'm getting 39. Hmm, where did I go wrong? Let me check. When I considered the tens place earlier, I thought of 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets. Each of the first four sets (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, but the last set (480-488) has 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. But now, using the hundreds approach, I'm getting 3*10 +9=39. Wait, that's a discrepancy. Which one is correct? Let me list them out: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, the correct count is 49 eights in the tens place. So, earlier approach was correct, and the hundreds approach was wrong because I didn't account for the 400-488 range properly. So, the correct count is 49 eights in the tens place. Therefore, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) =98. So, the earlier calculation was correct. Therefore, the difference is 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. But wait, let me make sure I didn't double-count or miss any numbers. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position again. Let's try another method. For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear. **Units place:** As before, 4 appears 49 times, 8 appears 49 times. **Tens place:** 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. Total 8's:49+49+0=98. Difference:188-98=90. So, yes, 90 is the correct answer. I think I'm confident now that the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. This is 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488.

    "text": " Hmm, that's a 90 difference. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's? Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. And for 8's, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, yes, that's 9. So, 49 eights in tens place. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly? Let me think about the units place for 8's: 8,18,...,488. The last number is 488, which is included. So, how many terms? The first term is 8, which is 8=8+10*0, then 18=8+10*1, up to 488=8+10*48. So, that's 49 terms. Correct. For the tens place, 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10*4 +9=49. Correct. So, 49+49=98. So, 4's:188, 8's:98. Difference is 90. So, the answer is 90. But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes when counting digits, especially in the hundreds place, I might have made a mistake. Let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 -400 +1=89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. Correct. So, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, 188-98=90. So, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding how many more 4's are printed than 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., each block contributing 10 occurrences. There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing one '4'.\n\n   **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., each block contributing 10 occurrences. However, the last block (480-488) has only 9 numbers. Thus, total occurrences are 49.\n\n   **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Subtract the number of '8's from the number of '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of '4's printed exceeds the number of '8's by 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Wait, from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total 188 fours. And 98 eights. So, the difference is 90. Hmm, I think that's correct. Maybe I should check another way. Alternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a different counting method. Let me try another approach. For each digit position, count the number of times 4 and 8 appear. Let's start with the units digit: For units digit, in numbers 1-488, how many times does 4 appear? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full cycles, and then 8 more numbers (481-488), where the units digit is 4 at 484. So, 48*1 +1=49. Similarly, for 8: 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full cycles, and in the last partial cycle (481-488), 8 appears at 488. So, 48*1 +1=49. So, units place: 49 fours, 49 eights. Now, tens place: For the tens digit, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So, in 488 numbers, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0-8 (since 488 is the last). So, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears once in 401-410 (404), once in 411-420 (414), once in 421-430 (424), once in 431-440 (434), once in 441-450 (444), and once in 451-460 (454), 461-470 (464), 471-480 (474), and 481-488 (484). Wait, but 484 is within 481-488, so that's 9 occurrences in the tens place in 401-488. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 5 sets of 10. Hmm, maybe this approach is getting confusing. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to stick with the initial counting. So, in the tens place, for 4's, we have 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449, which is 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. Similarly, for 8's in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four sets contributes 10 eights, and the last set contributes 9 eights (since 480-488 is 9 numbers). So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Now, hundreds place: For 4's, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. For 8's, since 800-899 is beyond 488, there are 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 188. Total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) =98. Difference:188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.

Let's calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position separately again, but perhaps more carefully. For 4's: Units place: numbers ending with 4. From 4 to 484, every 10 numbers. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, (484 -4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: numbers where tens digit is 4. That's 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers. There are 5 blocks, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: numbers from 400-488. 488-400+1=89. So, 89. Total 4's:49+50+89=188. Correct. For 8's: Units place: numbers ending with 8. 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: numbers where tens digit is 8. So, 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, and the last block has 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0, as before. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Hmm, maybe I'm correct after all. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me think again. Wait, in the tens place for 8's, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480 is the first, then 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers, so yes, 9. So, 480-488: 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place there. So, 49 in units and 49 in tens, totaling 98. So, yes, 188-98=90.

From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Yes, correct. And for the 8's, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place.

Maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's digit by digit again, but perhaps I made a mistake in one of the counts. Let's try again for 4's: Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: Each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. There are 5 hundred blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, no, actually, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each 100 numbers, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 0-488, how many hundreds? 5 hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. In each of the first four hundreds, there's a full set of 10 numbers with tens digit 4. The last hundred, 400-488, also has a full set from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, and then 450-488 doesn't add any more 4's in the tens place. Wait, no, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10. So, 5 sets of 10, totaling 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89. Total 4's:49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. Last term is 488, so number of terms is ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, as before. So, total 8's:49+49=98. Therefore, 188-98=90.

Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).

    "text": " Maybe I'm correct. Wait, but let me think again. When counting the tens place for 8's, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, that's correct. So, total eights in tens place:49. So, yes, 98 eights in total. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, but wait, let me think if I missed any page numbers. For example, in the hundreds place for 4's, does 400-488 include 89 numbers? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89, yes. So, that's correct. And for 8's, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, which is correct. So, I think the answer is 90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when counting, you might include or exclude certain numbers. Let me try another approach to confirm. Alternatively, I can write a small program or use a different counting method. But since I'm doing this manually, let me try another way. For 4's: - Units place: numbers ending with 4. From 4 to 484, step 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. - Tens place: numbers where tens digit is 4. These are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 5*10=50. Correct. - Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: - Units place: numbers ending with 8. From 8 to 488, step 10. Number of terms: ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. - Tens place: numbers where tens digit is 8. These are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks have 10 numbers each, and the last block has 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. - Hundreds place: 0. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, difference is 188-98=90. So, yes, I think 90 is correct. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. When counting the hundreds place for 4's, 400-488 includes 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. But when counting the tens and units places, do any of these numbers overlap? For example, 440-449 has both a 4 in the hundreds and tens place. But in our counting, we're just counting each digit separately, so it's fine. Each occurrence is counted individually, so even if a number has multiple 4's, each digit is counted. So, for example, 444 would have three 4's, each counted in units, tens, and hundreds. So, our counting method is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, if a number like 488 has both 8 in tens and units, each is counted separately. So, 488 would contribute two 8's, one in tens and one in units. So, our counting is correct.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Let me try another approach for the units place of 4's and 8's. For units place: 4's: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then every 10 numbers. So, 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Similarly, for 8's: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. So, units place: 4's=49, 8's=49.

For 8's, tens digit 8: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. So, first four blocks have 10 each, and the last block has 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 4's tens:50, 8's tens:49. Hundreds place: 4's:400-488, which is 89 numbers. 8's:0. So, 4's total:49+50+89=188, 8's total:49+49+0=98. Difference:188-98=90. Yeah, I think that's right.
