    "text": " From 480-488, that's 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, that's correct. So, 49 eights in the tens place. So, 49+49=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me think again. Did I count correctly? Let me try a different approach. Maybe count the number of times each digit appears in each position. For the units place, for both 4 and 8, it's 49 each, as I found. For the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times. For the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. Total 8's:49+49+0=98. So, difference is 188-98=90. Yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can think about how many times each digit appears in each position up to 488. Let me confirm the units place count. For units digit, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, and then in the 49th cycle, the 4 appears once at 484. So, 48*1 +1=49. Similarly for 8, it's the same: 48 full cycles (each contributing one 8) and then 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in units place. For tens place, 4 appears in 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. That's 5 sets, each 10 numbers, so 50. 8 appears in 80-89,180-189,...,480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set is only 9 numbers, so 49. For hundreds place, 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, and 8 doesn't appear at all. So, yes, the counts are correct. Therefore, the difference is 90. I think that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No pages in the book have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " From 480-488, that's 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, that's correct. So, 49 eights in tens place. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, it's easy to miscount. Let me think of another approach. Maybe using a formula or a more systematic way. For the number of times a digit appears in a certain position, we can use a formula. Let's consider each digit position separately. **Units place for 4's:** The number of times 4 appears in the units place up to N can be calculated as floor((N + 1) / 10). So, for N=488, it's floor(489/10)=48. But wait, earlier I counted 49. Hmm, perhaps the formula is floor(N / 10) + 1 if the units digit is >=4. Wait, maybe I should think differently. Alternatively, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is equal to ((N - d) // 10) + 1 if d <= N % 10, else ((N - d) // 10) + 1. Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Alternatively, for the units place, every 10 numbers contribute exactly one 4. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 /10=48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4, so 48. But then, the last partial group is 481-488, which includes 484, so that's one more 4. So, 48 +1=49. So, that's correct. Similarly, for the tens place, the number of times 4 appears in the tens place can be calculated by looking at how many complete hundreds are there, each contributing 10 times, and then the partial hundred. So, for tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-100: 40-49 (10), 101-200:140-149 (10), etc. Up to 400-488: 440-449 (10) and 480-488 doesn't contribute to tens place 4's. Wait, no, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10. So, from 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10. So, total tens place 4's:40+10=50. Correct. Similarly, for hundreds place, 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units place: similar approach. Each 10 numbers contribute one 8. From 1-488, how many 8's in units place? 488 /10=48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the last partial group is 481-488, which includes 488, so that's one more 8. So, 48+1=49. Tens place: For tens digit 8, each hundred contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-100:80-89 (10), 101-200:180-189 (10), 201-300:280-289 (10), 301-400:380-389 (10), and 401-488:480-488 (9). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. Hundreds place: 8 doesn't appear in hundreds place because 800-899 is beyond 488. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, the answer should be 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in the tens and hundreds places, it's easy to make an off-by-one error. Let me try another approach. Alternatively, I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position separately and sum them up. Let's try that again. For 4's: - Units place: For every 10 numbers, there's one 4. From 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, so 48. But wait, does the last partial set (481-488) include another 4 in the units place? 484 is the last one, which is within 481-488. So, that's 48*1=48, plus 1 more (484), so 49. Correct. - Tens place: For every 100 numbers, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-100: 40-49 (10), 101-200:140-149 (10), 201-300:240-249 (10), 301-400:340-349 (10), 401-488:440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct. - Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. Correct. Total 4's:49+50+89=188. For 8's: - Units place: Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers. From 1-488, how many? 488/10=48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Plus, does the last set (481-488) include an 8 in the units place? 488 is included, so that's another 8. So, 48+1=49. Correct. - Tens place: For every 100 numbers, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's 9. So, total tens place eights:10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. - Hundreds place: As before, none, since 800+ is beyond 488. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.
