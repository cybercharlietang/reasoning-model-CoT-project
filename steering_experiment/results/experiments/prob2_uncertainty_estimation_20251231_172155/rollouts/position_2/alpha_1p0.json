    "text": " Page numbers go from 1 to 488, so each page is a single number, either one, two, or three digits. \n\nMaybe I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8, and then subtract the two counts to find the difference. That makes sense. So, I need to calculate the total number of 4's and 8's in each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately. I'll handle the units place first. For the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, in 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once and the digit 8 appears once. \n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 numbers (since 488 = 48*10 + 8). \n\nIn each complete block of 10, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 blocks, that would be 48*1 = 48 fours and 48*1 = 48 eights from the units place.\n\nNow, what about the partial block of 8 numbers, which is 481 to 488. Let me list the units digits: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in this partial block, the units digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the units digit 8 appears once (at 488). So, that's one 4 and one 8 from the units place in the partial block.\n\nAdding that up, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, 4's and 8's are equal.\n\nNext, I should check the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred.\n\nSo, for the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 40-49. So, that's 10 fours in the tens place per hundred. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place per hundred (80-89).\n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 pages beyond that (401-488). \n\nWait, no, actually, 488 is 4*100 + 88, so that's correct. So, for each of the 4 full hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4*10 = 40 fours. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times per hundred, so 4*10 = 40 eights.\n\nNow, what about the partial hundred from 401-488? The tens digit here ranges from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 480-488). Let me check how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place in this partial hundred.\n\nLooking at 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 fours in the tens place. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in this partial hundred.\n\nWait, but hold on, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here. So, for the tens place in the partial hundred:\n\n- 4 appears 10 times (440-449)\n- 8 appears 9 times (480-488)\n\nSo, adding to the earlier counts from the full hundreds:\n\nTotal fours in tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 (from partial) = 50\nTotal eights in tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 (from partial) = 49\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times. So, the tens place contributes 50 fours and 49 eights.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers 100 and above. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, which isn't printed, I think. So, starting from 100, the hundreds digit is 1, then 2, 3, 4, etc., up to 488.\n\nWait, but 488 is a three-digit number, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let me see how many times each digit appears in the hundreds place.\n\nFrom 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so 1 appears 100 times.\nFrom 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, so 2 appears 100 times.\nFrom 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, so 3 appears 100 times.\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so 4 appears 89 times (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers).\n\nWait, no, actually, 400-488 is 89 numbers (400, 401, ..., 488), so the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, but I'm only interested in 4's and 8's in the hundreds place. So, let's see:\n\n- 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 times.\n- 8 appears in the hundreds place? Well, in 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let me sum up all the occurrences:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nEach block of 10 has one 4 and one 8. There are 48 complete blocks (480 pages) and then 8 more pages (481-488). In those 8 pages, units digits are 1-8, so one 4 and one 8. So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nIn each full hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and 8 appears 10 times (80-89). So, 4 full hundreds give 4*10=40 for each. Then, in the partial hundred (401-488), 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8. That adds up correctly.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, and there are 89 numbers, so 89 times. 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place in this book. So, 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should look at each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4, but only for the first 100 pages, the hundreds digit is 0, right? No, actually, from 1 to 99, the hundreds digit is 0, from 100 to 199 it's 1, and so on up to 400 to 488 where it's 4. So, maybe I should calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately and then sum them up.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's in each place.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, etc. Now, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets and then 8 more pages. So, in each of the 48 complete sets, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so the 484th page would have a 4 in the units place. So, that's one more 4. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 pages. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete tens, which is 48, plus any extra in the last partial set. Since 488 is 48*10 + 8, so the last partial set is 8 numbers, which includes 484, so that's one more 4. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That seems right.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. In each 100-page block, the digit in the tens place is 4 for exactly 10 consecutive pages. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, etc. So, how many complete 100-page blocks are there in 488 pages? That's 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then a partial block from 401-488. So, in each complete block, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages, so that's 4*10 = 40 times. Now, in the partial block from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for pages 440-449, which is 10 pages. Wait, but 488 is less than 449? No, 488 is way beyond 449, so 440-449 is within 401-488. So, that's another 10 pages where the tens digit is 4. So, total 4's in the tens place would be 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. From 1-100, tens digit 4 is from 40-49: 10 pages. Similarly, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 times 10, but wait, in 401-488, 440-449 is within that range, so that's 5 blocks? Wait, no, the first block is 1-100, so 40-49, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5*10 = 50. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 488 is 4*100 + 88, so the last block is 401-488, which includes 440-449, so yes, that's correct. So, 5 blocks, each with 10 4's, so 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. So, how many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 only for pages 400 to 488, which is 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89.\n\nLet me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4's, in each set of 10 pages, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more 8. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 1 to 480, it's 48 sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, 481-488: 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 8 appears once, so yes, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, the tens place for 8's. The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. So, each complete 100-page block has 10 pages where the tens digit is 8. So, how many complete blocks are there? From 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. So, in each of the first four blocks, there's 10 pages with tens digit 8. So, 4 blocks * 10 = 40. Now, in the last block, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488 inclusive). Wait, 480-488 is 9 pages, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 1-100: 80-89, that's 10 pages. 101-200: 180-189, another 10. 201-300: 280-289, another 10. 301-400: 380-389, another 10. Then, 401-488: 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, so total 4's are 188, and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), 484 has a 4 in the units place, so +1, total 49.\n\n- Tens place: 5 blocks where tens digit is 4: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 4's, so 5*10=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in 481-488, 488 has an 8, so +1, total 49.\n\n- Tens place: 4 complete blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Then, in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so +9, total 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, as the book doesn't reach 800.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should look at the digits in the units place and the tens place separately because the problem is about counting specific digits, not the numbers themselves.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every set of ten pages, like 1-10, 11-20, and so on, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. That means for each ten, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, if I can figure out how many complete sets of ten there are in 488 pages, I can count how many 4's and 8's are in the units place.\n\nWait, but 488 isn't a multiple of ten, so there will be some extra pages beyond the last complete set of ten. Let me calculate how many complete sets there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of ten, and then 8 extra pages. So, in each of those 48 sets, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so that would be 48 4's and 48 8's from the units place. Then, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, the units digits include a 4 and an 8. Therefore, the units place contributes 49 4's and 49 8's. Wait, is that right? Because 48 sets give 48 each, and the extra 8 pages have one 4 and one 8, so adding 1 to each, making it 49 each. Hmm, maybe.\n\nWait, actually, when I have 488 pages, the last page is 488, so the extra pages after 480 are 481 to 488, which is 8 pages. So, the units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, yes, in the units place, we have a 4 and an 8 in this extra set. So, total units place 4's: 48 (from the complete sets) +1 (from the extra set) =49. Similarly, units place 8's: 48+1=49. So, from the units place, 4's and 8's are equal.\n\nNow, I should also check the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, in each hundred, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the digit 8 appears 10 times as well. So, for 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each of the 4 complete hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4*10=40 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times per hundred, so 4*10=40 times.\n\nNow, the remaining 88 pages are from 401 to 488. Let me check the tens digits in this range. From 401-410, the tens digit is 0. 411-420, tens digit is 1. 421-430, tens digit is 2. 431-440, tens digit is 3. 441-450, tens digit is 4. 451-460, tens digit is 5. 461-470, tens digit is 6. 471-480, tens digit is 7. 481-488, tens digit is 8.\n\nWait, so in the tens place, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in this last partial hundred?\n\nLooking at 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Each tens digit appears 10 times except for the last one, which is 8 and appears 8 times because 481-488 is only 8 pages. So, for the tens digit 4, it appears from 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. For the tens digit 8, it's from 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times.\n\nSo, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and the tens digit 8 appears 8 times.\n\nTherefore, total tens place 4's: 40 (from complete hundreds) +10 (from partial) =50.\n\nTotal tens place 8's: 40 (from complete hundreds) +8 (from partial) =48.\n\nSo, from the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 48 times. So, the difference in the tens place is 50-48=2 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, I should also check the hundreds place because in 488, the hundreds digit is 4, 4 in 400-488. Wait, but wait, the hundreds digit is only relevant for numbers 100 and above. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's 0. From 100-199, hundreds digit is 1. 200-299, it's 2. 300-399, it's 3. 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, how many times does the digit 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). Wait, no, 400-488 is 89 pages, but the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nSimilarly, the hundreds digit 8 would appear in 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit 8 never appears. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nWait, but wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check: from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 pages. Each of these has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times. So, yes, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, now, let me sum up all the occurrences:\n\n- Units place: 4's=49, 8's=49\n- Tens place: 4's=50, 8's=48\n- Hundreds place: 4's=89, 8's=0\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 49+48=97.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -97=91.\n\nWait, that seems a lot. But wait, I think I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place because the hundreds digit is only 4 from 400-488, which is 89 times, but when considering the digit counts, each page number has a hundreds digit, but for numbers less than 100, it's zero. So, actually, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times, but the hundreds digit 8 doesn't appear at all, so 0 times.\n\nWait, but in the problem, it's about how many times each digit is printed. So, the hundreds digit is only present in page numbers 100 and above. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit isn't printed, so it's not counted. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times, and 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\n8's: units (49) + tens (48) + hundreds (0) =49+48=97.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -97=91.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nFirst, units place: for each 10 pages, one 4 and one 8. 488 pages have 48 complete sets of 10, which gives 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have a 4 and an 8 in the units place, so 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. 4 hundreds give 40 each. Then, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, 40+10=50 for 4's, and 40+8=48 for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, 89 pages, so hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. 8's in hundreds place: 0 times. That's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but I'm a bit surprised it's so high. Let me think again.\n\nWait, but in the units place, I counted 49 each, but is that correct? Let me check: 488 pages, so units digits cycle every 10. 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 and one 8. So, 48 each. Then, the last partial cycle is 8 pages, which are 481-488, so units digits 1-8. So, in that partial cycle, 4 appears once, and 8 appears once. So, total units 4's:48+1=49, same for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's. So, 4 hundreds give 40 each. Then, in the last 88 pages, which is 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, with each digit appearing 10 times except the last one, which appears 8 times. So, for 4 in the tens place, it's 10 times (441-450). For 8, it's 8 times (481-488). So, 40+10=50 for 4's, and 40+8=48 for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, from 400-488, which is 89 pages, each has a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 times. 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking how many more 4's are printed than 8's, so the answer should be 91.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe I was overcounting the hundreds place, but no, each page from 400-488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's correct. So, I think the answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me cross-verify with another approach. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately.\n\nCalculating number of 4's:\n\nUnits place: For each 10 pages, one 4. 488 pages have 48 full decades, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus, in the last 8 pages, 481-488, units digit 4 appears once. So, 48+1=49.\n\nTens place: For each 100 pages, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, 10 4's in the tens place. 488 pages have 4 full hundreds, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears from 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 more. So, total tens place 4's:40+10=50.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, 89 pages, each with hundreds digit 4, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nNow, number of 8's:\n\nUnits place: Same as 4's, 49.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 8's in the tens place. 4 full hundreds give 4*10=40. In the last 88 pages, the tens digit 8 appears from 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 more. So, total tens place 8's:40+8=48.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n1. **Units Place Analysis:**\n   - Each set of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n   - 488 pages contain 48 full sets of 10, contributing 48 each.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one 4 and one 8.\n   - Total 4's in units place: 49\n   - Total 8's in units place: 49\n\n2. **Tens Place Analysis:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - 4 full hundreds contribute 40 each.\n   - The last 88 pages (401-488) add 10 4's (441-450) and 8 8's (481-488).\n   - Total 4's in tens place: 50\n   - Total 8's in tens place: 48\n\n3. **Hundreds Place Analysis:**\n   - Pages 400-488 contribute 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n   - No 8's appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's in hundreds place: 89\n   - Total 8's in hundreds place: 0\n\n4. **Summing Up:**\n   - Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - Total 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n   - Difference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Maybe I should look at each digit place separately\u2014like units, tens, hundreds\u2014and count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, the numbers go from 0 to 9 in a repeating cycle. So in every block of 10 pages, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. That means for 488 pages, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra pages.\n\nIn each complete block, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does the digit 8. So for 48 blocks, that's 48 times each. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So in these, the digit 4 appears once (on page 484) and the digit 8 appears once (on page 488). So in the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking how many more 4's than 8's, so maybe they aren't equal. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me double-check. For the units place, each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages. So for 488 pages, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete tens plus any extra in the last partial block. So the number of complete tens is 48 (since 48*10=480), and then from 481 to 488, that's 8 pages, so the units digits go from 1 to 8. So in the units place, 4 appears once in each complete block, so 48 times, plus once in the last partial block (page 484). So total 49 times for 4 in units place. Similarly, 8 appears once in each complete block (48 times) and once in the last partial block (page 488). So 49 times for 8 as well. So in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. So the count for units place is equal for both digits.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages, right? So in each block of 100 pages, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit is 0 for 0-9, 1 for 10-19, up to 9 for 90-99. So each digit appears 10 times in the tens place per 100 pages.\n\nNow, how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 4*100=400, so there are 4 complete hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 88 pages left (400-488). So in each of these four hundreds, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 pages (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 4 appears 4 times 10 = 40 times in the tens place across the four hundreds. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 pages in each hundred, so 4*10=40 times as well.\n\nNow, let's look at the last partial hundred, from 400-488. The tens digit here goes from 0 to 8. So in this block, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? It's from 440-449, which is 10 pages, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 400-488, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place here. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 pages, right? So that's 10 times. But wait, 488 is page 488, so 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, 10 times. So for 4, in the tens place, it's 40 (from the four hundreds) plus 10 in the last partial block, totaling 50 times.\n\nWait, no, hold on. Wait, the last partial block is 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So in the tens place, 4 appears when the tens digit is 4, which is from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. So in the tens place, 4 appears 4*10 (from the four hundreds) plus 10 in the last partial block, totaling 50 times.\n\nNow, what about 8 in the tens place? In the four complete hundreds, each hundred contributes 10 times for 8 in the tens place, so 4*10=40 times. Now, in the last partial block, 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 pages (480 to 488 inclusive). So that's 9 times. So in the tens place, 8 appears 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nSo in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times. So the difference here is 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place?\n\nFor 4, it's from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nFor 8, does 8 appear in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the highest hundreds digit is 4 (for 400-488). So 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So that's 89 more 4's than 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The hundreds digit cycles every 100 pages, so in 1-99, it's 0; 100-199, it's 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4. So yes, 8 never appears in the hundreds place because 800 would be beyond 488. So 8's count is zero in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, putting it all together. Let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nWait, but that seems like a big difference. Let me check my calculations again because 188-98=90, which seems a lot, but maybe that's correct.\n\nWait, let me go through each digit place again to confirm.\n\nUnits place:\n- Each 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once in units place.\n- 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1 to 4 and 1 to 8, so 48 each.\n- Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n- So total units: 48+1=49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred, 10 times for each digit in tens place, so 4 appears 10 times per hundred, 8 appears 10 times per hundred.\n- 4 hundreds (0-399), so 4*10=40 each.\n- Then, in 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8.\n- For 4 in tens place: 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times.\n- For 8 in tens place: 480-488, which is 9 pages (since 488 is the last page), so 9 times.\n- So total tens place: 4 appears 40+10=50, 8 appears 40+9=49.\n- So 4 has 50, 8 has 49. So 4 is 1 more in tens place.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n- 8 doesn't appear in hundreds place because 488 is less than 800.\n- So 4:89, 8:0.\n\nAdding them up:\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo 188 - 98 = 90. So 4's appear 90 times more than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, which is a significant number. That must be the main reason for the higher count of 4's. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place.\n\nYes, pages 400-488 are 89 pages, each with 4 in the hundreds place. So 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So that's correct.\n\nSo, yes, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that makes sense. I don't see any errors in the calculations now. So the final answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total complete blocks of 10 in 488 pages: 48 (480 pages).\n   - Remaining pages: 481-488 (8 pages).\n   - Count of '4's: 48 (from blocks) + 1 (page 484) = 49.\n   - Count of '8's: 48 (from blocks) + 1 (page 488) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Complete hundreds: 4 (400 pages), contributing 40 each.\n   - Remaining pages: 400-488 (89 pages).\n   - '4's: 10 times (440-449).\n   - '8's: 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total '4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total '8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - '4' appears in 400-488: 89 times.\n   - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total '4's: 89.\n   - Total '8's: 0.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should look at each digit place separately\u2014units, tens, hundreds\u2014and count the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every 10 pages, the digits 0 through 9 each appear once in the units place. So, from page 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets and then 8 more pages (481 to 488). In each complete set, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for 48 sets, that's 48 times each. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1 through 8. So, in this partial set, 8 appears once, and 4 doesn't appear because 484 would be the next one, but 484 is beyond 488. Wait, no, 484 is within 488, right? Wait, 484 is page 484, which is less than 488. So, actually, in the last partial set, the units digits go up to 8, so 4 appears once at 484 and 8 appears once at 488. So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 times (from the complete sets) plus 1 (from 484), totaling 49 times. 8 appears 48 times plus 1, so 49 times as well. Wait, but 488 is included, so 8 appears once more, making it 49 times for 8. Hmm, but wait, 488 is the last page, so yes, that's correct. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. For each complete set of 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, 48 complete sets would give 48 each. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, units place: 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, in the units place, they are equal.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. In each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. Now, the book has 488 pages, so that's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). Wait, no, actually, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So, each hundred contributes 10 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place. Now, the remaining 88 pages (401-488) have their tens digits from 0 to 8. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 and 8 appear?\n\nWait, from 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. Let's see: pages 401-410 have tens digit 0, 411-420 have 1, 421-430 have 2, 431-440 have 3, 441-450 have 4, 451-460 have 5, 461-470 have 6, 471-480 have 7, and 481-488 have 8. So, in the tens place, 4 appears once from 441-450 (10 pages), so that's 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears once from 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, that's 8 pages. So, does that mean 8 appears 8 times in the tens place? Wait, no, because the tens digit is 8 for all pages from 480-488, but 480 is included in the 401-488 range. Wait, 480 is page 480, which is within 401-488. So, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8, which is 9 pages (480-488 inclusive). Wait, no, 480 is the first page with tens digit 8, and 488 is the last. So, how many pages have tens digit 8 in 401-488? It's from 480-488, which is 9 pages (480, 481,...,488). So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages, each contributing one 8. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). Therefore, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times in the last partial hundred.\n\nSo, overall, in the tens place, 4 appears 4*10 + 10 = 50 times, and 8 appears 4*10 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, each full hundred contributes 10 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10 = 40 times each. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), 4 appears 10 times (from 441-450) and 8 appears 9 times (from 480-488). So, total in tens place: 4 appears 40 + 10 = 50 times, and 8 appears 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I'm counting correctly. Let me think again. Each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10=40 each. Now, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 40 + 10 = 50 times, and 8 appears 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. So, 4 is ahead by 1 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case, since the book has 488 pages. So, from page 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0 (since it's a three-digit number starting at 100, but page 1 is just 1, so maybe I should consider it as 001? Wait, no, page numbers are 1-488, so from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, but we don't print leading zeros, so maybe the hundreds digit doesn't exist for pages 1-99. Wait, but when considering digits, page 1 is just '1', so it's a single digit, page 10 is '10', so two digits, and pages 100 onwards are three digits. So, in the hundreds place, pages 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit, so the hundreds digit is 0 for those. Pages 100-199 have hundreds digit 1, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, 4 is ahead by 89 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nUnits place:\n- 4: 49 times\n- 8: 49 times\n\nTens place:\n- 4: 50 times\n- 8: 49 times\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4: 89 times\n- 8: 0 times\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, 4's are printed 188 - 98 = 90 times more than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place:\n- Each 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once in units.\n- 488 pages: 48 full tens, and 8 extra pages (481-488).\n- So, 48*1 = 48 for each, plus in the last 8 pages, 4 appears at 484, and 8 appears at 488. So, 49 each.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred, 10 times each for 4 and 8 in tens place.\n- 4 hundreds: 4*10 = 40 each.\n- Last 88 pages (401-488): 4 appears in 441-450 (10 times), and 8 appears in 480-488 (9 times).\n- So, 40 +10=50 for 4, 40 +9=49 for 8.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 400-488: 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times.\n- 8 never appears in hundreds place.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89= 188\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98\nDifference: 188-98=90\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 4's are printed 90 times more than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place.\n   - 488 pages have 48 full sets of 10 and 8 extra pages (481-488).\n   - In full sets: 48 times each.\n   - In the last 8 pages: 4 appears once (484), 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total: 49 each.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place.\n   - 4 hundreds contribute 40 times each.\n   - Last 88 pages (401-488):\n     - 4 appears 10 times (441-450).\n     - 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total: 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place: 89 times.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 times for 4, 0 for 8.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should look at each digit place separately\u2014like units, tens, hundreds\u2014and count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place. That makes sense because each digit contributes to the total count.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 pages, the digits 0 through 9 each appear once in the units place. So, from page 1 to page 488, how many full groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're dealing with full groups, it's 48 full groups. So, in each of these 48 groups, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same for 8. So that would be 48 times each. But wait, after 480, there are 8 more pages: 481 to 488. In the units place of these, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, adding that, the units place contributes 49 fours and 49 eights? Wait, no, because from 1 to 480, it's 48 times each, and then 481-488 adds one more each. So total units place: 49 fours and 49 eights. Hmm, but wait, 480 is the last full group, so 480 is included in the 48 groups. Then 481 to 488 is 8 pages, so the units digits go from 1 to 8. So 484 has a 4 in the units place, and 488 has an 8. So yes, units place gives 49 fours and 49 eights.\n\nNext, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. So, for example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. Wait, no, actually, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for every 100 pages. So, for 488 pages, how many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each hundred contributes 10 times each digit in the tens place. So, for each hundred, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10 = 40 fours and 40 eights in the tens place. But wait, after 400, we have pages 401 to 488. So, in the 400s, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. Let's see: from 401-410, tens digit is 0; 411-420, it's 1; and so on up to 481-490, which would be tens digit 8, but wait, our book only goes up to 488. So, the tens digits in 401-488 go from 0 to 8, but not all digits are fully represented. Let's see: how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place from 401 to 488?\n\nWait, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles as follows:\n- 401-410: tens digit 0\n- 411-420: tens digit 1\n- 421-430: tens digit 2\n- 431-440: tens digit 3\n- 441-450: tens digit 4\n- 451-460: tens digit 5\n- 461-470: tens digit 6\n- 471-480: tens digit 7\n- 481-488: tens digit 8\n\nSo, in the tens place from 401-488, the digit 4 appears once in 441-450, which is 10 times (441 to 450). Similarly, the digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so the tens digit 8 appears 8 times? Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 for all those pages, so from 481-488, the tens digit is 8, which is 8 pages. So, in the 400s, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and the tens digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, in the tens place, from 1-488, we have 40 fours (from the first 4 hundreds) plus 10 more fours in 441-450, making it 50 fours. Similarly, for 8s, we have 40 eights from the first 4 hundreds plus 8 eights in 481-488, making it 48 eights. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me clarify.\n\nActually, in the first 400 pages (1-400), the tens digit cycles 4 times, each digit 0-9 appearing 40 times in the tens place. So, 4 and 8 each appear 40 times in the tens place from 1-400. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit goes through 0-8, as I listed before. So, in the tens place from 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, total tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 fours, and 40 + 8 = 48 eights.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Because from 1-400, each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, as I listed, so 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 8 times. So, total fours in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, and eights: 40 + 8 = 48. So, in the tens place, fours are 50 and eights are 48. That seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, in the hundreds place, how many times does 4 appear? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. How about 8? The hundreds digit never reaches 8 in a 488-page book, right? Because the hundreds digit goes up to 4 (400-488). So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: fours = 89, eights = 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n- Fours: 49\n- Eights: 49\n\nTens place:\n- Fours: 50\n- Eights: 48\n\nHundreds place:\n- Fours: 89\n- Eights: 0\n\nSo, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nSo, the number of fours printed is 188, and the number of eights is 97. The difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nFirst, units place: from 1-488, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the units digit?\n\nEvery 10 pages, each digit 0-9 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 and one 8. That's 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units: 48 + 1 = 49 fours, 48 + 1 = 49 eights. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: from 1-400, each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place. So, 40 fours and 40 eights. Then, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Let's count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit cycles every 10 pages. So, for the tens digit 4, it's from 441-450, which is 10 pages. So, 10 fours. For the tens digit 8, it's from 481-490, but our book ends at 488, so only 8 pages: 481-488. So, 8 eights. So, total tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 fours, 40 + 8 = 48 eights. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: from 1-399, hundreds digit is 1,2,3. From 400-488, hundreds digit is 4. So, 4 appears 89 times (400-488 inclusive). 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only has 488 pages. So, hundreds place: 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\nAdding them up:\nFours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188\nEights: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49+48=97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For example, in the units place, I considered 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8, and then the remaining 8 pages contributing one each. That seems right.\n\nIn the tens place, from 1-400, 40 fours and 40 eights. Then from 401-488, 10 fours and 8 eights. So, 50 fours and 48 eights.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 89 fours and 0 eights.\n\nAdding up: 49+50+89=188 fours, 49+48+0=97 eights.\n\nSo, 188 - 97 = 91. So, 91 more fours than eights.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning.\n</think>\n\nThe problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately:\n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - From 1 to 488, each digit 0-9 appears in the units place every 10 pages.\n   - There are 48 full groups of 10, contributing 48 fours and 48 eights.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one more 4 and one more 8.\n   - Total: 49 fours, 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - From 1 to 400, each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place.\n   - From 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8:\n     - 4 appears 10 times (441-450).\n     - 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n   - Total: 50 fours, 48 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - From 1-399, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3.\n   - From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\n**Total Counts**:\n- Fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- Eights: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference**: 188 fours - 97 eights = 91 more fours.\n\n**Answer**: The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 91.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Maybe I should look at the digits in the units place and the tens place separately. Let me start by considering how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nLet me think, in a book with pages from 1 to 488, each page number is either one, two, or three digits long. So, I need to count the number of times the digit 4 appears in the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place, and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 appears once. Now, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete sets of ten and then an extra 8 pages. In each complete set, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place, so that's 48 times each. Now, for the extra 8 pages, which are from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (at 484), and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but that seems like they are equal, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. From 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of ten, so 48 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1 to 8. So, 484 has a 4 in the units place, and 488 has an 8. So yes, 4 appears once and 8 appears once in the units place for the extra 8 pages. So total units place: 48 +1 = 49 for 4, and same for 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8.\n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). So, for each of the first four hundreds, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. That's 4*10 = 40 times for 4 and 40 times for 8.\n\nNow, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. The tens digit is 4 for pages 440-449, which is 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is only 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here. Wait, is that right? Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the 401-488 range. Similarly, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in 440-449.\n\nSo, in the 401-488 range, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 9 times. Therefore, total for the tens place: 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 10 = 50 times for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 times for 8.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is either 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up all the occurrences:\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting again, units place: 4 appears 49 times, 8 appears 49 times. Tens place: 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times. Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Total 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit for 4 is 10 times (440-449) and for 8 it's 9 times (480-488). So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place: Each set of 10 pages gives one 4 and one 8. 488 pages mean 48 full sets of 10, giving 48 each, and then 8 extra pages (481-488). In these, 484 has a 4, and 488 has an 8. So, 48 +1 =49 for both. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98.\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I feel like that's a lot, but maybe it's correct. Let me see: 4 appears more in the hundreds place, which makes sense because 4 is the hundreds digit for a large chunk of the book. So, yeah, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place Analysis:**\n   - Each set of 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) contains exactly one '4' and one '8' in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 480 pages (48 \u00d7 10 = 480), contributing 48 '4's and 48 '8's.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) include one '4' (484) and one '8' (488).\n   - **Total in units place:** 49 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place Analysis:**\n   - Each set of 100 consecutive numbers has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n   - For the first 400 pages (4 hundreds), each digit appears 10 times per hundred, totaling 40 '4's and 40 '8's.\n   - In the range 401-488, the tens digit '4' appears 10 times (440-449), and '8' appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - **Total in tens place:** 50 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place Analysis:**\n   - The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n   - The digit '8' never appears in the hundreds place in this range.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 89 '4's and 0 '8's.\n\n4. **Total Occurrences:**\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total '8's from the total '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8'.  \nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Maybe I should look at each digit place separately, like units, tens, and hundreds, because the occurrence of digits can vary in each place.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every 10 pages, the digits 0 through 9 each appear once in the units place. So, for example, pages 1-10 have 1 each of 0-9, pages 11-20 have the same, and so on. Since the book has 488 pages, the units place cycles every 10 pages. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra pages (481 to 488).\n\nIn each complete set of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears once. So, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 times 1, which is 48, plus any additional 4's in the extra 8 pages. Wait, the extra pages are from 481 to 488, so in the units place, those are 1 to 8. So, does that include a 4? Yes, page 484 would have a 4 in the units place. So, that adds one more 4, making the total 4's in the units place 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, for 8's, in the extra 8 pages, the units digit 8 appears once on page 488. So, the 8's in the units place would be 48 times 1 plus 1, which is 49 as well.\n\nWait, but that seems like both 4's and 8's have the same count in the units place. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. Each set of 10 has one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 sets give 48 each. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have a 4 in the units place on 484, and an 8 on 488. So, 4's units: 48 +1=49, 8's units: 48 +1=49. So, same count. So, the difference in units place is zero.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each group of 100 pages has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, pages 1-100: the tens digit goes from 0 (pages 1-9) to 9 (pages 91-100). So, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place over 100 pages.\n\nSo, for the tens place, the digit 4 would appear 10 times every 100 pages, and similarly, 8 would appear 10 times every 100 pages. Now, how many complete hundreds are in 488 pages? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 4 times 10 is 40. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times in each hundred, so 4 times 10 is 40. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 481-488). So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 occurrences. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488), but wait, 480 is page 480, which is within 401-488. Wait, but 480 is actually in the hundreds place, right? Wait, no, 480 is page 480, so the tens digit is 8, and the units digit is 0. So, from 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for all these pages. That's 9 pages (480-488 inclusive), but wait, 480 is included, so that's 9 pages. But wait, 480 is page 480, so from 480 to 488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier, in each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times, but in the last partial hundred, we only have 9. So, for the tens place, the total 4's would be 40 (from the complete hundreds) plus 10 (from 440-449), totaling 50. The 8's would be 40 (from the complete hundreds) plus 9 (from 480-488), totaling 49. So, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times, so the difference here is 1 more 4 than 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. Wait, but page 1 is 001, but the hundreds digit is 0, but in reality, page numbers don't have leading zeros, so the hundreds digit is only present when the page number is 100 or above. So, for pages 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's not printed. So, the hundreds digit is only printed for pages 100-488.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit cycles every 1000, but in our case, up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 1 from 100-199 (100 times), 2 from 200-299 (100 times), 3 from 300-399 (100 times), and 4 from 400-488 (89 times, since 488-400+1=89). So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4 at maximum, not 8. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nSo, adding up all the occurrences:\n\n- Units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49\n- Tens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 49\n- Hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, that can't be right because 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188, and 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again, because I might have made a mistake in the tens place.\n\nWait, in the tens place, I had 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's, so 4*10=40 each. Then, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, so 4's tens = 40+10=50. For 8's tens, in the last 88 pages, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 times, so 8's tens = 40+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 doesn't appear at all, so 89-0=89.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I should include the hundreds place for all pages. Let me think again. Pages 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit, so they don't contribute any 4's or 8's in the hundreds place. Pages 100-488 do have a hundreds digit. So, for 100-199, hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's there. For 200-299, hundreds digit is 2, same. 300-399, hundreds digit is 3. 400-488, hundreds digit is 4. So, the only hundreds digit that's 4 is from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, that part seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the units place, I had 488 pages, so for units digits, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see, every 10 pages, 4 appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once on 484. So, total 4's in units place: 48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus one more on 488, so 49.\n\nSo, units place: 49 each.\n\nTens place: 4's: 40 (from 4 hundreds) +10 (from 440-449) =50\n\n8's: 40 +9=49\n\nHundreds place: 4's:89, 8's:0\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 4's, but in the tens place, 440-449 is 10 pages, so that's correct. Hmm.\n\nWait, but another way to check: let's count how many times 4 appears in each position.\n\nUnits digit: 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus the extra 8 pages, which include 484, so one more, total 49.\n\nTens digit: 488 /100=4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 40. Then, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 more, total 50.\n\nHundreds digit: only in 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits digit: same as 4's, 49.\n\nTens digit: 488 /100=4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 40. Then, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 more, total 49.\n\nHundreds digit: 0, since the hundreds digit doesn't reach 8.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I should include the hundreds place for 4's. Let me think again: pages 400-488 have the hundreds digit as 4, so that's 89 pages, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me check another approach to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nAnother way is to iterate through each digit position and count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nStarting with the units digit:\n\nFor units digit, as before, 488 pages, so 48 full cycles of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) contribute one 4 and one 8. So, units digit: 4's=49, 8's=49.\n\nTens digit:\n\nEach hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 full hundreds (1-400) contribute 4*10=40 4's and 40 8's. Then, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. The 4 in the tens place occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 more 4's. The 8 in the tens place occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 more 8's. So, tens digit: 4's=40+10=50, 8's=40+9=49.\n\nHundreds digit:\n\nOnly in 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's. No 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to 8's. \n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each set of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488 pages, contributing 48 each.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - Total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n   - There are 4 complete hundreds (1-400), contributing 40 each.\n   - In the remaining 88 pages (401-488), 440-449 adds 10 more 4's, and 480-488 adds 9 more 8's.\n   - Total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have the hundreds digit as 4, contributing 89 4's.\n   - No 8's appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n   - Total 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should look at each digit place separately, like units, tens, hundreds, and see how often 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every set of ten pages, like 1-10, 11-20, and so on, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 also appears once. So, if I calculate how many full sets of ten are there in 488 pages, I can find out how many times 4 and 8 appear in the units place.\n\nWait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of ten and then 8 extra pages (481-488). So, in each full set, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, for 48 sets, that would be 48 times each. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total for units place: 48 + 1 = 49 times for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 times for 8. Hmm, so in units place, they're equal.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit changes every ten pages. So, for example, from 1-9, the tens digit is 0, then 10-19 it's 1, and so on. So, each digit from 0 to 9 appears in the tens place for exactly 10 consecutive pages. So, for the digit 4, how many times does it appear in the tens place?\n\nWell, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is a full set, but what about 480-489? Wait, 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is only 9 pages. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49 (10 times), 140-149 (10 times), 240-249 (10 times), 340-349 (10 times), and 440-449 (10 times). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 pages. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 times, so 5*10=50 times for 4 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check. 40-49: 10 pages, 4 in tens place. Then 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 times 10, which is 50. So, 4 appears 50 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, what about 8 in the tens place? The tens digit 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 80-89: 10 pages, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 pages. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, so in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. So, so far, 4 is ahead by 1 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit changes every 100 pages. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0. Then 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, 200-299: 2, 300-399:3, and 400-488:4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 pages because 488 - 400 +1 =89. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up the hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times. So, 4 is ahead by 89 here.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 times. 800-899 would be beyond our book, so no 8's in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nNow, is there a thousands place? Since the book is 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488, so the thousands digit is 0 for all pages. So, no 4's or 8's in the thousands place.\n\nSo, now, let's sum up the counts for each digit.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's = 49 +50 +89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's =49 +49 +0=98\n\nWait, so 4's total is 188, 8's total is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- Each ten pages, 4 and 8 each appear once. So, 48 full tens (480 pages) give 48 each. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48+1=49 for 4, same for 8.\n\nTens place:\n- For 4: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, 10 each, so 50.\n- For 8: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n- For 4: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n- For 8: 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n- 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought 4's would be more, but 90 seems a bit high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Wait, 400-488 is 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, for 8, I had 480-488 as 9 pages. Wait, 480-488 is 9 pages: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, 9 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for each of these, so 9 times, correct.\n\nSo, for 8 in the tens place: 10 (80-89) +10 (180-189) +10 (280-289) +10 (380-389) +9 (480-488) =49.\n\nWait, so 4's tens place is 50, 8's is 49.\n\nWait, so 4's total is 49+50+89=188, 8's is 49+49+0=98. So, difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because I thought maybe I missed something. Let me try another approach: calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position separately.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: In each 10 pages, there's one 4. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1-8, so 4 appears once (484). So, total 48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's: same logic, 48 full sets, 48, and in the last partial set, 8 appears once (488). So, 48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: Each 100 pages, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for 488 pages, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nIt's the number of times the tens digit is 4. That occurs in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 pages, so 5 ranges, 10 each: 5*10=50.\n\nNumber of 8's in the tens place: Similarly, the ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges have 10 pages each, contributing 4*10=40. The last range, 480-488, has 9 pages, so 9. So total 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: The hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488. So, 488-400+1=89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nNumber of 8's: The hundreds digit is 8 from page 800 onwards, but our book ends at 488, so 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nHmm, so I think that's correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each set of 10 pages (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) contains one '4' and one '8' in the units place.\n   - There are 48 full sets of 10 in 488 pages, contributing 48 each.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one '4' (484) and one '8' (488).\n   - **Total 4's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n   - **Total 8's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each set of 100 pages has 10 occurrences of '4' and '8' in the tens place.\n   - '4' appears in the tens place in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 (10 each), totaling 50.\n   - '8' appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 (9 pages), totaling 49.\n   - **Total 4's in tens place:** 50\n   - **Total 8's in tens place:** 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - '4' appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages.\n   - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 4's in hundreds place:** 89\n   - **Total 8's in hundreds place:** 0\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should look at the digits in the units place and the tens place separately. \n\nLet me start by thinking about the units place. For every set of ten pages, like 1-10, 11-20, and so on, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, in 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So each digit 0-9 appears once every ten pages. \n\nNow, how many times does the digit 4 appear in the units place? Well, from 1 to 488, how many tens are there? Let me calculate that. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets of ten and then 8 extra pages. Each full set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial set from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So the digit 4 appears once more in 484. So total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, each set of ten has one 8. So again, 48 sets give 48 eights, and in the last partial set, 488 is included, so the units digit is 8 once more. So total 8's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking how many more 4's than 8's, so maybe I'm missing something. Maybe I should also check the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, the digit 4 appears in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the ranges are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So 5*10=50 4's in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place, the ranges would be 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the range. So that's 5 ranges as well. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, etc.) contribute 10 8's, but the last one, 480-488, contributes only 9 8's because it stops at 488. So that's 10*4 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me make sure. For 80-89, that's 10 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers. So yes, 4*10 + 9=49.\n\nSo total 4's would be units place 49 + tens place 50 = 99.\n\nTotal 8's would be units place 49 + tens place 49 = 98.\n\nSo the difference is 99 - 98 = 1. So there is one more 4 than 8.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to miscount.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor 4's: Each ten has one 4, so 48 full tens give 48, and the last 8 pages (481-488) include 484, so one more. Total 49.\n\nFor 8's: Similarly, each ten has one 8, 48 tens give 48, and the last partial ten includes 488, so one more. Total 49.\n\nTens place for 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each gives 10, so 5*10=50.\n\nTens place for 8's: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four ranges give 10 each, so 4*10=40, and the last range 480-488 gives 9, so 40+9=49.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nDifference: 99 - 98 = 1.\n\nSo the answer should be 1 more 4 than 8.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check again. The last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So the tens digit is 8 for all these, right? Because 480 is 4 8 0, so tens digit is 8. So from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So yes, 9.\n\nSo yes, 4*10 +9=49 for 8's in tens place.\n\nTherefore, total 4's: 99, 8's:98, difference 1.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n1. **Counting 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** Each set of ten pages (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) has exactly one 4 in the units place. There are 48 full sets of ten (480 pages) contributing 48 fours. The remaining 8 pages (481-488) include 484, adding one more 4. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens place:** The ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449 each contribute 10 fours. Total: 50.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99.\n\n2. **Counting 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to 4's, each set of ten contributes one 8, totaling 48. The last partial set includes 488, adding one more. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens place:** The ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 each contribute 10 eights. The range 480-488 contributes 9 eights. Total: 49.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 99 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 1.\n\n$\\boxed{1}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should look at each digit place separately\u2014units, tens, hundreds\u2014since each place can contribute to the count of 4's and 8's.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every set of ten pages, like 1-10, 11-20, and so on, the digit in the units place cycles through 0 to 9. So in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. So for the units place, the number of 4's and 8's should be the same, right? But wait, since the book has 488 pages, the last set might not be complete. Let me check.\n\n488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten and then 8 more pages. So in the units place, from 1 to 488, how many 4's and 8's do we have? Each complete set of ten (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So 48 sets would give 48 4's and 48 8's. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So in this partial set, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So here, we have one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So adding that, the total for units place would be 48 +1 = 49 4's and 48 +1 =49 8's. Wait, but that would mean the units place has equal numbers of 4's and 8's. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, no, because in the last partial set, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so yes, 4 and 8 each appear once. So units place contributes 49 each. So 49 4's and 49 8's from units place. Okay, moving on to the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every hundred pages. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), then 1 (10-19), up to 9 (90-99). So in each hundred, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So for 488 pages, how many hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). Wait, no, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages, so actually, it's 4 full hundreds plus 88 pages, which is 400 + 88 = 488. So in each of these 4 hundreds, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly for 8, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. So in each hundred, 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 4's and 4*10=40 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, what about the last 88 pages, from 401 to 488? Let me see, the tens digit here goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the tens digit in 480-488 is 8. So in the tens place, from 401 to 488, how many times does 4 appear? Well, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, up to 8 for 480-488. So in the tens place, 4 appears in 401-410 as 0, so no 4's there. Wait, no, the tens digit is 0, so it's not 4. So in the tens place from 401-488, does 4 appear at all? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, 440-449 would be in the 400s, but we're only going up to 488, so 440-449 is included. So in 440-449, the tens digit is 4, so that's 10 times. So in the tens place from 401-488, how many 4's? It's 10 times in 440-449, right? Because 440-449 is within 401-488. So that's 10 4's in the tens place. What about 8's? The tens digit is 8 in 480-488, so that's 9 pages (480-488), but since each ten has 10 pages, it's 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. Wait, 480 is the first page with tens digit 8, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for each, so that's 9 times 8 in the tens place. Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 pages, but we only go up to 488, so it's 9 pages. So in the tens place from 401-488, we have 10 4's and 9 8's.\n\nSo adding that to the earlier 40 4's and 40 8's from the first 400 pages, the total in the tens place would be 40 +10=50 4's and 40 +9=49 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I did that correctly. Let me double-check. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 hundreds give 40 each. Then from 401-488, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So yes, that's correct. So total tens place: 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 for pages 1-488. So in the hundreds place, how often does 4 appear? Well, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 pages (400-488). So that's 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. How about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So in the hundreds place, we have 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the digits.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my calculations again because 188 - 98 would mean 90 more 4's than 8's, but I think I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me recalculate the units place first. From 1 to 488, how many 4's and 8's in the units place. Each ten has one 4 and one 8. So 488 divided by 10 is 48 full tens and 8 extra pages. So 48 tens give 48 4's and 48 8's. Then in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once. So total units place: 48 +1=49 4's and 48 +1=49 8's. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: From 1-400, each hundred has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 hundreds give 40 each. Then from 401-488, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So total tens place: 50 4's and 49 8's. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 doesn't appear at all. So 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo 188 - 98 = 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm not sure if I counted the hundreds place correctly. Let me check again.\n\nWait, from 400-488, that's 89 pages, right? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these 89 pages, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nAnd for 8's in the hundreds place, since 800 is beyond 488, there are none. So 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 +50 +89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 +49 +0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98 =90.\n\nWait, but I'm getting 90 more 4's than 8's. But I'm not sure if that's correct because sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately and sum them up.\n\nFor units place:\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) + (if the last digit is >=4, add 1). Wait, no, actually, for units place, each digit from 0-9 appears equally in each position except possibly the last partial set.\n\nWait, maybe a better way is to calculate how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nIn the units place, the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to N is floor((N +10 -d)/10). Wait, maybe that's too formulaic. Alternatively, for each position, the count can be calculated as follows.\n\nFor units place:\nNumber of 4's = number of complete tens *1 + extra if the last number's units digit is >=4.\n\nWait, 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 complete tens, each contributing one 4. Then, in the last partial ten (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, which is >=4, so we add 1 more 4. So total 4's in units place: 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: same logic, 48 +1=49.\n\nIn tens place:\nNumber of 4's: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes up to 8. So in 401-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's from 440-449, which is 10 times. So total 4's in tens place:40 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place: in each hundred, 10 times. So 4*10=40. Then in 401-488, 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 times. So total 8's in tens place:40 +9=49.\n\nIn hundreds place:\nNumber of 4's: From 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNumber of 8's: Since 800-899 is beyond 488, so 0.\n\nSo adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188.\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so that's consistent with my earlier calculation. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when I count digits, especially in higher places, I might miss something. Let me try to think differently. Maybe I can write a small program or use another method to verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each position again.\n\nUnits place:\nFrom 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So total number of 4's in units place is floor(488/10)=48, plus if the last digit is >=4, which it is (8>=4), so add 1. So 49.\n\nSame for 8's: floor(488/10)=48, and since last digit is 8>=8, add 1. So 49.\n\nTens place:\nEach ten has one 4 and one 8 in the tens place, but over 100 numbers, it's 10 times each. So for 488, which is 4 hundreds and 88 pages, so in the tens place, for each hundred, 10 times each. So 4*10=40 for 4's and 4*10=40 for 8's.\n\nThen, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So for 4's in tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 4's. For 8's, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 8's.\n\nSo total tens place: 40+10=50 4's and 40+9=49 8's.\n\nHundreds place:\nFrom 1-399, hundreds digit is 1,2,3, so no 4's or 8's. From 400-488, hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's. 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So I think the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total complete sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 sets, contributing 48 4's and 48 8's.\n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) add 1 more 4 and 1 more 8.\n   - Total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in each hundred.\n   - For 400 pages, 4 hundreds contribute 10 4's and 10 8's each, totaling 40 each.\n   - From 401-488:\n     - 4's in tens place: 10 times (440-449).\n     - 8's in tens place: 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times.\n   - 8's in hundreds place: 0 (since 800+ is beyond 488).\n   - Total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n   - Total 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - Total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should look at each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds, and maybe thousands? Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488, so the thousands place would only be relevant if there are any page numbers in the thousands, which there aren't. So, I can probably ignore the thousands place.\n\nAlright, so I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each place (units, tens, hundreds) and then do the same for the digit 8. Then, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For every set of ten pages (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place, right? Similarly, the digit 8 also appears once in each set of ten. So, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra pages (481-488). In each complete set, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place, so that's 48 times each. Now, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial set, the digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). So, total units place counts: 4's = 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's = 48 + 1 = 49. So, they're equal in the units place. That's interesting.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. In the tens place, the digit changes every ten pages. So, for example, from 1-10, the tens digit is 0 or 1, but in the tens place, it's 0 for 1-9 and 1 for 10. Wait, no, actually, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, and so on. So, each digit from 0 to 9 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, it appears from 40-49, which is ten times. Similarly, the digit 8 in the tens place appears from 80-89, which is ten times. Now, how many complete sets of 100 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are four complete sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each complete set of 100, the digit 4 appears ten times in the tens place (40-49), and the digit 8 appears ten times in the tens place (80-89). So, for four complete sets, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times for 4's and 40 times for 8's. Now, in the partial set from 401-488, we need to check if the tens digit is 4 or 8. The tens digit in this range is 0 (401-409), 1 (410-419), 2 (420-429), 3 (430-439), 4 (440-449), 5 (450-459), 6 (460-469), 7 (470-479), 8 (480-488). Wait, actually, let's check that. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-409), 1 (410-419), up to 8 (480-488). So, in this partial set, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is ten pages, and 8 for 480-488, which is nine pages because 488 is the last page. Wait, 480-489 would be ten pages, but since we only go up to 488, it's nine pages. So, in the tens place, 4 appears ten times (440-449) and 8 appears nine times (480-488). \n\nTherefore, in the tens place, the total counts are: 4's = 40 (from complete sets) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50, and 8's = 40 (from complete sets) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49. So, in the tens place, 4's are more than 8's by 1.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only has 488 pages, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, in the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times, and 8's appear 0 times.\n\nWait, but actually, let me double-check that. The hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages. So, each of those pages has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. 8's in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 8's count is 0.\n\nSo, summarizing the hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0.\n\nNow, let's add up the counts for each digit across all places.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate that. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nNow for 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place: 48 complete sets of ten, each contributing one 4 and one 8, plus one each in the last partial set (481-488, which includes 484 and 488). So, 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4's and 8's. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each complete set of 100 has ten 4's and ten 8's in the tens place. Four complete sets give 40 each. Then, in the partial set (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 440-449 (ten times) and 8 for 480-488 (nine times). So, 4's get 10 more, making 50, and 8's get 9, making 49. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4's appear 89 times (400-488), and 8's don't appear at all. So, 89 for 4's, 0 for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nAdding them up: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 for 4's, and 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 for 8's. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. That's correct.\n\nAnd in the tens place, for 480-488, that's nine pages (480,481,...,488), so nine 8's in the tens place. So, 49 in total for 8's in the tens place. Wait, but in the tens place, the four complete sets give 40, plus nine in the partial set, so 49. That's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in the units place, both 4's and 8's were equal, but in the tens place, 4's are more by one, and in the hundreds place, 4's are way more. So, overall, 4's are more by 90. That seems plausible.\n\nBut let me think of another approach to confirm. Maybe I can calculate the total number of 4's and 8's separately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a formula or a more systematic approach.\n\nFor each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nNumber of 4's in units place = floor(488 / 10) * 1 + min(max(488 % 10 - 4 + 1, 0), 1). Wait, maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, as I did before, for each complete set of ten, there's one 4 and one 8. So, 48 complete sets give 48 each. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), check how many 4's and 8's are in the units place. 484 has a 4, and 488 has an 8. So, one each. So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4's, same for 8's.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach complete set of 100 has ten 4's and ten 8's in the tens place. So, four complete sets give 40 each. Then, in the partial set (401-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So, for 4 in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is ten pages. For 8 in the tens place, it's 480-488, which is nine pages. So, 4's get ten more, 8's get nine. So, total tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's. 8's don't appear here.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each set of ten pages (e.g., 1-10) contains one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of ten in 480 pages, contributing 48 each.\n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) add one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - **Total:** 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each set of 100 pages contains ten 4's and ten 8's in the tens place.\n   - Four complete sets (1-400) contribute 40 each.\n   - The partial set (401-488) adds ten 4's (440-449) and nine 8's (480-488).\n   - **Total:** 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, totaling 89 times.\n   - There are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total:** 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should look at the digits in the units place and the tens place separately.\n\nLet me start by considering the units digit. For every set of ten pages, like 1-10, 11-20, and so on, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, right? For example, in 1-10, it's page 4, then in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once in each set of ten, like page 8, 18, 28, etc.\n\nSo, if I calculate how many complete sets of ten there are in 488 pages, I can figure out how many times 4 and 8 appear in the units place. The number of complete tens in 488 is 48 because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of ten. But wait, I think I should actually consider 488 as 488 pages, so the last page is 488. So, from 1 to 488, how many tens are there?\n\nActually, from 1 to 488, the number of complete tens is 48 because 48*10 = 480, and then there are 8 more pages (481-488). So, in each of these 48 complete tens, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Similarly, 8 appears once in each ten, so that's also 48 times. But wait, in the last partial set from 481-488, we have pages 481 to 488, so the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial set, 4 appears once (page 484) and 8 appears once (page 488). So, in total, for the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. Hmm, so they're equal in the units place.\n\nNow, I need to check the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 pages (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears in the tens place for 10 pages (80-89). \n\nLet me calculate how many hundreds are in 488 pages. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these hundreds has 10 pages where the tens digit is 4 and 10 pages where it's 8. So, for each hundred, that's 10 times each. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 times for 4's in the tens place and 40 times for 8's in the tens place.\n\nBut wait, after page 400, we have pages 401-488. So, in the 400s, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, from 400-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490, but wait, 488 is the end, so actually, the tens digit in 400-488 goes up to 8, but only up to 488. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for pages 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, that's another 10 times for 4's in the tens place. Similarly, the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-488, but wait, 480-489 would be 10 pages, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 9 pages (480-488). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in the 400-488 range.\n\nSo, adding that up, in the tens place, 4 appears 40 (from the first 4 hundreds) + 10 (from 400-449) = 50 times. And 8 appears 40 (from the first 4 hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49 times. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake here because in the first 4 hundreds, each hundred contributes 10 times for both 4 and 8 in the tens place, so 4*10=40 for each. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (440-449), so that's 10 more, making it 50 for 4's. For 8's, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-488, which is 9 pages because 488 is the last page. So, 8's in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit is 4 for pages 440-449, which is 10 pages, so that's correct. For 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages because 488 is the end. So, yes, 9 times.\n\nNow, let me sum up the total occurrences for each digit. For 4's, in the units place, we had 49 times, and in the tens place, 50 times. So, total 4's are 49 + 50 = 99 times.\n\nFor 8's, in the units place, we had 49 times, and in the tens place, 49 times. So, total 8's are 49 + 49 = 98 times.\n\nWait, but that would mean there's 99 4's and 98 8's, so 1 more 4 than 8. But I think I might have made a mistake because I remember that in the tens place, the 8's in the 400-488 range are 9 pages, but maybe I should consider if the 8's in the tens place are only 9, but perhaps I missed something else.\n\nWait, let me go back. The first 4 hundreds (1-400) each have 10 pages where the tens digit is 4 and 10 where it's 8. So, 4*10=40 each. Then, from 401-488, which is 88 pages, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (440-449) and 8 for 9 pages (480-488). So, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nUnits place: 49 for both.\n\nSo, total 4's: 50 + 49 = 99.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 99 - 98 = 1. So, there's one more 4 than 8.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach it differently by counting the number of 4's and 8's separately in each digit place.\n\nStarting with the units digit:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nWell, every 10 pages, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is included, which is another 4. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, units place 8's: same calculation, 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial set, 488 is included, so that's another 8. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, tens place:\n\nFor 4's in the tens place, it's every 100 pages, 10 times each. From 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 pages where the tens digit is 4 (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 4*10=40 times.\n\nThen, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (440-449). So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, from 1-400, it's also 4*10=40 times (80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-488, which is 9 pages because 488 is the last page. So, 9 times.\n\nSo, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nWait, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, so 89 times. But since we're only counting 4's and 8's, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 more 4's. But wait, does the hundreds digit affect the count? Because the problem is about the digit 4 and 8, so yes, we should include the hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, the hundreds digit is 8? Wait, no, because 488 is less than 800, so the hundreds digit only goes up to 4. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times. So, that's another 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but earlier I didn't consider the hundreds place. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier by only considering units and tens. So, I need to include the hundreds place as well.\n\nSo, let's recalculate:\n\nTotal 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89 (from 400-488)\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0 (since the hundreds digit never reaches 8 in 488 pages)\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems quite a lot. Hmm, but I think I might have overcounted because in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times, which is correct because from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages. But I'm not sure if I should include the hundreds digit in the count of 4's and 8's. Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe problem says: \"how many more 4's are printed than 8's?\" So, it's about the digits in all positions, units, tens, and hundreds. So, yes, I should include all digit places.\n\nSo, let's recast the counts:\n\n4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89 (from 400-488)\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me verify each component again.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many 4's? As before, 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus one more in the last partial set (484), so 49.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n\n4's: 400-488, tens digit 4 is from 440-449, which is 10 pages. Plus, in each hundred before that, 10 pages each, so 4*10=40. So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n8's in tens place: in each hundred, 10 pages, so 4*10=40, plus in 400-488, tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so hundreds digit is 4, 89 times.\n\nSo, yes, 4's total: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's total: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but that seems correct. So, the answer would be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought it was 1, but that was without considering the hundreds place. So, I think I made a mistake by not including the hundreds digit initially. So, the correct answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check again because 90 seems like a lot. Let me see: 4's in hundreds place: 89, which is a big chunk. Then, 4's in tens place: 50, and units: 49. So, 89+50+49=188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Units Place:**\n   - Each set of ten pages (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) has exactly one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of ten in 488 pages (488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8).\n   - In each set, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place, contributing 48 each.\n   - The last partial set (481-488) includes 484 (one 4) and 488 (one 8).\n   - **Total in units place:** 4's = 49, 8's = 49.\n\n2. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contains ten pages where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49) and ten where it's 8 (e.g., 80-89).\n   - In the first 400 pages, there are four complete hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 for each.\n   - From 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (440-449) and 8 for 9 pages (480-488).\n   - **Total in tens place:** 4's = 40 + 10 = 50, 8's = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Counting 4's in the Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have the hundreds digit as 4, which occurs 89 times (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 4's = 89, 8's = 0.\n\n4. **Summing Up:**\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n5. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - More 4's than 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Page numbers go from 1 to 488, so each page has a single number, either one, two, or three digits long.\n\nI think the key here is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll go through each place and count the occurrences of 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every set of ten consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit in the units place cycles through 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for 8 (like 8, 18, 28, etc.).\n\nSo, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets and then an extra 8 pages. In each of those 48 sets, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, that's 48 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place.\n\nBut wait, there's also the extra 8 pages from 481 to 488. Let me check how many 4's and 8's are in the units place here. The numbers are 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, adding that to the previous count, units place gives us 49 times for 4 and 49 times for 8. Wait, no, because in the 48 complete sets, it's 48 each, and then in the extra 8 pages, we have one more 4 and one more 8. So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8. So, same count so far.\n\nNext, let's move to the tens place. In the tens place, the digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 times, and 8 in 80-89, also 10 times. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times as well.\n\nHow many complete hundreds are in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an extra 88 pages (401-488). In each of these 4 hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and the same for 8. So, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place from the complete hundreds.\n\nNow, let's look at the extra 88 pages from 401-488. The tens digit in this range goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for the tens digit 4, how many times does it appear? It would be in 440-449, which is 10 times. For the tens digit 8, it's in 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 9 times for 8 in the tens place. Hmm, but wait, 488 is included, so maybe it's 9 times for 8 in the tens place? Wait, 480 is the first, then 481, up to 488, which is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, 9 times for 8 in the tens place in this extra 88 pages.\n\nSo, adding up, for the tens place: 40 (from the complete hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50 times for 4. And for 8, it's 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, 400-488 is part of the 400s, so the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? It's 89 times because every page from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. \n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so the hundreds digit is 4, not 8. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all.\n\nSo, summarizing the hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let me add up all the occurrences of 4 and 8 across units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with 4:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4 appears 188 times.\n\nNow for 8:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n- Each ten has one 4 and one 8.\n- 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each.\n- Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have one 4 (484) and one 8 (488), so adding 1 each.\n- So, total units: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. That seems right.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place.\n- 4 hundreds (1-400) contribute 4*10=40 each.\n- Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449 (10 times) and 8 in 480-488 (9 times, since 480-488 is 9 numbers). So, adding 10 to 4's and 9 to 8's.\n- So, 4's tens: 40 +10=50, 8's tens:40 +9=49. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears 89 times (from 400-488).\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place here because the book only goes up to 488. So, 0 times for 8.\n\nAdding up:\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98 =90. So, 4's appear 90 times more than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just double-check the counts, especially in the tens place for 8. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 times for 8 in the tens place. So, 40 from the hundreds plus 9 gives 49 for 8's in tens place. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4 in the tens place, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 times, added to the 40 from the hundreds, making 50 for 4's in the tens place.\n\nUnits place: 49 each, which seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4's 89, 8's 0.\n\nSo, 188 -98 =90. So, 4's are printed 90 more times than 8's.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't miss any edge cases, like page 400 or 488. For example, page 400: hundreds digit is 4, tens is 0, units is 0. So, 4 is counted in hundreds place. Page 488: hundreds digit 4, tens digit 8, units digit 8. So, in 488, 4 is in hundreds, and 8 is in tens and units. So, that's correctly counted as one 4 in hundreds, one 8 in tens, and one 8 in units.\n\nAnother check: page 444. Hundreds digit 4, tens digit 4, units digit 4. So, all three digits are 4, so that's counted in hundreds, tens, and units. So, that's three 4's for that page, which is correctly included in the counts.\n\nSimilarly, page 480: hundreds digit 4, tens digit 8, units digit 0. So, 4 in hundreds, 8 in tens, which are both counted.\n\nI think I've covered all cases. So, the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each set of ten pages (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) has one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of ten in 480 pages, contributing 48 each.\n   - Pages 481-488 add one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488).\n   - Total: 49 each.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred has ten 4's and ten 8's in the tens place.\n   - Four complete hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 each.\n   - Pages 401-488 add ten 4's (440-449) and nine 8's (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 for 4's, 49 for 8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, appearing 89 times.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 for 4's, 0 for 8's.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should look at each digit place separately\u2014units, tens, hundreds\u2014and count the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each place. That makes sense because each digit place can be analyzed independently.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every set of ten pages, like 1-10, 11-20, and so on, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, in 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, both 4 and 8 appear once each in the units place every ten pages. Therefore, in each ten-page block, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n\nNow, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 more pages. So, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 (from each block) plus one more if the last partial block has a 4 in the units place. Wait, the last partial block is pages 481-488, so the units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, there's a 4 in the units place (page 484) and an 8 in the units place (page 488). Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49 as well. So, in the units place, 4's and 8's are equal.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, in each hundred, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. Therefore, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times each in the tens place every hundred pages.\n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, for each hundred, we have 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so that's 4 x 10 = 40 for each. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). Wait, no, 401-410 would have tens digit 0, 411-420 would have tens digit 1, and so on up to 480-488, which is tens digit 8, but only 9 pages (480-488 is actually 9 pages: 480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but when considering the tens digit, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 480-488). So, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place here?\n\nFrom 401-410: tens digit 0, 10 pages.\n411-420: tens digit 1, 10 pages.\n421-430: tens digit 2, 10 pages.\n431-440: tens digit 3, 10 pages.\n441-450: tens digit 4, 10 pages.\n451-460: tens digit 5, 10 pages.\n461-470: tens digit 6, 10 pages.\n471-480: tens digit 7, 10 pages.\n481-488: tens digit 8, 8 pages (since 488 is the last page, so 481-488 is 8 pages: 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488).\n\nWait, so in the last partial hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times, not 10. So, in the tens place for the last partial hundred, the number of 4's is 10 (from 441-450) and the number of 8's is 8 (from 481-488). So, adding that to the previous 40 each from the complete hundreds, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50, and the number of 8's is 40 + 8 = 48. So, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 48 times. So, the difference here is 2 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. From 401-488, the tens digits go up to 8, but the number of pages where the tens digit is 8 is 8 pages, right? So, 481-488 is 8 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 pages. So, that's correct. So, in the tens place, 4's have 10 more in the last partial hundred, and 8's have 8. So, yes, 4's in tens place total 50, 8's total 48. So, difference is +2 for 4's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. For pages 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so it doesn't contribute to either 4's or 8's. From page 100 onwards, the hundreds digit changes every 100 pages. So, from 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. Now, how many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. Therefore, the number of 4's in the hundreds place is 89. There are no 8's in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8's in the hundreds place are 0.\n\nSo, adding that up, the total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4's appear 188 times.\n\nNow, the total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (48) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 48 = 97. So, 8's appear 97 times.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91. So, there are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those pages, so that's 89 4's. That seems right.\n\nIn the tens place, I had 50 4's and 48 8's, which is a difference of +2 for 4's. In the units place, both had 49 each, so no difference there. So, the total difference is 89 (from hundreds) + 2 (from tens) = 91. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nI think that's the answer. So, 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total complete blocks of 10 in 488 pages: 48 blocks.\n   - Each block contributes 1 '4' and 1 '8' in the units place: 48 each.\n   - Last partial block (481-488): '4' appears once (484), '8' appears once (488).\n   - Total '4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total '8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Complete hundreds: 4 sets (1-100, 101-200, etc.), contributing 40 '4's and 40 '8's.\n   - Last partial hundred (401-488):\n     - '4' appears 10 times (441-450).\n     - '8' appears 8 times (481-488).\n   - Total '4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total '8's: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - '4' appears in pages 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n   - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total '4's: 89.\n   - Total '8's: 0.\n\n**Total Counts**:\n- '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- '8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n**Difference**: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should look at each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every ten numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, and so on, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for the units digit, how many times does 4 appear? Well, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. Each group of ten numbers has one 4 in the units place. So, the number of 4's in the units place would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. Wait, but you can't have a fraction of a digit, so maybe it's 48 times, but since 488 is the last number, which is 488, the 48th group would be 480-488, and in that group, the units digits go from 0 to 8, so 4 appears once in the units place. So, actually, it's 48 times for the 4's in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's in the units place, it's the same logic. Each group of ten has one 8, so 48 times. Wait, but 488 ends with an 8, so in the last group, 480-488, the units digit 8 appears once. So, 48 times for 8's in the units place as well. So, units place contributes 48 4's and 48 8's. So, the difference in the units place is zero. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nNow, let's move on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears in blocks of 100. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), then 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), up to 9 (90-99). So, each digit in the tens place appears 10 times per hundred numbers. So, for 488 pages, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nLet me think. From 1-400, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last hundred is 400-488. So, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 times. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and there are four hundreds in 400, but wait, 400 is part of the 400-488 range. So, from 1-400, there are four sets of 100, each contributing 10 times the tens digit 4, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears another 10 times (440-449), so total 40 + 10 = 50 times? Wait, no, because from 1-400, it's actually 1-400, which is four hundreds. Wait, no, 1-400 is 400 numbers, so it's four sets of 100. Each set contributes 10 times the tens digit 4, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, so total 40+10=50 times for the tens digit 4.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens digit 8, how many times does it appear? Let's see. From 1-400, the tens digit 8 appears in each hundred: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these contributes 10 times, so 4*10=40 times. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times because it's only up to 488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place from 480-488. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 times for the tens digit 8.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. So, the difference here is 50 - 49 = 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since we're dealing with 488 pages, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's see when each digit appears.\n\nFor the hundreds digit 4: it appears from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nFor the hundreds digit 8: well, 800 is beyond 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the hundreds digit 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times and 8 appears 0 times. So, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. The hundreds digit is only 1, 2, 3, or 4, so 8 doesn't appear at all. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let me sum up the differences from each place:\n\n- Units place: 48 - 48 = 0\n- Tens place: 50 - 49 = 1\n- Hundreds place: 89 - 0 = 89\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, for the hundreds place, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times.\n\nFor the tens place, as I calculated earlier, 50 times for 4's and 49 times for 8's, so a difference of 1.\n\nUnits place: 48 times for both, so 0 difference.\n\nSo, total difference is 89 + 1 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the tens place again. From 1-400, the tens digit 4 appears 40 times, and from 401-488, it's 10 times, so 50 total. For 8's in the tens place, from 1-400, it's 40 times, and from 401-488, it's 9 times (480-488), so 49 total. So, yes, 50 - 49 = 1.\n\nAnd units place: 48 times for both, so 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\nTotal 8's: 48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I counted the hundreds place correctly. Let me think again. From 1-399, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3, so no 4's or 8's. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nFor 8's in the hundreds place, since the book only has 488 pages, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, yes, 89 more 4's than 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up, the total difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count any digits. Each page number is considered separately, so each digit is counted in its respective place. So, units, tens, and hundreds are all separate, so adding them up is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the total number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract.\n\nLet me try that approach to verify.\n\nTotal number of 4's:\n\n- Units place: For each group of 10, there's one 4. From 1-488, that's 48 full groups of 10, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last number, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full groups, but the last group is 480-488, which includes another 4 in the units place (484). Wait, no, 480-488 includes 484, which is a 4 in the units place. So, actually, it's 48 full groups plus one more 4 in the units place, making it 49? Wait, no, because from 1-488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of numbers where the units digit is 4. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms is that?\n\nThe sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The nth term is 10n - 6. Wait, no, 4 + 10(n-1) = 10n -6. Wait, 4 is the first term, so n=1: 4, n=2:14, etc. So, the last term is 484, which is 4 + 10*(k-1) = 484. So, 10*(k-1) = 480, so k-1=48, so k=49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but the 49th group is 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the units digit 4 appears once in 480-488, which is 484. So, total 48 +1=49 times in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's in the units place: 8,18,28,...,488. The last term is 488, which is included. So, how many terms? 8 +10*(k-1)=488. So, 10*(k-1)=480, so k-1=48, so k=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 48, but now it's 49. Hmm, maybe I was wrong before. So, units place: 49 4's and 49 8's, so difference 0.\n\nTens place: Let's recalculate.\n\nFor 4's in the tens place: from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens digit?\n\nEach hundred block contributes 10 times. So, from 1-400, there are four hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total 40+10=50 times.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place: from 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 times, so 4*10=40. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, total 40+9=49 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 50 4's and 49 8's, difference of 1.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought 49 units for 4's and 49 for 8's, so that's correct. So, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the units place for 4's was 48, but now it's 49. So, I think I was wrong initially and the correct count is 49 for both 4's and 8's in the units place.\n\nSo, the total difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure again. From 1-488, how many 4's in the units place?\n\nNumbers ending with 4: 4,14,24,34,...,484. The last term is 484, which is 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So, 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, numbers ending with 8: 8,18,28,...,488. Last term is 488, which is 8 + 10*(n-1)=488, so 10*(n-1)=480, n-1=48, n=49. So, 49 times.\n\nSo, units place: 49 each, so 0 difference.\n\nTens place: 50 4's, 49 8's, difference 1.\n\nHundreds place: 89 4's, 0 8's, difference 89.\n\nTotal difference: 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the units place had 48 each, but now it's 49 each. I think the correct count is 49 each, so the difference is 90.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **4's:** Numbers ending with 4 occur every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 such numbers (4, 14, ..., 484).\n   - **8's:** Similarly, numbers ending with 8 occur every 10 numbers, totaling 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - **4's:** The tens digit 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. From 1-400, this happens 40 times, and from 401-488, it's another 10 times, totaling 50.\n   - **8's:** The tens digit 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 40 times from 1-400, and 9 times from 401-488 (480-488), totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **4's:** The hundreds digit 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **8's:** No page number has 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- **4's Total:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's Total:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Page numbers go from 1 to 488, so each page is a number in that range. Each digit of these numbers is printed, so I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears and how many times the digit 8 appears, and then find the difference between those two counts.\n\nMaybe I should start by counting the number of 4's in each digit place separately\u2014like units place, tens place, hundreds place. Similarly, do the same for 8's. Then, sum them up and subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For the units digit, how often does 4 appear? Well, in every set of ten consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, 4 appears exactly once. So, from 1 to 488, how many sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets and then 8 extra numbers. So, in each of the 48 full sets, 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place. Each set of ten has one 8, so 48 sets give 48 eights. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers, 8 appears once (at 488). So, total 8's in units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that seems the same. So, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place. Hmm, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nWait, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, number of 4's in units place is floor(488/10) = 48, plus if the last number's units digit is >=4, then add 1. Since 488's units digit is 8, which is greater than 4, so 48 +1 =49. Similarly for 8's, it's also 48 +1=49. So, yes, both have 49 in units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times in each 100 numbers. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nWait, but wait, actually, each hundred block (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has exactly 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, 101-200, 140-149, another 10, and so on up to 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 is the last block. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place in 400-488? Well, 400-488 includes 400-499, but we're only going up to 488. So, in the tens place, 4 appears from 400-409, which is 10 numbers, and then 410-419, etc., but wait, actually, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 0-8, but 4 appears in the tens place as 400-409, 410-419, etc., but wait, 488 is the end, so the tens digit goes up to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place in 400-488? Let's see, 400-409: 10 times, 410-419: another 10, but wait, 488 is less than 499, so up to 488, the tens digits go up to 8. So, 400-488 includes the tens digits from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except maybe the last one. Wait, no, because 488 is 488, so 480-488 would be the tens digit 8, but only 9 numbers: 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, not 10. Wait, no, 480 to 489 would be 10, but since we're stopping at 488, it's 9 numbers. Hmm, so maybe the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the last block.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe a better approach is to calculate how many times each digit appears in the tens place across all page numbers.\n\nSo, for the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in each hundred. So, in 1-100, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, in 101-200, another 10 times, and so on up to 400-499. But since our book ends at 488, the last hundred (400-488) is incomplete. So, in 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nIn 400-488, the tens digit is 0 for 400-409, 1 for 410-419, 2 for 420-429, 3 for 430-439, 4 for 440-449, 5 for 450-459, 6 for 460-469, 7 for 470-479, 8 for 480-488.\n\nWait, so for the tens digit 4 in 400-488, it's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times in each of the first four hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and 10 times in 400-488. So, total 4's in the tens place would be 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 10 in the last partial hundred, totaling 50 times.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is the fourth hundred, right? So, maybe it's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. But wait, no, because 400-488 is part of the fourth hundred, so maybe it's 10 times in the tens place for 400-488, so total 40 +10=50.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. Each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for each hundred, 10 times 4 in the tens place. There are 4 hundreds (1-400), but the last hundred is only up to 488, not 500. So, does that affect the count? Hmm.\n\nWait, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit goes up to 8, but 4 appears in the tens place as 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, in each of the four hundreds, 10 times, so total 4*10=40 times for 4 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if the last hundred is complete. Let me check: 400-488 is 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, in the tens place, each digit from 0 to 8 appears how many times? For 400-409, tens digit 0, 10 numbers. 410-419, tens digit 1, 10 numbers. Similarly up to 470-479, tens digit 7, 10 numbers. Then 480-488, tens digit 8, 9 numbers. So, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 10 times. So, total 4's in tens place: 4 hundreds *10=40.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place: in each hundred, 10 times. So, from 1-100, 8's in tens place are 80-89, 10 numbers. Similarly, 101-200: 180-189, another 10. 201-300: 280-289, 10. 301-400: 380-389, 10. 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the last hundred, 8's in tens place appear 9 times. So, total 8's in tens place: 4*10 +9=49.\n\nWait, so 4's in tens place: 40, and 8's in tens place:49. So, 4's are less than 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's in tens place were 50, but now I'm getting 40. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let's clarify. Each hundred block has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 1-100: 10, 101-200:10, 201-300:10, 301-400:10, and 400-488:10 for 4's in tens place, but wait, 400-488 is only up to 488, so in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 10 times. So, total 4's in tens place: 4 hundreds *10=40.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place: in each hundred, 10 times, so 4 hundreds *10=40, but in the last hundred, 400-488, 8's in tens place are 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 instead of 10. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 +9=49.\n\nSo, 4's in tens place:40, 8's in tens place:49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case. So, how often does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8's in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, because 800 would be beyond 488. So, 8's in the hundreds place:0.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place:89, 8's:0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:40\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's:49+40+89= 49+40=89, 89+89=178.\n\nWait, 49+40=89, 89+89=178? Wait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 49 (units) +40 (tens)=89, plus 89 (hundreds)=178. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nWait, 49+49=98. So, total 4's:178, total 8's:98.\n\nSo, the difference is 178 -98=80.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, for 4's in the units place:49, tens:40, hundreds:89. Total 178.\n\nFor 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 98.\n\nDifference:178-98=80.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but I'm a bit unsure because I might have made a mistake in counting the tens place for 4's.\n\nWait, earlier I thought 4's in the tens place were 40, but when I first considered it, I thought maybe 50. Let me check again.\n\nIn the tens place, for each hundred, 4 appears 10 times. So, 1-100:40-49, 10 times. 101-200:140-149, 10 times. 201-300:240-249, 10 times. 301-400:340-349, 10 times. 400-488:440-449, 10 times. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50.\n\nWait, wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify: the hundreds go from 1-400, which is four hundreds, but in each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40, but wait, 400-488 is part of the fifth hundred? No, 400-488 is within the fourth hundred, which is 400-499, but we're stopping at 488. So, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, total 4's in tens place:4 hundreds *10=40, plus 10 in 400-488, making it 50? Wait, no, because 400-488 is part of the fourth hundred, so we've already counted 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. But in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears another 10 times, so total 40+10=50.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by not counting the 400-488 as part of the fourth hundred, which it is, so 4's in tens place should be 50, not 40.\n\nWait, let me think again. Each hundred block is 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-500, but we're only going up to 488, so the last hundred is incomplete. So, in each complete hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 1-100:10, 101-200:10, 201-300:10, 301-400:10, so that's 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so another 10. So, total 4's in tens place:40+10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place: in each hundred, 10 times, so 4*10=40, and in 401-488, 8's in tens place are 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, total 8's in tens place:40+9=49.\n\nSo, correcting that, 4's in tens place:50, 8's in tens place:49.\n\nSo, total 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier calculation. So, I think I made a mistake in the initial count of 4's in the tens place. It's actually 50, not 40, because the last hundred (400-488) contributes another 10.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, but I'm a bit confused now because I'm getting two different answers based on how I count the tens place. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternative approach: For each digit place, count the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n- Total numbers:488\n- For each digit 0-9, each appears floor(488/10)=48 times, plus if the last number's units digit is >= the digit, add 1.\n- So, for 4: floor(488/10)=48, and since 488's units digit is 8 >=4, add 1. So, 49.\n- Similarly, for 8:48 +1=49.\n\nTens place:\n- Each digit appears 10 times per hundred, so for 488 numbers, how many hundreds? 4 full hundreds (1-400), and then 88 more (401-488).\n- In each full hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 for 4's, and 4*10=40 for 8's.\n- Now, in the last 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-8. For 4's in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n- For 8's in the tens place, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n- So, total 4's in tens place:40+10=50, 8's:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, total counts:\n- 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n- 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if this is correct because when I first thought about it, I got 80, but after correcting the tens place, I got 90. Let me see if there's another way to check.\n\nAnother way: Let's calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position.\n\nUnits digit:\n- 4's:49, 8's:49.\n\nTens digit:\n- 4's:50, 8's:49.\n\nHundreds digit:\n- 4's:89, 8's:0.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 80, but that was due to a miscalculation in the tens place. So, the correct answer is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure. Let me try to write a small program or use another method to verify.\n\nAlternatively, I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each position up to 488.\n\nUnits digit:\n- For each digit from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488//10=48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 and one 8. So, 48*1=48 for both. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once, 8 appears once. So, total 4's:48+1=49, 8's:48+1=49.\n\nTens digit:\n- For each ten's place, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in each hundred. So, for 488 numbers, how many hundreds? 4 full hundreds (1-400), and 88 more (401-488).\n- In each full hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times per hundred, so 4*10=40.\n- In the last 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488).\n- For 4's in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers.\n- For 8's in the tens place, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n- So, total 4's in tens place:40+10=50, 8's:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds digit:\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) for all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total sets of 10 in 488: 48 full sets, each contributing one 4 and one 8.\n   - Remaining 8 numbers (481-488) contribute one 4 and one 8.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in each hundred.\n   - For 488 numbers, there are 4 full hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's.\n   - In the last 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 4*10 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 times.\n   - The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place within 488.\n   - Total 4's: 89.\n   - Total 8's: 0.\n\nSumming up:\n- Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- Total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Page numbers go from 1 to 488, so each page is a single number, and each digit in those numbers can be analyzed separately. \n\nI remember that when dealing with digits in numbers, it's often helpful to look at each place value separately\u2014like units, tens, hundreds, etc. So maybe I should analyze how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and similarly for the digit 8, then subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times a specific digit appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then considering any remainder.\n\nWait, but since the book has 488 pages, let me check how many complete blocks of 10 there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 pages and an additional 8 pages. So, for each digit, the number of times it appears in the units place in the complete blocks is 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), I need to check how many times 4 and 8 appear in the units place.\n\nLooking at the units place in the remaining 8 pages: 481 ends with 1, 482 with 2, 483 with 3, 484 with 4, 485 with 5, 486 with 6, 487 with 7, and 488 with 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 (from the complete blocks) plus 1, totaling 49. Similarly, the total number of 8's in the units place is 48 plus 1, totaling 49. So, in the units place, both digits appear the same number of times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit changes every 10 pages and stays the same for 10 consecutive numbers. For example, from 1 to 10, the tens digit is 0 (since these are single-digit numbers, but technically, the tens place is 0). From 11 to 20, the tens digit is 1, and so on. So, each digit from 0 to 9 appears in the tens place for exactly 10 consecutive numbers, except possibly for the higher digits if the total number of pages isn't a multiple of 100.\n\nLet me calculate how many times each digit appears in the tens place. The total number of pages is 488, so let's break it down by hundreds. From 1 to 99, the tens digit cycles through 0 to 9, but since we're starting at 1, the first 9 pages (1-9) have 0 in the tens place. Then, from 10 to 99, each tens digit from 1 to 9 appears exactly 10 times. So, for the tens place, from 1 to 99, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times, except 0 appears 9 times (since pages 1-9 have 0 in the tens place, but we're considering two-digit numbers starting from 10). Wait, no, actually, for the tens place, from 1 to 99, the digits 1-9 each appear 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 10-19 have 1 in the tens place, etc.), and 0 appears 9 times (pages 1-9). But when we consider the entire 488 pages, we have more hundreds.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to consider each hundred separately. Let me think: from 1 to 99, the tens digits go from 0 to 9, each appearing 10 times except 0 which appears 9 times. But actually, from 1 to 99, the tens digit cycles every 10 pages. So, for each digit d from 0 to 9, how many times does it appear in the tens place?\n\nFrom 1 to 99, the tens digit is 0 for pages 1-9 (9 times), and for each d from 1 to 9, the tens digit is d for 10 pages each (e.g., 10-19 for d=1, etc.). So, 0 appears 9 times, and digits 1-9 each appear 10 times in the tens place from 1 to 99.\n\nThen, from 100 to 199, the tens digit cycles similarly. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 0 appears 10 times (100-109), 1 appears 10 times (110-119), and so on up to 9 in 190-199.\n\nSimilarly, from 200 to 299, each tens digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times, and the same pattern continues for 300-399, 400-488.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is only 89 pages, so the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except the last one. Let me check: 400-409: tens digit 0 (10 times), 410-419: 1 (10 times), ..., 480-488: tens digit 8, which is only 9 pages (480-488). So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times instead of 10.\n\nSo, to calculate the total number of times each digit appears in the tens place from 1 to 488:\n\nFirst, from 1-99:\n- 0: 9 times\n- 1-9: 10 times each\n\nThen, from 100-399:\nEach hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) has each digit 0-9 appearing 10 times in the tens place. So, 3 hundreds, each contributing 10 times per digit, so 3*10 = 30 times for each digit.\n\nFrom 400-488:\n- Tens digits go from 0 to 8, with 0 appearing 10 times (400-409), 1 appearing 10 times (410-419), ..., 8 appearing 9 times (480-488). So, digits 0-7 each appear 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total for each digit in the tens place:\n\n- For digits 0-7:\n  From 1-99: 9 (for 0) and 10 (for 1-7)\n  From 100-399: 30 each\n  From 400-488: 10 each (except 8)\n  Wait, but let me sum them properly.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to compute separately.\n\nLet me compute the number of times each digit appears in the tens place:\n\n- Digit 0:\n  From 1-99: 9 times\n  From 100-399: 3 hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 30\n  From 400-488: 10 times (400-409)\n  Total: 9 + 30 + 10 = 49\n\n- Digit 1:\n  From 1-99: 10 times (10-19)\n  From 100-399: 30 times (100-109, 110-119, etc.)\n  From 400-488: 10 times (410-419)\n  Total: 10 + 30 + 10 = 50\n\nSimilarly, digits 2-7 will have the same pattern:\n\n- Digit 2:\n  From 1-99: 10\n  From 100-399: 30\n  From 400-488: 10\n  Total: 50\n\nSame for digits 3,4,5,6,7.\n\n- Digit 8:\n  From 1-99: 10 times (80-89)\n  From 100-399: 30 times (180-189, 280-289, 380-389)\n  From 400-488: 9 times (480-488)\n  Total: 10 + 30 + 9 = 49\n\n- Digit 9:\n  From 1-99: 10 times (90-99)\n  From 100-399: 30 times (190-199, 290-299, 390-399)\n  From 400-488: 0 times (since 488 < 490)\n  Total: 10 + 30 + 0 = 40\n\nWait, but the problem is only about digits 4 and 8, so maybe I can focus on those.\n\nSo, in the tens place:\n\n- Digit 4:\n  From 1-99: 10 times (40-49)\n  From 100-399: 30 times (140-149, 240-249, 340-349)\n  From 400-488: 10 times (440-449)\n  So, total for 4 in tens place: 10 + 30 + 10 = 50\n\n- Digit 8:\n  From 1-99: 10 times (80-89)\n  From 100-399: 30 times (180-189, 280-289, 380-389)\n  From 400-488: 9 times (480-488)\n  So, total for 8 in tens place: 10 + 30 + 9 = 49\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place?\n\n- Digit 0: 0 times (since pages 1-99 have no hundreds digit, or it's 0, but we're only counting digits printed, and page numbers don't have leading zeros)\n- Digit 1: 100-199, which is 100 pages, so 100 times\n- Digit 2: 200-299, 100 times\n- Digit 3: 300-399, 100 times\n- Digit 4: 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89)\n\nSo, for digits 4 and 8 in the hundreds place:\n\n- Digit 4: 89 times (from 400 to 488)\n- Digit 8: 0 times, since the book only goes up to 488, so there's no page 800-899.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let me sum up the total number of times 4 and 8 appear in all places (units, tens, hundreds).\n\nStarting with 4:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal for 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times\n\nNow for 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal for 8: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times\n\nWait, but wait, earlier in the units place, I thought both 4 and 8 appeared 49 times each, but let me double-check that. From 1-488, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 pages. So, total number of complete cycles is 48 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8), so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units digits for 4: 48 + 1 = 49, same for 8: 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, but 400-488 is 89 pages, so yes, each page from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the hundreds place, since the book ends at 488, there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place, so 0.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 4. Let me recheck that.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4:\n\nFrom 1-99: 10 times (40-49)\n\nFrom 100-399: 3 hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 30\n\nFrom 400-488: 10 times (440-449)\n\nTotal: 10 + 30 + 10 = 50\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place:\n\nFrom 1-99: 10 times (80-89)\n\nFrom 100-399: 30 times\n\nFrom 400-488: 9 times (480-488)\n\nTotal: 10 + 30 + 9 = 49\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because when I thought about the units place, I considered 488 pages, which is 48 full tens and 8 extra. So, in units place, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times, plus in the extra 8 pages, digits 1-8 appear once each. So, 4 and 8 each get an extra 1, making their units count 49 each.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times in each hundred, but wait, no, that's not quite right. Because each hundred has 100 pages, so in each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, from 1-99, 100-199, etc., each contributes 10 times per digit in the tens place.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each place across all pages.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a more systematic approach.\n\nAnother way: For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nTotal number of complete groups of 10 in 488 pages: floor(488 / 10) = 48 groups. Each group contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 * 1 = 48 for each digit.\n\nThen, the remaining pages: 488 - (48 * 10) = 488 - 480 = 8 pages, which are 481-488. The units digits here are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units digits: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach digit in the tens place appears 10 times every 100 pages. So, in 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? floor(488 / 100) = 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, etc.), but actually, 4*100=400, so up to 400. Wait, no, 488 is less than 500, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 pages from 401-488.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to consider how many times each digit appears in the tens place across all page numbers.\n\nFor the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in every 100 pages. So, for 488 pages, we can calculate how many complete 100s there are and then handle the remaining pages.\n\nNumber of complete hundreds: floor(488 / 100) = 4, with a remainder of 88 pages.\n\nSo, for each digit d in 0-9, the number of times it appears in the tens place is:\n\n- In each complete hundred: 10 times\n- In the remaining 88 pages: check how many times d appears in the tens place.\n\nWait, but the remaining 88 pages are from 401 to 488, which is 88 pages. The tens digit in 401-488 cycles from 0 to 8, since 488 is the last page.\n\nSo, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for 8, which appears 9 times because 480-488 is only 9 pages (480,481,...,488).\n\nWait, no, 480-488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, in the remaining 88 pages:\n\n- Tens digits 0: 10 times (401-410)\n- 1: 10 (411-420)\n- 2: 10 (421-430)\n- 3: 10 (431-440)\n- 4: 10 (441-450)\n- 5: 10 (451-460)\n- 6: 10 (461-470)\n- 7: 10 (471-480)\n- 8: 9 times (481-488, but wait, 481-488 is 8 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488 inclusive). Wait, 480 is the start, so 480-488 is 9 pages: 480,481,...,488.\n\nWait, but 480 is included in the remaining 88 pages? Wait, 401-488 is 88 pages, right? 488 - 401 + 1 = 88.\n\nSo, 401-410: 10 pages, tens digit 0\n\n411-420: 10, tens digit 1\n\n...\n\n480-488: 9 pages, tens digit 8\n\nSo, in the remaining 88 pages:\n\n- Tens digits 0-7: 10 each\n\n- Tens digit 8: 9\n\nSo, for each digit d:\n\n- If d is 0-7: 10 times in the remaining 88 pages\n\n- If d is 8: 9 times\n\n- d=9: 0 times\n\nTherefore, total times each digit appears in the tens place:\n\n- For d=4:\n\n  Complete hundreds: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40\n\n  Remaining 88 pages: 10 times\n\n  Total: 40 + 10 = 50\n\n- For d=8:\n\n  Complete hundreds: 4*10=40\n\n  Remaining 88 pages: 9 times\n\n  Total: 40 + 9 = 49\n\nSimilarly, for other digits.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nEach digit appears in the hundreds place for a range of 100 pages.\n\n- d=0: pages 1-99, but since we're not considering leading zeros, d=0 doesn't appear in the hundreds place.\n\n- d=1: 100-199: 100 pages\n\n- d=2: 200-299: 100\n\n- d=3: 300-399: 100\n\n- d=4: 400-488: 89 pages\n\n- d=5-9: 0 pages, since the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, for d=4, hundreds place: 89 times\n\nd=8: 0 times\n\nSo, total for 4 in hundreds place: 89\n\nTotal for 8 in hundreds place: 0\n\nNow, adding up all places:\n\nFor 4:\n\n- Units: 49\n\n- Tens: 50\n\n- Hundreds: 89\n\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8:\n\n- Units: 49\n\n- Tens: 49\n\n- Hundreds: 0\n\nTotal: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nSo, 4's are printed 90 times more than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, 4's are printed 90 more times than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and do the same for the digit 8, then subtract the two to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the pages from 1 to 488. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. So, I need to analyze each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each place and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. So, for the units digit, the number of 4's and 8's should be the same, right? But wait, does this hold true all the way up to 488? I think so because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets of 10 pages, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. That would give 48 of each. But wait, from 1 to 488, the last page is 488, so the units digit goes up to 8. So, actually, the units digit cycles 48 times, each time giving one 4 and one 8. So, units place: 48 4's and 48 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. So, for each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times in each hundred, and similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times in each hundred. Now, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, from 1 to 400, there are 4 full hundreds. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 4's in the tens place. Similarly, 8's in the tens place would also be 4*10=40. But wait, we're going up to 488, which is beyond 400. So, from 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and the digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place beyond 400, we have 10 4's and 9 8's. So, total in the tens place: 40 (from 1-400) +10=50 4's, and 40 +9=49 8's. Wait, that can't be right because I think I made a mistake. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, actually, from 1 to 400, the tens digit cycles four times, each time giving 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, that's 4*10=40 for each digit. Then, from 401 to 488, which is 88 pages, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and the digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is included. So, the tens place for 4's is 40 +10=50, and for 8's it's 40 +9=49. So, in the tens place, there are 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\nNow, onto the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place contributes 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. The hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages, so that's 89 4's. The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all because the book ends at 488, which is still in the 400s. So, hundreds place: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nNow, let me sum up all the digits. For the units place: 48 4's and 48 8's. For the tens place: 50 4's and 49 8's. For the hundreds place: 89 4's and 0 8's. So, total 4's: 48 +50 +89= 187. Total 8's: 48 +49 +0=97. So, the difference is 187-97=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did the units place correctly. From 1 to 488, how many times does the units digit 4 appear? Well, every 10 pages, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. Similarly, 8's in the units place would be 48 times. But wait, does the last page, 488, add an extra 8 in the units place? Because 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that would make it 49 times for 8's in the units place. Wait, that's a mistake. Earlier, I thought units place 4's and 8's are both 48, but actually, 8's would be 49 because 488 is included. Let me recalculate.\n\nSo, units place: 4's appear 48 times, and 8's appear 49 times. Then, tens place: 50 4's and 49 8's. Hundreds place: 89 4's and 0 8's. So, total 4's: 48 +50 +89=187. Total 8's:49 +49 +0=98. So, the difference is 187-98=89. Hmm, that's different from before. So, I think I made a mistake in the units place earlier. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, when counting units digits, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 pages, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets, each contributing an 8, and then an extra 8 in the units place at 488. So, that's 49 times. Similarly, 4's in the units place would be 48 times because 488 doesn't end with a 4. So, units place: 48 4's and 49 8's.\n\nSo, correcting that, total 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89)=187. Total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. So, the difference is 187-98=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the units place for 8's was 49, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (1-480), each contributing one 8, and then 481-488, where 488 has an 8. So, that's 48 +1=49 8's in the units place. Similarly, 4's in the units place would be 48 times because 484 is the last page ending with 4 before 488. So, yes, 48 times.\n\nSo, with that correction, the total 4's are 187 and 8's are 98, so the difference is 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 1-400, the tens digit cycles 4 times, each time giving 10 4's and 10 8's, so 40 each. Then from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, that's correct: 10 for 4's and 9 for 8's in the tens place beyond 400. So, total tens place: 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\nSo, adding up: units (48 4's, 49 8's), tens (50 4's, 49 8's), hundreds (89 4's, 0 8's). So, total 4's: 48+50+89=187, and 8's:49+49+0=98. So, 187-98=89.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 pages.\n   - Number of 4's: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles).\n   - Number of 8's: 49 (including the 8 in 488).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - From 1 to 400, the tens digit cycles every 100 pages, giving 10 4's and 10 8's per cycle. With 4 cycles, that's 40 each.\n   - From 401 to 488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages.\n   - Number of 4's: 89.\n   - Number of 8's: 0.\n\nSumming up:\n- Total 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n- Total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Page numbers go from 1 to 488, so each page is a number in that range. The task is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears, then find the difference between those two counts.\n\nMaybe I should start by understanding how digits are distributed in numbers. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to three digits, specifically up to 488. So, I need to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nLet me try to approach this by looking at each digit position one by one. I'll start with the units place because that seems simpler. For the units place, the digits cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times a particular digit appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then considering any remainder.\n\nWait, but 488 isn't a multiple of 10. So, I might need to adjust for that. Let me think. The total number of units digits from 1 to 488 would be 488 numbers, each contributing one digit in the units place. So, the number of times each digit appears in the units place can be calculated as follows: for digits 0 through 9, each digit appears floor(488/10) = 48 times in each set of 10. But wait, that might not be entirely accurate because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times, and then there's a remainder of 8. So, the digits from 0 to 8 would each appear one more time in the units place beyond the 48 times, right? Because 488 = 48*10 + 8, so the first 480 numbers have 48 of each digit in the units place, and then the last 8 numbers (481 to 488) have units digits 1 through 8. So, digits 1 through 8 each get one more count, and 9 and 0 don't get an extra count beyond 48.\n\nWait, but does that apply to 0? Let me check. The first page is 1, so the units digit 0 only starts appearing from page 10 onwards. So, in the first 10 pages, pages 1-10, the units digits are 1-0. So, 0 appears once in the units place at page 10. Then, every 10 pages, 0 appears once. So, up to page 480, 0 would have appeared 48 times in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1-8, so 0 doesn't appear again. So, yes, 0 appears 48 times, and digits 1-8 each appear 48 times plus one more in the last 8 numbers, so 49 times each. Wait, but that would mean digits 1-8 appear 49 times, and 9 appears 48 times. Hmm, but wait, let me confirm.\n\nWait, no, maybe I made a mistake there. Let's think again. From 1 to 480, how many times does each digit appear in the units place? For each digit 0-9, it's 48 times because 480 divided by 10 is 48. So, 0 appears 48 times, 1 appears 48 times, up to 9 appearing 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, that's 8 more numbers. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, each of these digits gets an extra count. So, digits 1-8 each appear 48 + 1 = 49 times, and digits 9 and 0 remain at 48 times. So, in the units place, the count of 4 is 49, and the count of 8 is also 49. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So, the difference in the units place is zero.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So, the units place doesn't contribute to the difference. Now, I need to check the tens place. Let me consider the tens digit. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), then 1 (11-19), 2 (21-29), up to 9 (91-99). Each of these digits appears 10 times in the tens place. Then, this pattern repeats for each subsequent hundred.\n\nSo, up to page 488, how many hundreds do we have? 488 is 4 hundreds (400) plus 88 pages. So, let's break it down:\n\n1. Pages 1-99: The tens digit cycles through 0-9, each appearing 10 times. So, for each digit 0-9, they appear 10 times in the tens place.\n\n2. Pages 100-199: Similarly, the tens digit cycles again, so each digit 0-9 appears 10 times.\n\n3. Pages 200-299: Same pattern, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times.\n\n4. Pages 300-399: Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times.\n\n5. Pages 400-488: Here, we only go up to 488, so the tens digits here would be 0 (for 400-409), 1 (410-419), 2 (420-429), 3 (430-439), 4 (440-449), 5 (450-459), 6 (460-469), 7 (470-479), and 8 (480-488). Wait, so let's see how many times each digit appears in the tens place here.\n\nWait, from 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but how many times does each digit appear?\n\n- Tens digit 0: pages 400-409, that's 10 pages.\n- Tens digit 1: 410-419, 10 pages.\n- Tens digit 2: 420-429, 10 pages.\n- Tens digit 3: 430-439, 10 pages.\n- Tens digit 4: 440-449, 10 pages.\n- Tens digit 5: 450-459, 10 pages.\n- Tens digit 6: 460-469, 10 pages.\n- Tens digit 7: 470-479, 10 pages.\n- Tens digit 8: 480-488, which is 9 pages, right? Because 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here.\n\nWait, but that's only up to 488, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times instead of 10. So, for the tens place in the 400-488 range, digits 0-7 each appear 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, now, let's calculate the total number of times each digit appears in the tens place up to page 488.\n\nFrom pages 1-399, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in each hundred, so 4 hundreds (1-399) would have each digit appearing 4*10 = 40 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, no, actually, pages 1-99 is the first hundred, 100-199 is the second, 200-299 the third, and 300-399 the fourth. So, that's four hundreds, each contributing 10 times per digit in the tens place, so 4*10 = 40 times each for digits 0-9 in the tens place.\n\nThen, from 400-488, as we saw, digits 0-7 appear 10 times each, and 8 appears 9 times. So, for each digit:\n\n- Digits 0-7: 40 (from 1-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 50 times each.\n- Digit 8: 40 (from 1-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 49 times.\n- Digit 9: 40 times (since 400-488 doesn't have a tens digit 9, so no additional counts).\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because in the 400-488 range, the tens digits go up to 8, so digit 9 in the tens place doesn't appear at all. So, digit 9 in the tens place only appears up to page 399, which is 40 times.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here because in the 400-488 range, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, so digits 0-8 each appear a certain number of times, but 9 doesn't appear in the tens place beyond page 399. So, for the tens place:\n\n- Digits 0-8: 40 (from 1-399) + their counts in 400-488.\n- Digit 9: remains at 40 times.\n\nWait, but in 400-488, as I calculated earlier, digits 0-7 each appear 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times. So, adding that to the previous 40 times:\n\n- Digits 0-7: 40 + 10 = 50 times each.\n- Digit 8: 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n- Digit 9: 40 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 50 times, and the digit 8 appears 49 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears once more than 8.\n\nWait, but I should check if that's correct. Let me recount:\n\nFrom 1-399, each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place. Then, from 400-488:\n\n- Tens digit 0: 10 times (400-409)\n- Tens digit 1: 10 times (410-419)\n- Tens digit 2: 10 times (420-429)\n- Tens digit 3: 10 times (430-439)\n- Tens digit 4: 10 times (440-449)\n- Tens digit 5: 10 times (450-459)\n- Tens digit 6: 10 times (460-469)\n- Tens digit 7: 10 times (470-479)\n- Tens digit 8: 9 times (480-488)\n\nSo, digits 0-7 each get an additional 10 counts, and 8 gets 9 counts. So, adding to the previous 40:\n\n- 0: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 1: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 2: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 3: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 4: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 5: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 6: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 7: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 8: 40 + 9 = 49\n- 9: 40\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears one more time than 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is a bit different because it only changes every 100 pages. So, from 1-99, there's no hundreds digit; it's effectively 0. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1. From 200-299, it's 2, and so on.\n\nSo, up to page 488, the hundreds digits are:\n\n- 0: for pages 1-99 (99 pages)\n- 1: for pages 100-199 (100 pages)\n- 2: for pages 200-299 (100 pages)\n- 3: for pages 300-399 (100 pages)\n- 4: for pages 400-488 (89 pages)\n\nWait, pages 400-488: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n\nSo, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place?\n\n- 0: 99 times (pages 1-99)\n- 1: 100 times (100-199)\n- 2: 100 times (200-299)\n- 3: 100 times (300-399)\n- 4: 89 times (400-488)\n- 5-9: 0 times, since we don't reach page 500.\n\nWait, but I'm only considering up to 488, so 5-9 in the hundreds place don't appear at all.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, digit 4 appears 89 times, and digits 1, 2, 3 each appear 100 times. The other digits (0,5-9) don't appear in the hundreds place beyond what's already counted.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place, digits 0,5-9 don't appear, except 0 for the first 99 pages. So, in the hundreds place, digit 4 appears 89 times, and digits 1,2,3 each appear 100 times.\n\nSo, for the hundreds place, how many times does 4 appear? 89 times. How about 8? Well, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, which is 4 in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, that's correct because 488 is 4 in the hundreds place, and 8 is in the tens and units places. So, in the hundreds place, 8 doesn't appear at all. So, the count for 8 in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's than 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, to find the total number of times 4 appears, I need to sum up its appearances in the units, tens, and hundreds places. Similarly for 8.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\nFor 4:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate that: 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nFor 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me check:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a significant difference, and I want to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n- Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place from 1-480, then digits 1-8 each get an extra count in 481-488. So, 4 and 8 each have 48 +1 =49 counts in units.\n\nTens place:\n\n- From 1-399, each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place.\n\n- From 400-488, digits 0-7 each appear 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, for 4 in the tens place: 40 +10=50.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place: 40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n\n- 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 +50 +89= 188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those pages. So, 89 times. So, that's correct.\n\nAnd in the tens place, from 400-488, 4 in the tens place is from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 counts, adding to the 40 from before, making it 50.\n\nSimilarly, 8 in the tens place is from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 counts, adding to the 40 from before, making it 49.\n\nUnits place: 49 each.\n\nSo, yes, the calculations seem correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n### Units Place\n- Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times in the units place from pages 1 to 480.\n- Pages 481 to 488 add 1 more count for digits 1 through 8.\n- Therefore, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place.\n\n### Tens Place\n- Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 40 times in the tens place from pages 1 to 399.\n- From pages 400 to 488:\n  - Digits 0-7 each appear 10 times.\n  - Digit 8 appears 9 times.\n- Therefore, 4 appears 50 times (40 + 10) and 8 appears 49 times (40 + 9) in the tens place.\n\n### Hundreds Place\n- Digits 0, 1, 2, and 3 each appear 100 times in the hundreds place.\n- Digit 4 appears 89 times (pages 400-488).\n- Digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n- Therefore, 4 appears 89 times and 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\n### Total Counts\n- **4's**: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's**: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n### Difference\n- The difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nThus, the number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Maybe I should look at each digit place separately\u2014units, tens, hundreds\u2014and count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place. That makes sense because each digit contributes independently to the total count.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 pages, the digits 0 through 9 cycle. So in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once every 10 pages. Since the book has 488 pages, that's 488 divided by 10, which is 48 full cycles, and then 8 extra pages (since 48*10=480, and 488-480=8). So in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times (once every 10 pages) plus one more time in the 480th page, which is page 480. Wait, no, 480 is page 480, so the units digit is 0. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there. Let me correct that. The last full cycle ends at page 480, so the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 in 481-490, but since the book ends at 488, the units digits from 481 to 488 are 1 to 8. So in the units place, the digit 4 appears once every 10 pages, and since there are 48 full cycles, that's 48 times, plus in the incomplete cycle (481-488), does 4 appear? Let me check: 484 is within 481-488, so that's another 4. So total units place 4's would be 48 +1 =49 times. Similarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, it would appear once every 10 pages, so 48 times, plus in the incomplete cycle, 488 is the last page, so 488 has 8 in the units place. So that's 48 +1=49 times as well. Wait, but that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so units digit 8 appears once in each cycle, and in the incomplete cycle, it appears once at 488. So units place: 4's=49, 8's=49. So difference in units place is 0.\n\nNow moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 pages. So for 488 pages, how many full hundreds are there? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 pages in the next hundred (401-488). So in each full hundred, the tens digit cycles 10 times for each digit. So for digit 4 in the tens place, each full hundred contributes 10 times (e.g., 40-49 in the first hundred, 140-149 in the second, etc.). So 4 full hundreds would have 4*10=40 times. Then in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So total tens place 4's would be 40 +10=50 times. Similarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place, each full hundred contributes 10 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4*10=40 times. In the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 times. So total tens place 8's would be 40 +9=49 times. So the difference in tens place is 50 (for 4's) minus 49 (for 8's) =1.\n\nNow for the hundreds place. The hundreds digit cycles every 1000 pages, but since the book is only 488 pages, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears only in pages 400-488. How many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. The digit 8 in the hundreds place would require the hundreds digit to be 8, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo now, let's add up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89= 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98\n\nSo the difference is 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the units place. Let me check again. For the units place, each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages. So for 488 pages, there are 48 full cycles of 10 pages, and 8 extra pages (481-488). So units digit 4 appears 48 times in the full cycles, and in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (at 484). So total units 4's:48 +1=49. Similarly, units 8's:48 times in full cycles, plus once at 488, so 49. So that part was correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4's: each full hundred contributes 10 times, so 4 hundreds give 40, plus in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so total 50. For 8's in tens place: each full hundred gives 10, so 40, plus in the partial hundred, 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 40+9=49. So tens place difference is 1.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So 89-0=89.\n\nAdding up the differences from each place: units place difference 0, tens place difference +1, hundreds place difference +89. So total difference is 0 +1 +89=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times. But 8 in the hundreds place would require pages 800-899, which is beyond 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So yes, 89 times for 4 and 0 for 8 in hundreds place.\n\nSo total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check again. In the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So that's 9 times, so 40+9=49. So that's correct.\n\nSo I think the difference is 90, meaning there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place would have more, but let me confirm. 4's in hundreds place:89, 8's:0. So that's a difference of 89. Then in tens place, 50-49=1, so total difference 89+1=90. Units place difference is 0, so total difference is 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n- Total cycles: 48 full cycles (480 pages) + 8 extra pages (481-488).\n- 4 appears 48 times in full cycles + 1 time in extra pages = 49.\n- 8 appears 48 times in full cycles + 1 time in extra pages = 49.\n- Difference: 49 - 49 = 0.\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n- Full hundreds: 4 sets (400 pages) + 88 extra pages (401-488).\n- 4 appears 4*10=40 times in full hundreds + 10 times in 440-449 = 50.\n- 8 appears 4*10=40 times in full hundreds + 9 times in 480-488 = 49.\n- Difference: 50 - 49 = 1.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- 4 appears in pages 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n- Difference: 89 - 0 = 89.\n\n**Total Difference:**\n- Units: 0\n- Tens: +1\n- Hundreds: +89\n- **Total:** 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should look at each digit place separately, like units, tens, hundreds, and see how often 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nLet me start by understanding the range of page numbers. The book has pages from 1 to 488, so the page numbers can be 1-digit, 2-digit, or 3-digit numbers. But wait, 488 is a 3-digit number, so the page numbers go up to three digits. Maybe I should analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every set of ten pages, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for 4, it would appear once every ten pages, same with 8. But I need to calculate how many times this happens up to page 488.\n\nWait, but 488 isn't a multiple of 10, so the last set would be from 481 to 488, which is only 8 pages. So, I should calculate how many complete sets of 10 there are and then check the remaining pages.\n\nTotal pages are 488, so the number of complete tens is 488 divided by 10, which is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 complete sets of 10 pages each. In each set, 4 appears once in the units place, so 48 times. Similarly, 8 appears once per set, so 48 times. But wait, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 4 appear in the units place here? Yes, at 484. And 8 appears at 488. So, that adds one more 4 and one more 8. So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 times for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 times for 8. Hmm, so in the units place, they are equal. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in a block of 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 pages.\n\nNow, how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). In each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for each hundred, that's 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8.\n\nSo, for 4 hundreds, that would be 4 * 10 = 40 times for 4 and 4 * 10 = 40 times for 8 in the tens place. Now, we have the remaining pages from 401 to 488, which is 88 pages. Wait, no, actually, 488 is 4 hundreds plus 88 pages. So, the tens place in the remaining 88 pages (from 401 to 488) would be from 401-488. Let me break this down.\n\nFrom 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles through 0 to 8, but we need to check how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place. Wait, but 401 to 488 is 88 pages, so the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490), but since we're only going up to 488, the last set is 481-488, which is 8 pages.\n\nSo, in the tens place, for each hundred, we have 10 occurrences of each digit. But in the incomplete hundred, from 401 to 488, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nLooking at the tens digit in 401-488:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4 (this is where 4 appears)\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears once in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. And 8 appears once in 481-488, which is 8 pages. Wait, but in the tens place, 8 appears in 481-490, but since we're only going up to 488, it's only 8 pages. However, in the tens place, each occurrence is a full 10 pages, but in this case, the last set is only 8 pages. So, does that mean 8 appears in the tens place once for 8 pages? Or does it still count as a full 10? Hmm, I think it's only 8 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 pages, meaning 8 appears 8 times in the tens place from 481-488.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Because from 481-488, the tens digit is 8 for all those pages, so each of those 8 pages has an 8 in the tens place. So, yes, 8 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (from 441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (from 481-488). So, total in the tens place: 40 (from the first 400 pages) + 10 = 50 times for 4, and 40 + 8 = 48 times for 8. So, the tens place contributes 50 for 4 and 48 for 8, making a difference of 2 more 4's than 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because in the first 400 pages, each hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place, so 4 hundreds would be 4*10=40 for 4 and 4*10=40 for 8. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit for 4 appears once in 441-450, which is 10 times, and for 8, it's in 481-488, which is 8 times. So, total in tens place: 40+10=50 for 4, and 40+8=48 for 8. So, yes, that's correct. So, the tens place gives 50 4's and 48 8's, so 2 more 4's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case, since the book goes up to 488. So, let's see how often 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place.\n\nFrom 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's 0. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1. From 200-299, it's 2. From 300-399, it's 3. From 400-488, it's 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book doesn't go beyond 488, which is still in the 400s. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place. On the other hand, 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400 to 488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? It's the number of pages from 400 to 488 inclusive, which is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's count is 89, and 8's count is 0. So, that's a difference of 89 more 4's than 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up the differences from each digit place:\n\n- Units place: 49 vs 49, difference 0\n- Tens place: 50 vs 48, difference +2\n- Hundreds place: 89 vs 0, difference +89\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 2 + 89 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each calculation to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nTotal pages: 488.\n\nNumber of complete tens: 488 // 10 = 48, with a remainder of 8.\n\nIn each complete ten, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place, so 48 each.\n\nIn the last partial set (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units total: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4, 48 +1 =49 for 8. So, correct, difference 0.\n\nTens place:\n\nFirst 400 pages: 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 each.\n\nFrom 401-488, which is 88 pages, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488).\n\nLooking for 4 and 8 in the tens place:\n\n- 441-450: tens digit 4, 10 pages \u2192 10 times\n- 481-488: tens digit 8, 8 pages \u2192 8 times\n\nSo, total tens place:\n\n4's: 40 +10=50\n\n8's: 40 +8=48\n\nDifference: +2\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly from 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, difference in hundreds place: +89\n\nTotal difference: 0 (units) +2 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =91.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the tens place, from 401-488, I considered 441-450 as 10 pages, which is correct because 441 to 450 is 10 pages. Similarly, 481-488 is 8 pages, so 8 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nSo, adding up, the total number of 4's is 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Because I was calculating the total number of 4's and 8's separately, but perhaps I should sum them up correctly.\n\nWait, no, actually, I think I confused myself earlier. Let me correct this.\n\nWait, no, actually, I think I was correct in the initial approach by calculating the difference per digit place and then summing the differences. So, units place: 0 difference, tens place: +2, hundreds place: +89. So, total difference is 91.\n\nBut let me check another way: total number of 4's and 8's.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\nUnits: 49\n\nTens:50\n\nHundreds:89\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:48\n\nHundreds:0\n\nTotal 8's:49+48=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't overcount in the hundreds place. From 400-488, each page has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 pages, so 89 4's. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place, 4's: 40 from the first 400 pages, plus 10 from 441-450, total 50. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 49. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:40 from first 400 pages, plus 8 from 481-488, total 48.\n\nHundreds:0\n\nTotal 8's:49+48=97.\n\nSo, 188-97=91.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think that's the answer. So, the number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total complete sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 sets.\n   - 4 and 8 each appear 48 times.\n   - Last partial set (481-488): 4 appears once (484), 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total: 49 times each.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - First 400 pages: 4 sets of 100, so 40 times each.\n   - Remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n     - 4 appears 10 times (441-450).\n     - 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n   - Total: 50 times for 4, 48 times for 8.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in pages 400-488: 89 times.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- **Units:** 49 (4's) - 49 (8's) = 0\n- **Tens:** 50 (4's) - 48 (8's) = +2\n- **Hundreds:** 89 (4's) - 0 (8's) = +89\n\n**Total Difference:** 0 + 2 + 89 = 91\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Maybe I should look at each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds. That might make it easier to count the occurrences of 4 and 8.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every 10 pages, the digits 0 through 9 appear once in the units place. So, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally. Since the book has 488 pages, the units digit cycles every 10 pages. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra pages.\n\nIn each complete set of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears once. So, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 times 1, which is 48, plus any additional 4's in the remaining 8 pages. Wait, in the remaining 8 pages, which are pages 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, the digit 4 appears once (page 484) and 8 appears once (page 488). So, units place contributes 49 4's and 49 8's? Wait, no, because in the first 480 pages, we have 48 4's and 48 8's, and then in the last 8 pages, we have one more 4 and one more 8. So, total units place: 49 4's and 49 8's. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place over 100 pages. So, for example, from page 1 to 100, the tens digit is 0 for pages 1-9, 1 for 10-19, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, in each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSince the book is 488 pages, that's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). Wait, no, 400 to 488 is 89 pages, right? Wait, 488 minus 400 is 88, so pages 401 to 488 is 88 pages. Hmm, maybe I should check that again. Wait, 401 to 488 inclusive is 488 - 400 = 88 pages, but since we start at 401, that's 88 pages. So, the tens digit from 401 to 488: let's see, 401-410: tens digit is 0, 411-420: 1, 421-430: 2, 431-440: 3, 441-450: 4, 451-460: 5, 461-470: 6, 471-480: 7, and 481-488: 8. Wait, but 481-488 is only 8 pages, so the tens digit here is 8, but only for 8 pages, not 10.\n\nSo, for the tens place, in each full hundred (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.), each digit 0-9 appears 10 times. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, each hundred contributes 10 4's, and similarly for 8. Since there are 4 full hundreds, that's 4 times 10, which is 40 4's and 40 8's from the tens place in the full hundreds.\n\nNow, in the last partial hundred (401-488), we need to see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place. From 401-410: tens digit is 0, so no 4 or 8. 411-420: tens digit 1, no. 421-430: 2, no. 431-440: 3, no. 441-450: 4, so that's 10 pages where the tens digit is 4. So, that's 10 more 4's. Then 451-460: 5, no. 461-470: 6, no. 471-480: 7, no. 481-488: 8, but only 8 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 pages, so that's 8 more 8's.\n\nWait, so in the partial hundred, we have 10 more 4's and 8 more 8's. So, total for the tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 = 50 4's, and 40 + 8 = 48 8's. Wait, but that seems inconsistent because in the last partial hundred, we have 10 4's and 8 8's. So, adding to the full hundreds: 40 +10 =50 4's, and 40 +8=48 8's.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Because in the last partial hundred, from 401-488, the tens digits are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. But each of these digits appears only for a certain number of pages. Specifically, the tens digit 4 appears from 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 4's. The tens digit 8 appears from 481-490, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so that's only 8 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in the last partial hundred.\n\nSo, the total for the tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) +10=50 4's, and 40 +8=48 8's.\n\nWait, but that would mean in the tens place, there are 50 4's and 48 8's. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and then 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, 400-488 is in the 400s, so the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages, right? Because 488 - 400 +1=89. So, 89 times, the hundreds digit is 4. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nAs for 8 in the hundreds place, does it appear anywhere? The hundreds digit goes up to 4 in this book, since it's 488 pages. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 does not appear in the hundreds place at all. Therefore, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, adding up all the places:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = let me add that up. 49 +50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 +48 = 97.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 188 -97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big difference, and I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 pages, 4 appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484). So, total units place 4's: 48 +1=49. Similarly, 8 appears once in each set of 10, so 48 times, plus once in the remaining pages (488), so 48 +1=49. So, units place: 49 each.\n\nTens place:\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9, each appearing 10 times. So, for 4 full hundreds (1-400), each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place, so 4*10=40 for each digit. Now, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nFrom 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 pages)\n411-420: 1 (10)\n421-430: 2 (10)\n431-440: 3 (10)\n441-450: 4 (10)\n451-460: 5 (10)\n461-470: 6 (10)\n471-480: 7 (10)\n481-488: 8 (8 pages)\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, total tens place 4's: 40 (from full hundreds) +10=50. 8's: 40 +8=48.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 or 1? Wait, actually, in page numbers, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, right? Because page 1 is just 1, not 001. So, the hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99+89=188.\n\n8's: units (49) + tens (48) + hundreds (0) = 49+48=97.\n\nDifference: 188 -97=91.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds digit for pages 1-99 is 0, so it doesn't count. So, in the hundreds place, only 4 appears 89 times, and 8 doesn't appear at all. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the units and tens again. For units, I had 49 each, which seems correct because 488/10=48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4 and one 8, plus the remaining 8 pages, which include 4 and 8 once each. So, 48+1=49 each.\n\nIn the tens place, in the full hundreds, each digit appears 10 times, so 40 each. Then in the last partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, 40+10=50 for 4's, and 40+8=48 for 8's.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+48=97.\n\nDifference: 188-97=91.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 91.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Maybe I should look at each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers are three digits at most, right? Wait, actually, page 1 is just 1, page 10 is 10, and so on up to 488. So, I might need to consider how often each digit (4 and 8) appears in each place: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears once. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear equally. But wait, the book has 488 pages, which is 48 full sets of 10 pages and then 8 more pages. So, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 times 1 (from each 10 pages) plus 1 if the last 8 pages include a 4. Wait, the last 8 pages would be from 481 to 488. So, the units digits in this last partial block are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So, in this case, the units digit 4 appears once. So, total 4's in units place would be 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, 8's in units place would be 48 + 1 (since 488 is the last page, units digit 8 appears once in the last block). So, 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place within each 100-page block. So, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 pages, and the same for 8. Now, the book has 488 pages, which is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). Wait, no, actually, 488 is 4*100 + 88, so it's 4 full hundreds and then 88 pages. So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times. So, that's 4*10 = 40 for each digit so far. Now, the remaining 88 pages are from 401 to 488. Let me check the tens digits in this range.\n\nFrom 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 481-490, but since we stop at 488, it's up to 488). So, let's see: in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? From 440-449, the tens digit is 4. That's 10 times. Similarly, how many times does 8 appear? From 480-488, the tens digit is 8. That's 9 times because from 480 to 488 is 9 pages (480, 481,...,488). Wait, but 480 is included, so that's 9 pages where the tens digit is 8. So, in the tens place, in the last 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times. Therefore, in the tens place overall, 4's are 40 (from the four hundreds) + 10 = 50, and 8's are 40 (from the four hundreds) + 9 = 49. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times, so the difference is 1 more 4 than 8.\n\nNow, onto the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, actually, 400-488 is part of the 400s, so the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. How about 8? Well, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, the difference here is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because the hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 onwards, right? So, from 1-399, the hundreds digit is 0, 1, 2, or 3. So, 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages. So, 4's in hundreds place: 89. 8's in hundreds place: 0. So, the difference is 89.\n\nNow, let me sum up the differences from each place.\n\nUnits place: 49 vs 49 \u2192 difference 0.\n\nTens place: 50 vs 49 \u2192 difference +1.\n\nHundreds place: 89 vs 0 \u2192 difference +89.\n\nSo, total difference is 0 + 1 + 89 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations, especially in the tens place. From 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 times. And for 8, it's from 480-488, which is 9 times. So, yes, that's correct. So, 10 vs 9, so +1. And hundreds place is 89 vs 0, so +89. So, total is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I was calculating the units place, I considered 488 pages as 48 full tens and 8 pages, but actually, 488 pages would be 48 full hundreds? Wait no, 488 is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 pages from 401-488. So, in each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. So, four hundreds would be 4*10=40 each. Then, in the last 88 pages, as I calculated, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times. So, total tens place: 40+10=50 for 4, 40+9=49 for 8. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, that's correct.\n\nUnits place: Each 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once. So, 488 pages is 48 full tens and 8 pages. So, 48*1=48 for each digit, plus in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So, total units place: 48+1=49 for each digit. So, difference is 0.\n\nSo, adding up the differences: tens place +1, hundreds place +89, total difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For example, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times 4 appears. And 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So, yes, 89 more 4's.\n\nIn the tens place, 50 vs 49, so +1.\n\nUnits place, same, so no difference.\n\nSo, total is 89 +1 =90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to 8's. \n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once.\n   - 488 pages = 48 full sets of 10 pages + 8 extra pages.\n   - 48 * 1 = 48 for each digit.\n   - In the last 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49 for each digit. Difference: 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each 100 pages, each digit (4 and 8) appears 10 times in the tens place.\n   - 488 pages = 4 full hundreds + 88 pages.\n   - 4 * 10 = 40 for each digit.\n   - In 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4; 40 + 9 = 49 for 8. Difference: +1.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 never appears. Difference: +89.\n\nAdding the differences: 0 (units) + 1 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Page numbers start at 1 and go up to 488, so each page is just a single number, right? So, I'm going to have to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times 8 appears, then subtract the two to find the difference.\n\nMaybe I should tackle each digit place separately, like units place and tens place, because the number of times a digit appears in each place might be different. Let me try that approach.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles through 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 appears once. So, for example, from 1 to 10, 4 appears in 4 and 8 appears in 8. So, in each block of 10, both digits appear once. But wait, the problem is up to 488, which isn't a multiple of 10. So, I'll have to calculate how many complete blocks of 10 there are and then handle the remaining numbers.\n\nWait, maybe I should calculate how many times each digit appears in the units place first. Let me try that.\n\nTotal number of pages is 488. So, the number of complete blocks of 10 is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, there are 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Then, there are 8 remaining numbers from 481 to 488. Let me check: 480 is the last number of the 48th block, so 481 to 488 is 8 numbers. Now, in these remaining 8 numbers, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 4 appear here? Yes, at 484. And 8 appears at 488. So, in the units place, in the incomplete block, 4 appears once and 8 appears once.\n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 48 blocks * 1 = 48, plus 1 in the incomplete block, total 49.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: 48 * 1 = 48, plus 1, total 49.\n\nHmm, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So, the difference here is zero. That's interesting.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. This might be a bit trickier. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, for example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, up to 9 for 90-99. So, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred.\n\nWait, but in our case, the book has 488 pages, so it's 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, maybe I should break it down into hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider each digit place separately. So, for the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's think.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there up to 488? Well, 440-449 is the last one before 488. So, that's five ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488, so that's fine.\n\nSimilarly, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? It appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers, right? So, 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times that 8 appears in the tens place.\n\nWait, but hold on, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total 49 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times. So, the difference here is 50 - 49 = 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but I should make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the ranges for 8 in the tens place:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9\n\nYes, that's 10*4 +9 = 49.\n\nSo, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times. So, 50 - 49 = 1 more 4 in the tens place.\n\nNow, what about the hundreds place? Hmm, in the hundreds place, digits go from 1 to 4, since the book is 488 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but that seems like a big difference. Let me make sure I'm correct here. The hundreds digit is only 1, 2, 3, or 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, yes, 8 appears 0 times there, while 4 appears 89 times.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n- Units place: 4 appears 49 times, 8 appears 49 times. Difference: 0\n- Tens place: 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times. Difference: +1\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times. Difference: +89\n\nSo, total difference is 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Wait, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, right? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nAnd 8 never appears in the hundreds place, so that's correct.\n\nNow, let me check the tens place again. 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\n8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 ranges, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each, plus the last 8 pages (481-488) contribute one 4 (484) and one 8 (488), so total 49 each. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n- Units: 0 difference\n- Tens: +1\n- Hundreds: +89\nTotal: 0 +1 +89=90.\n\nSo, 4's are printed 90 times more than 8's.\n\nWait, but I feel like that's a lot. Let me just think again. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, which is a big chunk. 8 doesn't appear there at all. So, that's a big difference right there.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, inclusive. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1=89. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nAnd 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800 to 899, but since the book only goes up to 488, that's not applicable. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, the difference from the hundreds place is 89, which is the main contributor.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nWait, no, wait, that's not necessary. Because the question is asking how many more 4's than 8's, so I can just calculate the difference per digit place and add them up.\n\nWait, but maybe I should calculate the total number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract.\n\nLet me try that approach to confirm.\n\nTotal number of 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89=188.\n\nTotal number of 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nYes, that's consistent with my previous calculation. So, 4's are printed 90 times more than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the units place. I thought that in each block of 10, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place, and since there are 48 full blocks, that's 48 each, plus the last 8 pages (481-488) contribute one 4 and one 8. So, 48+1=49 for both. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me count the number of 4's and 8's in the units place manually for a small range to see if my method is correct.\n\nFor example, from 1 to 20:\n\n- Units digits: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0.\n\nSo, 4 appears at 4 and 14, so twice. 8 appears at 8 and 18, so twice. So, in 20 pages, units place has 2 each. So, per 10 pages, 1 each, so 20 pages would have 2 each, which matches. So, my method seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, from 1-100, 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89). So, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my approach is correct, so the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me check the total number of digits printed. Since it's a 488-page book, the total number of digits is calculated as follows:\n\n- Pages 1-9: 1 digit each, 9 pages, so 9 digits.\n- Pages 10-99: 2 digits each, 90 pages, so 180 digits.\n- Pages 100-488: 3 digits each, 488 - 99 = 389 pages, so 389 *3=1167 digits.\nTotal digits: 9 + 180 +1167=1356 digits.\n\nWait, but I don't know if that's necessary for the problem, but just to see if 188+98=286 digits, which is less than 1356, so that seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check the total number of 4's and 8's another way, but I think the per-digit place analysis is solid.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Units Place Analysis:**\n   - Each block of 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) contains exactly one '4' and one '8' in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks of 10 in 480 pages (48 \u00d7 10 = 480).\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) contribute one '4' (484) and one '8' (488).\n   - Total '4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total '8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Difference in units place: 49 - 49 = 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place Analysis:**\n   - The digit '4' appears in the tens place for the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range has 10 numbers, so 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 '4's.\n   - The digit '8' appears in the tens place for the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The last range has 9 numbers (480-488).\n   - Total '8's in tens place: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n   - Difference in tens place: 50 - 49 = 1.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place Analysis:**\n   - The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - The digit '8' does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.\n   - Total '4's in hundreds place: 89.\n   - Total '8's in hundreds place: 0.\n   - Difference in hundreds place: 89 - 0 = 89.\n\n4. **Total Difference:**\n   - Summing the differences from each place: 0 (units) + 1 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8'.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should look at each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nLet me start by understanding how many times each digit from 0 to 9 appears in each place. So, for a book with 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. Each page number is either a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. \n\nI guess the first step is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each place (units, tens, hundreds) and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. Units place: The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, it's 48 full cycles of 10, which gives 48 occurrences. But wait, the last partial cycle is from 481 to 488, which includes 488, but the units digit 4 would be at 484. So, that's 48 times in the units place.\n\nWait, actually, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48 times because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full times, and the 48th occurrence is at 484, which is within 488. So, yes, 48 times.\n\n2. Tens place: The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For each block of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each full hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so 4 times 10 is 40. Now, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 440-449. So, that's another 10. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The hundreds place is only for three-digit numbers, so from 1-99, there's no hundreds digit. So, from 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, and so on. So, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, that's correct, 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. Units place: Similar to 4, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full times, but wait, does the last partial cycle include an 8? The last page is 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, the units digit 8 appears 49 times because 488 is included. Wait, let me check: 8, 18, 28,..., 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. How many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488. So, 8 + 10(n-1) \u2264 488 \u2192 10(n-1) \u2264 480 \u2192 n-1 \u2264 48 \u2192 n \u2264 49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. Tens place: Similar to 4, but let's see. The tens digit is 8 in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block contributes 10 numbers. How many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). In each, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Now, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, let me confirm: From 1-400, each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 8, so 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481,...,488). So, yes, 9 more, making it 49.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 times.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the units place for 8. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? The numbers are 8,18,28,...,488. The last term is 488, which is included. So, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1= 48 +1=49. So, yes, 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, as I thought, 49 times.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 +49=98.\n\nWait, but earlier, for 4's, I had 187, and for 8's, 98. So, the difference is 187 -98=89.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, for 4's:\n\n- Units: 48 times\n- Tens: 50 times\n- Hundreds: 89 times\nTotal: 48+50=98, 98+89=187.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, 187-98=89.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check that again. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers, so 89 times. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the tens place for 8's. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, in the tens place, it's 40 (from the first four hundreds) plus 9, making 49. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, units place for 8's is 49, as 8 appears once every 10 numbers, and the last one is at 488, so 49 times.\n\nSo, the total 8's are 98, and 4's are 187, so the difference is 89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the hundreds place for 4's would be 89, which is a significant number. So, maybe the answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly for the units and tens places.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full times, but wait, the last one is at 484, which is within 488, so that's 48 times. Wait, but 488 is 48*10 + 8, so the 48th multiple is 480, so 484 is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times in units.\n\n- Tens: For each hundred, 10 times. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) give 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40+10=50.\n\n- Hundreds: 89 times.\n\nTotal: 48+50+89=187.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49 times, as 488 is included.\n\n- Tens: 49 times, as 480-488 is 9 numbers, plus 40 from the first four hundreds.\n\n- Hundreds: 0.\n\nTotal: 98.\n\nSo, 187-98=89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because 89 seems like a lot. Maybe I should check with a smaller example to see if my method is correct.\n\nLet's take a book with, say, 20 pages. How many 4's and 8's?\n\nPage numbers 1-20.\n\nCount of 4's:\n\n- Units: 4,14 \u2192 2 times.\n\n- Tens: 40-49, but since we only go to 20, none in the tens place.\n\n- Hundreds: none.\n\nTotal 4's: 2.\n\nCount of 8's:\n\n- Units:8,18 \u2192 2 times.\n\n- Tens: none.\n\n- Hundreds: none.\n\nTotal 8's:2.\n\nDifference: 2-2=0. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nAnother example: 30 pages.\n\n4's:\n\n- Units:4,14,24 \u21923.\n\n- Tens:40-49, but only up to 30, so none.\n\nTotal 4's:3.\n\n8's:\n\n- Units:8,18 \u21922.\n\n- Tens: none.\n\nTotal 8's:2.\n\nDifference:3-2=1.\n\nSo, in 30 pages, 4's appear once more than 8's.\n\nWait, so in 30 pages, according to my method, units for 4's:3, tens:0, hundreds:0. Units for 8's:2, tens:0, hundreds:0. So, 3-2=1. That seems correct.\n\nAnother test: 100 pages.\n\n4's:\n\n- Units:10 (4,14,...,94).\n\n- Tens:10 (40-49).\n\n- Hundreds:0.\n\nTotal:20.\n\n8's:\n\n- Units:10 (8,18,...,98).\n\n- Tens:10 (80-89).\n\n- Hundreds:0.\n\nTotal:20.\n\nDifference:0.\n\nWait, so in 100 pages, 4's and 8's appear the same number of times, which makes sense because they're both single digits and each digit appears equally in each place up to 100.\n\nWait, but in 100 pages, the hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's there. So, yes, 20 each.\n\nWait, but in my problem, the book has 488 pages, which is more than 100, so the hundreds digit comes into play for 4's but not for 8's. That's why 4's are more.\n\nWait, maybe another test: 500 pages.\n\n4's:\n\n- Units:50 (4,14,...,494).\n\n- Tens:50 (40-49, 140-149,...,440-449).\n\n- Hundreds:100 (400-499).\n\nTotal:50+50+100=200.\n\n8's:\n\n- Units:50 (8,18,...,498).\n\n- Tens:50 (80-89,180-189,...,480-489).\n\n- Hundreds:0 (since 500 is the limit, 800-899 isn't included).\n\nTotal:50+50=100.\n\nDifference:200-100=100.\n\nWait, but in 500 pages, 4's are 200, 8's are 100, so 100 more 4's.\n\nWait, but in my problem, the book is 488 pages, so it's less than 500. So, maybe I need to adjust for that.\n\nWait, in 488 pages, the hundreds digit for 4's is from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, not 100. So, that's where the difference comes in.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place in 8's, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only up to 488, so 9 numbers instead of 10.\n\nSo, perhaps my initial calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because when I did the 100-page example, the counts were equal, but in 488, it's different. Maybe I should try another example to see.\n\nLet's try 100 pages again, but using my method:\n\n4's:\n\n- Units:10.\n\n- Tens:10.\n\n- Hundreds:0.\n\nTotal:20.\n\n8's:\n\n- Units:10.\n\n- Tens:10.\n\n- Hundreds:0.\n\nTotal:20.\n\nDifference:0.\n\nGood.\n\nNow, try 450 pages.\n\n4's:\n\n- Units:45 (since 450/10=45).\n\n- Tens:45 (each hundred contributes 10, so 4 hundreds would be 40, but 450 is the limit, so in the last hundred (401-450), the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40+10=50.\n\nWait, no, wait: from 1-400, the tens digit 4 appears 4 times 10=40. Then, 440-449 in 401-450 is another 10, so total 50.\n\nHundreds digit: 400-450, which is 51 numbers (450-400+1=51). So, hundreds digit 4 appears 51 times.\n\nTotal 4's:45+50+51=146.\n\n8's:\n\n- Units:45 (8,18,...,448,458? Wait, 450 is the limit, so up to 448.\n\nWait, 450 divided by 10 is 45, so units digit 8 appears 45 times.\n\nTens digit: Each hundred contributes 10, so 4 hundreds: 40. Then, in 401-450, the tens digit 8 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens digit 8's:40+10=50.\n\nHundreds digit: 800-899 isn't included, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's:45+50=95.\n\nDifference:146-95=51.\n\nWait, but according to my method, in 450 pages, 4's are 146, 8's are 95, difference 51. That seems plausible.\n\nWait, but in 450 pages, the hundreds digit 4 appears from 400-450, which is 51 numbers, so 51 times. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, in my problem, 488 pages, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times, which is 488-400+1=89.\n\nSo, going back, I think my initial calculation is correct: 187 4's and 98 8's, difference of 89.\n\nWait, but let me check the units digit for 8's again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens digit 8's: in each hundred, 10 times, so 4 hundreds give 40, and in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 40+9=49.\n\nSo, 49+49=98.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits:48, Tens:50, Hundreds:89, total 187.\n\nSo, 187-98=89.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, this occurs 48 times (as 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, truncating to 48 full cycles).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks of 10 (e.g., 40-49). There are 4 full hundreds contributing 10 each (40) and an additional 10 in 440-449, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (including 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks of 10 (e.g., 80-89). There are 4 full hundreds contributing 10 each (40) and 9 additional times in 480-488, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Page numbers go from 1 to 488, so each page has a single number, right? So, each digit in these numbers can be 0 through 9, but since we're starting at 1, the first digit might not always be there, but the last digit could be anything.\n\nWait, actually, no. Each page number is a three-digit number because 488 is a three-digit number. But wait, pages 1 through 9 are single-digit, 10 through 99 are two-digit, and 100 through 488 are three-digit. So, maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That makes sense because the count of each digit depends on their position.\n\nSo, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each place (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for the digit 8. Then, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's in each place.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times, and then in the extra 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digit is 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Each 10 numbers contribute one 4, so 48 times for 480, but then from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once more. So yes, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every block of 100 numbers. So, in each 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. How many complete hundreds are there in 488? Well, 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So that's 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for how many numbers? From 440 to 449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 times. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but wait, 401-488 is 88 pages. So, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but wait, 488 is the last page). So, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except maybe the last one. Wait, but 401-488 is 88 pages, which is 8 full tens (0-7) and then 8 more pages (481-488). Wait, no, actually, each ten is 10 pages, so 401-410 is the first ten with tens digit 0, 411-420 is tens digit 1, and so on up to 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the last ten is only 8 pages (481-488). So, in the tens place, the digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is a full ten, so 10 times. So, yes, 40 from the first 400 pages, plus 10 from 440-449, so 50 total.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (including both 400 and 488). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but 400 to 488 is 89 pages? Let me check: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. Yes, that's correct. So, 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, each 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many 8's in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once more. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nWait, that's the same as 4's in units place. Hmm, but wait, maybe not. Wait, no, 4's had 49, and 8's also have 49? That can't be right because in the hundreds place, 8 doesn't appear as much. Wait, no, let me check.\n\nWait, no, in the units place, 8 appears 49 times, same as 4. But let me see:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, so 48 times, plus in the last partial cycle (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the tens place for 8's. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, in each 100, 10 times. How many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). So, 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\nThen, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in the tens place, 8 appears in the 480-489 range, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480-488. Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we stop at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the remaining 88 pages.\n\nWait, but wait, in the tens place, each 10 numbers contribute one 8, so from 401-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's see: 480-489 is the next occurrence, but we only go up to 488, so that's 9 numbers (480-488), so the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 (from the first 400) + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait, 401-488 is 88 pages. So, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-489). But since we stop at 488, the last ten is 480-488, which is 9 pages, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times. So, yes, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place for 8's. The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nWait, that makes sense because 488 is less than 800, so the hundreds digit can only be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 times.\n\nWait, so 4's appeared 188 times, and 8's appeared 98 times. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big difference. Let me go through each digit place again for both 4's and 8's.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But I'm a bit surprised because I thought maybe the hundreds place would have more 4's, but 89 is a lot. Let me check the hundreds place again.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nFor 8's, in the hundreds place, none, so 0.\n\nIn the tens place, for 8's, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, 40 from the first 400 pages, plus 9, so 49.\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nSo, yes, 98 total for 8's.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 4's. Let me check that again.\n\nFor 4's in the tens place:\n\n- Each 100 numbers contribute 10 times 4 in the tens place. So, 4 times 10 = 40.\n\nThen, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 50 in the tens place for 4's.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times, plus 40 from the first 400, so 49.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nSo, I think my initial calculation is correct. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again for both digits.\n\nFor 4's in units place:\n\n- 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48 times.\n\nThen, in the last partial ten (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly for 8's in units place:\n\n- 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48 times.\n\nIn the last partial ten, 481-488, units digits 1-8, so 8 appears once. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nSo, I think I've double-checked all the parts, and my calculations seem accurate. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 4.\n   - 488 / 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 times in full tens.\n   - Last partial ten (481-488) adds 1 more.\n   - Total: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers contribute 10 fours.\n   - 400 pages contribute 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - 440-449 adds 10 more.\n   - Total: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 400-488: 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 8.\n   - 488 / 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 times in full tens.\n   - Last partial ten adds 1 more.\n   - Total: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers contribute 10 eights.\n   - 400 pages contribute 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - 480-488 adds 9 more.\n   - Total: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 800+ pages don't exist; total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** 90 more 4's than 8's are printed.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) separately and then do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by understanding the range of page numbers. The book has pages from 1 to 488, so we're dealing with three-digit numbers. I can separate the counting based on the units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 pages (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has one 4. So, the total number of 4's in the units place would be the number of such blocks. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so that's 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4. But wait, the last block is 481-490, but our book stops at 488, so from 481 to 488, the units digit 4 appears once (at 484). So, actually, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 full times plus one more at 484, making it 49 times? Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, so the 48th block is 481-490, but we only go up to 488. So, in the units place, how many 4's are there? Let's see: from 1-488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full times, but we have to check if 484 is within the range. Yes, 484 is less than 488, so that's another 4. So, total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49? Wait, no, that might not be correct because 488 is the last page, so the last block is 481-490, but we only go up to 488, so in that last block, the units digit 4 appears once at 484. So, from 1-480, there are 480/10 = 48 times, and then from 481-488, one more at 484. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 1-480, every 10 pages have one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then from 481-488, the units digit 4 is at 484, so that's one more. So, total units place 4's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the digit 4 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block has 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488?\n\nFrom 1-488, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, but the first page is 1, so pages 1-9 are single-digit, but when considering the tens place, pages 1-9 have the tens digit as 0. So, starting from 10 onwards, the tens digit becomes relevant.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n- For the tens digit 4, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n\nEach of these blocks contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Now, how many complete blocks are there up to 488?\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers, all within 488.\n- 140-149: 10 numbers, within 488.\n- 240-249: 10 numbers, within 488.\n- 340-349: 10 numbers, within 488.\n- 440-449: 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 5*10=50.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me check: 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 another 10, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each with 10 4's in the tens place, totaling 50.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so the next block after 440-449 would be 540-549, which is beyond 488, so we don't include that. So yes, 5 blocks, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but I think I might be missing something. Let me think again. The tens digit is 4 in the ranges:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10\n- 240-249: 10\n- 340-349: 10\n- 440-449: 10\n\nSo that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 4's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nWait, but wait: 400 is the first page with 4 in the hundreds place, and 488 is the last. So, from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 pages. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89.\n\nLet me calculate that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nAgain, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8. But we need to check if 488 is included. Since 488 ends with an 8, that's another occurrence. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: from 1-480, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Then from 481-488, the units digit 8 is at 488, so that's one more. So, total units place 8's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the block. Let's count how many complete blocks and partial blocks we have.\n\nEach block where the tens digit is 8 contributes 10 8's in the tens place. So:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, all within 488.\n- 180-189: 10 numbers, within 488.\n- 280-289: 10 numbers, within 488.\n- 380-389: 10 numbers, within 488.\n- 480-489: but our book stops at 488, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears 9 times here.\n\nSo, for the first four blocks, each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, and the last block contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, yes, 4*10 +9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. That's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, so 4*10=40 plus 9=49. So, yes, 49.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's:98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the 4's in the tens place. Let me go back.\n\nEarlier, I thought that for the tens place, the digit 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 5 blocks *10=50.\n\nBut wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 5 blocks, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's in the tens place, we have 5 blocks but the last one only contributes 9, so 49.\n\nSo, 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for 4's was 89, but let me check that again.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 4's.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, 8's:98, difference:90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have overcounted the 4's in the hundreds place. Let me check: 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, right? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89.\n\nWait, but let me think about another approach. Maybe using a formula or a more systematic way to count the digits.\n\nFor any digit d in a certain position (units, tens, hundreds), the count can be determined by looking at higher digits, current digit, and lower digits.\n\nBut maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider each digit place separately and calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears: floor(488/10) =48, plus if the remainder is >=4, add 1. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with remainder 8, which is >=4, so add 1. So, 48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly for 8: floor(488/10)=48, remainder 8. Since remainder >=8, add 1. So, 48+1=49.\n\nSo, units place: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor tens digit, we can think of it as:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 100, and then the remainder.\n\nEach group of 100 contributes 10 times the digit in the tens place for each digit from 0-9.\n\nSo, for digit d in the tens place, the count is:\n\nhigher = floor(number / 100)\n\ncurrent = floor((number / 10) mod 10)\n\nlower = number mod 10\n\ncount = higher * 10\n\nif current > d: count +=10\n\nif current ==d: count += lower +1\n\nBut maybe that's a formula I can use.\n\nWait, let me try applying this formula for digit 4 in the tens place.\n\nNumber is 488.\n\nhigher = floor(488 / 100) =4\n\ncurrent = floor((488 /10) mod 10)= floor(48.8 mod10)=8\n\nlower=488 mod10=8\n\nSo, for digit 4:\n\ncount = higher *10 =4*10=40\n\nsince current (8) >4, add 10, so 40+10=50.\n\nSo, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8 in the tens place:\n\nhigher=4\n\ncurrent=8\n\nlower=8\n\ncount= higher*10=40\n\nsince current=8, which is equal to d=8, so count += lower +1=8+1=9\n\nso total count=40+9=49.\n\nSo, that confirms the earlier counts: 50 4's and 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nFor digit 4:\n\nhigher= floor(488/1000)=0\n\ncurrent= floor(488/100)=4\n\nlower=488 mod100=88\n\nSo, count= higher*100=0\n\nsince current >=4, we add lower +1=88+1=89.\n\nSo, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nFor digit 8 in the hundreds place:\n\nhigher=0\n\ncurrent=4\n\nlower=88\n\nsince current <8, count= higher*100=0\n\nso, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: units(49)+tens(50)+hundreds(89)=188\n\nTotal 8's: units(49)+tens(49)+hundreds(0)=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so the difference is 90.\n\nBut earlier, I thought maybe 90, but I want to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.\n\nLet me cross-verify.\n\nUnits place: both 4 and 8 appear 49 times.\n\nTens place:4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nHundreds place:4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for 4's was 89, but let me check again: from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any mistake in the tens place calculation.\n\nFor the tens digit 4:\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nhigher=4, current=8, lower=8\n\nsince current>4, count=4*10 +10=50.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nFor tens digit 8:\n\nhigher=4, current=8, lower=8\n\nsince current=8, count=4*10 + (8+1)=49.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, yes, the counts are accurate.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 4.  \n   - Total blocks: 48 (from 1-480) + 1 (484 in 481-488) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - Every 100 numbers have 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.  \n   - Blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.  \n   - Total: 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - Pages 400-488 each have a 4 in the hundreds place.  \n   - Total: 89 pages.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 8.  \n   - Total blocks: 48 (from 1-480) + 1 (488) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - Every 100 numbers have 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.  \n   - Blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488 (9 occurrences).  \n   - Total: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - No pages in 1-488 have 8 in the hundreds place.  \n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should look at the digits in the units place and the tens place separately because each digit can contribute to the count of 4's and 8's.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every set of ten pages, like 1-10, 11-20, and so on, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So in each of these sets, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, right? For example, in 1-10, it's page 4, and in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once in each set, like page 8, 18, 28, etc.\n\nNow, since the book has 488 pages, let me see how many complete sets of ten there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten and an extra 8 pages. So, in each of these 48 sets, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, that would give me 48 fours and 48 eights from the units place.\n\nBut wait, there are also those extra 8 pages beyond the 480th page. Pages 481 to 488. Let me check the units digits here. From 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial set, the units digit 4 appears once at 484, and the units digit 8 appears once at 488. So that adds one more 4 and one more 8. So, in total, the units place contributes 48 + 1 = 49 fours and 48 + 1 = 49 eights.\n\nNow, I should also check the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, in the 40-49 range, the tens digit is 4 for all ten pages. Similarly, in the 80-89 range, the tens digit is 8 for all ten pages.\n\nLet me figure out how many times 4 appears in the tens place. From 40 to 49, that's ten pages where the tens digit is 4. Similarly, from 140-149, 240-249, and so on, up to 440-449, each of these decades contributes ten 4's in the tens place. Let me count how many such decades there are in 488 pages.\n\nStarting from 40-49, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's five sets of ten where the tens digit is 4. Each set contributes ten 4's, so that's 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the tens digit being 8, it's similar. From 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that set. So that's five sets as well. Each set contributes ten 8's in the tens place. So that's 5 x 10 = 50 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is only nine pages, right? So in the tens place, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all nine pages, so that's nine 8's. Hmm, so maybe I overcounted by one. Because 480-489 would be ten pages, but we only have up to 488, which is nine pages. So perhaps the 480-489 set only contributes nine 8's in the tens place. So that would mean instead of 5 x 10 = 50 eights, it's actually 4 x 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, let's list the decades where the tens digit is 8:\n\n- 80-89: 10 pages, so 10 eights.\n- 180-189: 10 pages, 10 eights.\n- 280-289: 10 pages, 10 eights.\n- 380-389: 10 pages, 10 eights.\n- 480-489: But since the book ends at 488, this is only pages 480 to 488, which is 9 pages. So the tens digit is 8 for all nine of these pages.\n\nSo that's 4 sets of ten (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 4 x 10 = 40 eights, plus 9 eights from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, so that means the tens place contributes 50 fours (from 40-49, 140-149, etc.) and 49 eights (from 80-89, etc., and 480-488). So, in the tens place, we have 50 fours and 49 eights.\n\nNow, adding up the counts from both units and tens places:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 = 99\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98\n\nWait, but that would mean there's one more 4 than 8. But let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let's go back to the units place. I had 48 complete sets of ten, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), I found one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488). So, units place: 48 +1 =49 fours, and 48 +1=49 eights. That seems correct.\n\nNow, tens place: For 4's, I have 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five sets, each contributing ten 4's, so 5 x 10 = 50 fours. That's correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, I have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four sets are complete, each contributing ten 8's, so 4 x 10 = 40. The last set, 480-488, has nine pages, each with 8 in the tens place, so 9 more. So, 40 +9=49 eights in the tens place. That's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) =99\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98\nDifference: 99 -98=1\n\nWait, so that means there's one more 4 than 8. But I thought maybe it would be more. Did I miss something?\n\nWait, let me check if there's any hundreds place where 4 or 8 appears. Since the book is 488 pages, the hundreds digit is 4 from page 100 to 488. So, pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so no 4 or 8 there. Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, same. 300-399: 3. 400-488: hundreds digit is 4. So, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 pages. So that's 89 more 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nOh, I completely forgot about the hundreds place! That's a big oversight. So, the hundreds digit contributes 89 fours. So, that's a significant number.\n\nWait, so let me adjust my counts. So, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, each page has a hundreds digit of 4. The number of pages from 400 to 488 inclusive is 488 - 400 +1=89 pages. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, does the hundreds digit ever have an 8? Well, 800 would be needed for that, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding that to the previous counts:\n\nTotal 4's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal 4's=49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal 8's=49+49+0=98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot more. So, I had initially missed the hundreds place, which contributes 89 fours. So, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, let me confirm this again because I initially thought only about units and tens, but the hundreds place adds a significant number.\n\nSo, let's go through each digit place again.\n\nUnits place:\n- 488 pages, so 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n- 48 fours, 48 eights.\n- Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488).\n- So, units place: 49 fours, 49 eights.\n\nTens place:\n- For 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five sets, each contributing ten 4's, so 50 fours.\n- For 8's: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four sets are complete, each with ten 8's, so 40 eights. The last set, 480-488, has nine pages, so nine more 8's, totaling 49 eights.\n\nHundreds place:\n- From 400-488, each page has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 fours.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal 4's=49+50+89=188\n\n8's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal 8's=49+49=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the hundreds place count. From 400 to 488 inclusive, how many pages is that? 488 -400 +1=89 pages. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that every page from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nI think that's the right answer now.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, and hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each set of 10 pages (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) contains one '4' and one '8'.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 480 pages, contributing 48 '4's and 48 '8's.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one '4' (484) and one '8' (488).\n   - **Total in units place:** 49 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - '4' appears in the tens place for pages 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each set contributes 10 '4's, totaling 50 '4's.\n   - '8' appears in the tens place for pages 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four sets contribute 40 '8's, and the last set (480-488) contributes 9 '8's.\n   - **Total in tens place:** 50 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 each have a '4' in the hundreds place, totaling 89 '4's.\n   - No '8's appear in the hundreds place within 488 pages.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 89 '4's and 0 '8's.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should look at each digit place separately\u2014like units, tens, hundreds\u2014and count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nLet me start by understanding the range of page numbers. The book has pages from 1 to 488, so the page numbers are three-digit numbers at most, but some are two-digit or even one-digit. So, I might need to consider each digit place separately for each page number.\n\nI guess the plan is to count the number of 4's in the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place, and then do the same for 8's. Then, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find how many more 4's there are.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same for 8. But since the book ends at 488, I need to check if 488 is a complete block or not.\n\nWait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and an extra 8 pages. So, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times, except for the last partial block where the units digits go from 0 to 8. So, for the units place, 4 appears 48 times, and 8 appears 48 times as well, plus one more time in the partial block because 8 is included. So, units place: 4's = 48, 8's = 49. Hmm, wait, no, because the partial block is 481 to 488, so the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once, and 8 appears once in the partial block. So, total units place: 4's = 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 488 is included, so maybe I need to adjust. Let me think again.\n\nActually, from page 1 to 480, there are 480 pages, which is 48 blocks of 10. Each block contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 times each. Then, from 481 to 488, that's 8 pages. The units digits here are 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, total units place: 4's = 48 + 1 = 49, 8's = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has equal numbers of 4's and 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every block of 100. So, for example, in pages 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8.\n\nBut our book goes up to 488, so how many complete hundreds are there? Pages 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488. So, that's five blocks. Wait, no, 401-488 is only 88 pages, not a full 100. So, let me correct that.\n\nFrom 1-400, there are four complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each of these has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, that's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 times each.\n\nThen, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 pages where the tens digit is 4. Then, 8 appears in 480-488, but 480-488 is 9 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 pages because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place from 401-488, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place: 4's = 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50. 8's = 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 401-488) = 49.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check again. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for tens digit 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 pages. For tens digit 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages because 488 is the last page, so 480, 481, ..., 488 is 9 pages, not 10. So, yes, 10 for 4's and 9 for 8's in the tens place from 401-488.\n\nSo, total tens place: 4's = 40 + 10 = 50, 8's = 40 + 9 = 49. So, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, 300-399 is hundreds digit 3, and 400-488 is hundreds digit 4.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400 to 488. How many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. Therefore, 4's in the hundreds place: 89 times. 8's in the hundreds place: 0 times because the book ends at 488, which is still in the 400s, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nUnits place:\n4's: 49\n8's: 49\n\nTens place:\n4's: 50\n8's: 49\n\nHundreds place:\n4's: 89\n8's: 0\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49. That seems correct because from 1-480, each digit appears 48 times, and from 481-488, each appears once more.\n\nTens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 49. Let me verify:\n\nFrom 1-400, each digit appears 40 times in the tens place. From 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0. Correct because 400-488 is 89 pages, all with hundreds digit 4.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to miscount, especially in the hundreds place. Let me double-check the hundreds place. From page 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 pages, so 89 times. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 481-488 includes 484, so that's one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n\nWait, another thought: When counting the units place from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear? For every 10 pages, it's once, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (at 484). So, total units 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Same for 8's: 48 times from the full tens, plus once in the last partial set (at 488), so 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, from 1-400, each hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place, so 4 times 10 = 40 each. Then, from 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, but I'm thinking, is 90 the correct answer? It seems like a lot, but considering that in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, which is a significant contribution. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately and then sum them up.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) + (if the last partial set includes 4, add 1). So, floor(488/10) = 48, and since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so add 1. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's: floor(488/10) + (if the last partial set includes 8, add 1). So, same as above, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100) * 10 + extra in the last partial hundred.\n\nfloor(488/100) = 4, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nNow, the last partial hundred is 401-488. The tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 pages, so add 10. So total 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in tens place: floor(488/100) * 10 = 40.\n\nIn the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so add 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: if the hundreds digit is 4, then the number of pages is from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages, so 89.\n\nNumber of 8's: since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so 0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think this confirms the earlier calculation. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just check if I'm not overcounting any digits. For example, in page 444, the digit 4 appears three times, so each occurrence is counted separately in units, tens, and hundreds. Similarly, page 488 has two 8's, but in our counting, each digit is considered separately, so 488 contributes one 8 in the tens place and one 8 in the hundreds place? Wait, no, 488 is 4-8-8, so the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit is 8, and the units digit is 8. So, in our counting, the hundreds digit 4 is counted once, the tens digit 8 is counted once, and the units digit 8 is counted once. So, each digit is counted separately, so 488 contributes one 4 and two 8's. Wait, but in our earlier counting, we counted the hundreds digit 4 as 89 times, which includes all the 4's in the hundreds place, including 488.\n\nWait, but in our hundreds place count, we counted 89 times 4, which is correct because from 400-488, each page has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 pages. So, each of those pages contributes one 4 in the hundreds place, regardless of the other digits.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, 488 contributes one 8, and in the units place, it contributes another 8. So, in total, 488 contributes two 8's, but in our counting, we counted each occurrence separately. So, in the tens place, we have 49 8's, which includes the 8 in 488. Similarly, in the units place, we have 49 8's, which includes the 8 in 488. So, 488 is correctly accounted for twice, once in tens and once in units.\n\nWait, but in our earlier count, the tens place 8's were 49, which includes 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times in the tens place. Similarly, units place 8's are 49, which includes 488's units digit. So, 488 is correctly counted as contributing one 8 in the tens place and one in the units place, making two 8's, which are both included in the total 8's count of 98.\n\nSo, I think the counting is accurate.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Then, subtract the two to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by understanding how page numbers are formed. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the first page is 1, the last is 488, and in between, we have all the numbers from 2 up to 487.\n\nI think I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Because the number of times a digit appears in each place might vary. So, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's in the units place, then in the tens place, and then in the hundreds place, and add them all up. Similarly, do the same for 8's and then compare.\n\nStarting with the digit 4. Let's look at the units place first. How often does 4 appear in the units place from 1 to 488? Well, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10 numbers, 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. But wait, 484 is within 488, so that's okay.\n\nSo, how many such blocks are there? From 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. Divided by 10, that's 48 full blocks and then 8 extra numbers (since 488 = 48*10 + 8). In each full block, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear again in the units place here. So, total 4's in units place are 48.\n\nWait, but wait a second, does page 4 count as 04? No, because page numbers don't have leading zeros. So, page 4 is just '4', so in the units place, it's correct to count it as one occurrence. So, 48 times seems right.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place for the digit 4. In the tens place, 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there?\n\nFrom 1 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in 1-100, 40-49 is one block. Then 140-149 is another, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks in total, each contributing 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, 5 blocks * 10 = 50 times.\n\nWait, but wait again. The last block is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nNow, what about the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's are 187.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8. So, I need to count how many times 8 appears in the units, tens, and hundreds places from 1 to 488.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full blocks of 10 are there? 48 full blocks (since 48*10=480) and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each full block, 8 appears once, so 48 times. In the remaining 8 numbers, 481-488, the units digits are 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more (at 488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place for 8. The tens digit is 8 in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences, except maybe the last one.\n\nSo, let's count the blocks: 80-89 is one, 180-189 is two, 280-289 is three, 380-389 is four, and 480-488 is five. So, five blocks in total. Now, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 numbers, so 4 blocks * 10 = 40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, in the tens place, each number from 480 to 488 has 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 to 899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences here.\n\nSo, total 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, so 4's are 187 and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89. So, 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I was counting the tens place for 8, I considered 480-488 as a block, which is 9 numbers. So, that's correct because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, 9 occurrences there. So, 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) give 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 in the tens place. That seems right.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 occurrences. That's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place for 4. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear again. So, 48 is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the units place, 48 full blocks (480 units) and then in the last 8 numbers, 488 has 8 in the units place, so 48 +1=49.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 187, and 8's is 98. The difference is 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. When counting the hundreds place for 4, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again: 400 is the first page with 4 in the hundreds place, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nSo, yeah, I think my calculations are correct. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:** Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. With 48 full decades (480 numbers), there are 48 occurrences. The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) don't add any more 4's. Total: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are five such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 occurrences. Total: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, there are 89 numbers with 4 in the hundreds place. Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:** Every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. With 48 full decades, there are 48 occurrences. The last 8 numbers (481-488) include 488, adding one more. Total: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are five such blocks, but the last block (480-488) has 9 numbers. Total: 40 (from four full blocks) + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place. Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Maybe I should look at each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds, and so on.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every 10 pages, the digits 0 through 9 appear exactly once in the units place. So, for each set of 10 pages, there's exactly one '4' and one '8' in the units place. Now, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10, and then 8 extra pages. So, in the units place, the number of 4's would be 48, and the number of 8's would also be 48. But wait, in the last 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so the 8 appears once more. So, for units place, 4's: 48, 8's: 49. So, 4's are one less than 8's in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 pages. So, for 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 4 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, 4 times 10 = 40 times each digit appears in the tens place across 400 pages. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (from 401 to 488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Let me see: from 401-409, tens digit is 0; 410-419, it's 1; and so on up to 480-488, where the tens digit is 8. So, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place in these 88 pages? For each ten, like 410-419, the tens digit is the same for 10 pages, except maybe the last one if it's cut short. So, from 401-488, the tens digits are 0 (10 times: 401-410), 1 (10 times: 411-420), ..., up to 8 (9 times: 481-488). Wait, no, 481-488 is 8 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 pages, not 9. Hmm, so for the tens place in the last 88 pages, 0 appears 10 times, 1 appears 10 times, ..., up to 8 appearing 8 times. So, in total, for the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times (from 440-449), and the digit 8 appears 10 times (from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 times? Wait, no, 480-489 is 10 pages, but since we stop at 488, it's 9 pages. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 8. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, let me clarify: from 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490). But since we're only going up to 488, the last set is 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, the tens digit is 8 for 8 pages. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and the digit 8 appears 8 times (480-488). So, adding that to the previous 400 pages, where each digit appears 4 times in the tens place, that would be 4 times 10 = 40 for each digit, but wait, no, in the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times per hundred, so for 400 pages, that's 4 times 10 = 40 times each. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, it's 40 times from the first 400 pages, plus 10 times from 440-449, totaling 50 times. Wait, no, that can't be right because 440-449 is within the first 400 pages. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate the number of times each digit appears in the tens place up to 488. Let's see:\n\n- For the hundreds place, since we're dealing with a 488-page book, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages (from 400 to 488). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. But wait, no, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 exactly 89 times. But since we're only considering the digits 4 and 8, I need to see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place. So, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4, not 8.\n\nNow, moving back to the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages. So, in 400 pages, each digit appears 4 times in the tens place, which is 4*10=40 times. But wait, that's not quite accurate because each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, in 400 pages, each digit appears 40 times in the tens place. Now, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, for each ten, like 410-419, the tens digit is 1, and it appears 10 times. But in the last set, 481-488, the tens digit is 8, but there are only 8 pages, so 8 appears 8 times. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times in 440-449, and the digit 8 appears 8 times in 480-488. So, adding that to the 400 pages, which had 40 times each, the total for 4 in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50, and for 8, it's 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because in the first 400 pages, each digit in the tens place appears 40 times. Then, in the next 88 pages, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for each digit from 0 to 7, they appear 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 410-419 for 1, 420-429 for 2, etc.), and for 8, it's 8 times because we only go up to 488. So, for the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times in 440-449, so total 40 (from 1-400) +10=50. The digit 8 appears 10 times in 480-489, but since we only have up to 488, it's 9 times? Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 pages (480,481,...488), so the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 8 pages because 488-480=8, but actually, it's 9 pages. Hmm, so maybe I should correct that.\n\nWait, 480 is page 480, then 481, 482,... up to 488. So that's 9 pages where the tens digit is 8. So, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the last 88 pages. So, total in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 40 +9=49 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought in the first 400 pages, each digit appears 40 times in the tens place. So, for 4, it's 40 +10=50, and for 8, it's 40 +9=49. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, let's move to the hundreds place. As I thought earlier, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and 8 never appears there.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 48 +50 +89= 187\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49+49=98\n\nWait, that can't be right because 187 -98=89, which seems high. Maybe I made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Maybe I overcounted in the tens place. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me calculate the number of times each digit appears in each place separately.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nIn each set of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit 0-9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for 488 pages, there are 48 full sets of 10 (since 48*10=480), and then 8 extra pages (481-488). So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times (once per each set of 10), and in the extra 8 pages, does 4 appear? 481-488: units digits are 1-8, so 4 doesn't appear. So, units place: 4 appears 48 times, 8 appears 48 times (once per set) plus once in the extra pages (488), so 49 times.\n\nWait, so units place: 4's=48, 8's=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach digit in the tens place repeats every 100 pages. Each digit appears 10 times per 100 pages. So, for 400 pages, each digit appears 40 times in the tens place. Then, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, for each digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear in the tens place?\n\n- Digit 0: 10 times (401-410)\n- Digit 1:10 times (411-420)\n- Digit 2:10 times (421-430)\n- Digit 3:10 times (431-440)\n- Digit 4:10 times (441-450)\n- Digit 5:10 times (451-460)\n- Digit 6:10 times (461-470)\n- Digit 7:10 times (471-480)\n- Digit 8:8 times (481-488)\n\nWait, but from 481-488, that's 8 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 pages. So, in the tens place, digit 4 appears 10 times in 441-450, which is within the first 400 pages. So, in the first 400 pages, digit 4 appears 40 times in the tens place, and in the next 88 pages, it appears 10 times (from 441-450). Wait, but 441-450 is within the first 400 pages, right? Because 400 pages end at 400, so 441-450 would actually be in the next set. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that in the first 400 pages, each digit in the tens place appears 40 times. Then, in the next 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for each digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear in the tens place in these 88 pages?\n\n- 0: 10 times (401-410)\n- 1:10 times (411-420)\n- 2:10 times (421-430)\n- 3:10 times (431-440)\n- 4:10 times (441-450)\n- 5:10 times (451-460)\n- 6:10 times (461-470)\n- 7:10 times (471-480)\n- 8:8 times (481-488)\n\nSo, in the tens place, digit 4 appears 10 times in the first 400 pages, and another 10 times in the next 88 pages (441-450), so total 20 times? Wait, that doesn't make sense because the first 400 pages already include 441-450? Wait, no, 400 pages end at 400, so 441-450 would be in the 401-488 range. So, in the first 400 pages, digit 4 in the tens place appears 40 times (as each hundred has 10 occurrences, so 4 hundreds give 40). Then, in the next 88 pages, digit 4 appears another 10 times (441-450). So, total for tens place, digit 4:40 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, digit 8 in the tens place: in the first 400 pages, it's 40 times, and in the next 88 pages, it's 8 times (481-488). So, total 40 +8=48.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 49. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. So, in the tens place, digit 4:50, digit 8:48.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nDigit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (488-400+1=89). So, digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and digit 8 never appears there.\n\nNow, let's sum up:\n\nDigit 4:\n- Units:48\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:48+50+89=187\n\nDigit 8:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:48\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+48=97\n\nWait, so 187 (4's) -97 (8's)=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place for 8's was 49, tens place 48, so total 97. Hmm, maybe I should double-check the units place.\n\nUnits place: Each set of 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once. 488 pages: 48 full sets (480 pages), and 8 extra pages (481-488). So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 times, and 8 appears 48 times in the full sets, plus once in the extra pages (488), so 49 times. So, units:4=48, 8=49.\n\nTens place: As calculated, 4=50, 8=48.\n\nHundreds place:4=89,8=0.\n\nSo, total 4's:48+50+89=187\n\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97\n\nSo, 187-97=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - There are 48 full sets of 10 pages in 480 pages, contributing 48 each to 4 and 8.\n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) add one more 8.\n   - **Total**: 4's = 48, 8's = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - In the first 400 pages, each digit appears 40 times.\n   - The last 88 pages (401-488) add 10 more 4's (441-450) and 8 more 8's (481-488).\n   - **Total**: 4's = 40 + 10 = 50, 8's = 40 + 8 = 48.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488 (89 times).\n   - The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total**: 4's = 89, 8's = 0.\n\nSumming up:\n- **4's**: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187\n- **8's**: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 187 - 97 = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should look at each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds. That might make it easier to count the occurrences of each digit.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every 10 pages, the digits 0 through 9 appear exactly once in the units place. So, for example, pages 1-10 have 1 in the units place on page 1, 2 on page 2, and so on up to 0 on page 10. So, in each set of 10 pages, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in the units place. That means the number of times a particular digit, say 4, appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete sets of 10 pages in the book. \n\nWait, but the book has 488 pages. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, it's 48 complete sets, right? So, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times. But wait, that's not exactly right because the last set is only 8 pages (from 481 to 488). So, the units digits from 1 to 8 appear once more in that incomplete set. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust for that.\n\nWait, no, actually, when considering the units place, every page number from 1 to 488 will have a units digit from 0 to 9, but the last page is 488, which ends with 8. So, perhaps the units digits go up to 8 in the last partial set. Let me think again. Each complete set of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 complete sets, that's 48 fours and 48 eights. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits are 1 through 8. So, in those, 4 appears once (page 484) and 8 appears once (page 488). So, in total, the units place would have 48 + 1 = 49 fours and 48 + 1 = 49 eights. Wait, that's the same number, so maybe that's not where the difference comes from.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe I should calculate the number of times 4 appears in the units place and the number of times 8 appears, and then do the same for the tens and hundreds places, then sum them up.\n\nLet me try again. Let's consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nEach digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in the units place over a range of pages. So, for 488 pages, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, that's 48 fours and 48 eights. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So, in these, 4 appears once (page 484) and 8 appears once (page 488). So, total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49 fours and 48 + 1 = 49 eights. So, no difference in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place:\n\nThe tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for example, in pages 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (pages 1-9) to 9 (pages 90-99). Each digit appears 10 times. So, for each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, since the book has 488 pages, that's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each of these 4 hundreds, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., pages 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., pages 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n\nSo, for the tens place, in the first 400 pages, we have 4 times 10 = 40 fours and 4 times 10 = 40 eights. Now, we have 88 pages left (401-488). Let's look at the tens digits in this range. Pages 401-409 have a tens digit of 0, 410-419 have 1, 420-429 have 2, 430-439 have 3, 440-449 have 4, 450-459 have 5, 460-469 have 6, 470-479 have 7, 480-488 have 8.\n\nWait, so in the tens place, from 401-488, how many times does 4 appear? Well, in the 440-449 range, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 pages. But since we're only going up to 488, 440-449 is entirely within that range, so that's 10 fours. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488), so the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 pages because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the tens place, in the last 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 480-488 is 9 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages. So, in the tens place, the number of 4's is 10 (from 440-449) and the number of 8's is 9 (from 480-488). So, in the tens place, from 401-488, we have 10 fours and 9 eights.\n\nAdding that to the first 400 pages, which had 40 fours and 40 eights, the total in the tens place would be 40 + 10 = 50 fours and 40 + 9 = 49 eights. So, in the tens place, fours appear 50 times and eights appear 49 times. That's a difference of 1 more four than eight in the tens place.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I did that correctly. Let me check again. From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 hundreds would be 40 each. Then, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 fours. The tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 eights. So, yes, that's correct. So, in the tens place, we have 50 fours and 49 eights.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place:\n\nThe hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only has 488 pages, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4, not 8. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Pages 400-488 have hundreds digit 4, so that's 89 pages, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Pages 1-399 have hundreds digits 0,1,2,3, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, yes, 89 fours and 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nStarting with fours:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal fours = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nNow, eights:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal eights = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the total number of fours is 188 and the total number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each.\n- Remaining 8 pages: 481-488, units digits 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484), 8 appears once (488).\n- Total units: 48 + 1 = 49 fours, 48 + 1 = 49 eights.\n\nTens place:\n\n- 400 pages: 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, 40 each.\n- From 401-488: tens digits are 0 (401-409), 1 (410-419), 2 (420-429), 3 (430-439), 4 (440-449), 5 (450-459), 6 (460-469), 7 (470-479), 8 (480-488). So, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n- So, tens place total: 40 + 10 = 50 fours, 40 + 9 = 49 eights.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 400-488: 89 pages, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n- So, 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\nTotal fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Units Place Analysis:**\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total complete sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 sets.\n   - Each digit appears 48 times in the units place.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one '4' (page 484) and one '8' (page 488).\n   - Total in units place: 49 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place Analysis:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred.\n   - First 400 pages: 4 sets of 100, contributing 40 '4's and 40 '8's.\n   - Pages 401-488: '4' appears 10 times (440-449), '8' appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total in tens place: 50 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place Analysis:**\n   - Pages 400-488: Hundreds digit is '4' for 89 pages.\n   - No '8's in the hundreds place.\n   - Total in hundreds place: 89 '4's and 0 '8's.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 '4's - 98 '8's = 90 more '4's.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately\u2014like units, tens, and hundreds places\u2014and then compare them.\n\nLet me start by understanding the range of page numbers. The book has pages from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers can be one-digit (1-9), two-digit (10-99), or three-digit (100-488). I should handle each of these ranges separately.\n\nStarting with one-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digits that appear are just the numbers themselves. So, how many 4's and 8's are there? Well, each digit from 1 to 9 appears exactly once. So, there's one 4 and one 8 in the one-digit range.\n\nMoving on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I think I should consider each place separately.\n\nFirst, the tens place. For two-digit numbers, the tens digit ranges from 1 to 9. So, for each tens digit, there are 10 possible units digits (0-9). Now, I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears in the numbers 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in 80-89, which is also 10 times. So, in the tens place, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times each in the two-digit range.\n\nNext, the units place. For each tens group (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. Since there are 9 groups of ten in two-digit numbers (10-99), that's 9 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place.\n\nWait, but actually, from 10 to 99, there are 9 tens groups (10-19 up to 90-99). So, in the units place, 4 appears 9 times, and 8 also appears 9 times.\n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19. Similarly, the total number of 8's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19. Hmm, so in two-digit numbers, 4 and 8 appear the same number of times.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is where it might get a bit more complicated because the hundreds digit changes, and the range isn't a full hundred. So, I need to handle this carefully.\n\nLet me break this down into hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, let's consider each hundreds group:\n\n- 100-199: Hundreds digit is 1\n- 200-299: Hundreds digit is 2\n- 300-399: Hundreds digit is 3\n- 400-488: Hundreds digit is 4\n\nNow, I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each digit place across these groups.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. In the hundreds place, 4 appears only in the 400-488 range. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. But wait, the problem is about digits, not numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, but 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the hundreds digit only goes up to 4.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. For each hundreds group, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9, and the units digit also cycles from 0 to 9. So, for each hundreds group, each tens digit appears 10 times per units digit, making 100 numbers per hundreds group.\n\nWait, but for the last hundreds group (400-488), the tens digit goes up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, I need to adjust for that.\n\nLet me handle each hundreds group separately.\n\n1. 100-199: Tens place can be 0-9, and units 0-9. So, for each tens digit, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. Since there are 10 possible units digits, each tens digit appears 10 times. So, in 100-199, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times as well.\n\n2. 200-299: Same as above. 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\n3. 300-399: Same. 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place.\n\n4. 400-488: Now, the tens digit can be 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). Wait, no, actually, the tens digit in 400-488 can be 0-8 because 488 is the last page. Let me check: from 400-409, 410-419, ..., up to 480-488. So, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but for tens digit 8, the units digit only goes up to 8.\n\nSo, in the tens place for 400-488:\n\n- For tens digits 0-7: Each appears 10 times (units 0-9)\n- For tens digit 8: Appears 9 times (units 0-8)\n\nSo, for digit 4 in the tens place in 400-488: How many times does 4 appear? Well, the tens digit is 4 in the range 440-449. So, that's 10 times (units 0-9). So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nFor digit 8 in the tens place: The tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 times (units 0-8). So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in 400-488.\n\nSo, across all hundreds groups:\n\n- For 4 in tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 times.\n- For 8 in tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 40 times, and 8 appears 39 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, let's consider each hundreds group.\n\n1. 100-199: For each tens group (like 100-109, 110-119, etc.), the units digit cycles 0-9. So, in each tens group, 4 appears once in the units place, and 8 appears once. There are 10 tens groups (0-9), so 10 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place.\n\n2. 200-299: Same as above. 10 times each for 4 and 8.\n\n3. 300-399: Same. 10 times each.\n\n4. 400-488: Here, the tens digit goes up to 8, so let's see. For each tens group from 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488, the units digit cycles 0-9 except for the last group where it's 0-8.\n\nSo, for each tens group except the last one (480-488), the units digit cycles 0-9, so 4 and 8 each appear once per tens group. There are 9 tens groups (400-409 up to 470-479), each contributing 1 occurrence of 4 and 8 in the units place. So, that's 9 times each.\n\nFor the last tens group, 480-488, the units digit goes from 0-8. So, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). Wait, but 488 is included, so 8 appears at 488, which is within the units digits 0-8. So, in this group, 4 appears once and 8 appears once.\n\nSo, total for units place in 400-488:\n\n- 4: 9 (from 400-479) + 1 (484) = 10 times\n- 8: 9 (from 400-479) + 1 (488) = 10 times\n\nWait, but actually, from 400-479, there are 8 tens groups (400-409 up to 470-479), each contributing 1 occurrence of 4 and 8 in the units place. Then, 480-488 is the 9th tens group, contributing another occurrence each.\n\nWait, that would make it 9 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place in 400-488.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 400-488, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each of the first 8 tens groups (400-409 to 470-479), so each of those contributes 1 occurrence of 4 and 8 in the units place, totaling 8 each. Then, in 480-488, units digits go from 0-8, so 4 appears at 484 and 8 appears at 488. So, that's 1 each, making total 9 each.\n\nWait, so in the units place, 4 and 8 each appear 9 times in 400-488.\n\nSo, across all hundreds groups:\n\n- For 4 in units place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n- For 8 in units place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, in the units place, 4 appears 39 times, and 8 appears 39 times.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place across all page numbers.\n\nStarting with the one-digit pages (1-9):\n\n- 4's: 1\n- 8's: 1\n\nTwo-digit pages (10-99):\n\n- 4's: 19\n- 8's: 19\n\nThree-digit pages (100-488):\n\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 4's: 89\n  - 8's: 0\n- Tens place:\n  - 4's: 40\n  - 8's: 39\n- Units place:\n  - 4's: 39\n  - 8's: 39\n\nSo, adding these up:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Hundreds: 89\n- Tens: 40\n- Units: 39\n- Plus one-digit: 1\n- Plus two-digit: 19\n\nWait, no, wait. I think I made a mistake here. I think I should sum all the places for three-digit numbers and then add the one-digit and two-digit counts separately.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the three-digit numbers, the hundreds, tens, and units places are all contributing. So, the total 4's in three-digit numbers are 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n\nSimilarly, total 8's in three-digit numbers are 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n\nThen, adding the one-digit and two-digit counts:\n\n- 4's: 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188\n- 8's: 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98\n\nWait, so 4's total 188, 8's total 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 appears 0 times.\n- Tens place: 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n- Units place: 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\nSo, 4's in three-digit: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n8's in three-digit: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nThen, two-digit:\n\n- 4's: 19\n- 8's: 19\n\nOne-digit:\n\n- 4's: 1\n- 8's: 1\n\nSo, total 4's: 168 + 19 + 1 = 188\nTotal 8's: 78 + 19 + 1 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure if I counted the three-digit units place correctly. Let me check that again.\n\nIn three-digit numbers, for the units place:\n\n- 100-199: 10 times each for 4 and 8\n- 200-299: 10 each\n- 300-399: 10 each\n- 400-488: 9 each (since units go up to 8 in the last group)\n\nSo, 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 each for 4 and 8 in units place.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place:\n\n- 100-199: 10 each\n- 200-299: 10 each\n- 300-399: 10 each\n- 400-488: 10 for 4 (440-449) and 9 for 8 (480-488)\n\nSo, 4's in tens: 10*3 + 10 = 40\n8's in tens: 10*3 + 9 = 39\n\nAnd hundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because I remember sometimes when counting digits, especially in ranges, it's easy to miscount. Let me see if there's another way to approach this, maybe using a formula or a different counting method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each place up to 488 and then compare.\n\nFor units place:\n\n- From 1 to 488, each digit 0-9 appears equally in the units place, except possibly the last partial group.\n\nThe number of complete groups of 10 in 488 is 48 full groups (1-480), with 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n\nIn each complete group of 10, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. So, for 48 groups, each digit appears 48 times. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so digits 1-8 appear once each, and 9-0 don't appear.\n\nSo, total units digits:\n\n- For digits 0-8: 48 times each, plus 1 more for digits 1-8 (since they appear in 481-488). So, 49 times each for 1-8, and 48 times each for 0 and 9.\n\nWait, but wait, in 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so digits 1-8 each get an extra count. So, units place:\n\n- 0: 48 times\n- 1: 48 + 1 = 49\n- 2: 48 + 1 = 49\n- ...\n- 8: 48 + 1 = 49\n- 9: 48 times\n\nSo, in units place, 4 appears 49 times, and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place:\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 4 complete hundreds (00-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), and a partial hundred (400-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 00-09, 10-19, etc.), so 10 times each per hundred. So, for 4 complete hundreds (00-399), each digit appears 4*10 = 40 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, in the partial hundred (400-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last number). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does each appear?\n\n- Tens digits 0-7: Each appears 10 times (units 0-9)\n- Tens digit 8: Appears 9 times (units 0-8)\n\nSo, for the tens place in 400-488:\n\n- 0: 10\n- 1: 10\n- ...\n- 7: 10\n- 8: 9\n\nTherefore, total tens place counts:\n\n- For digits 0-7: 40 (from 000-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 50 each\n- For digit 8: 40 (from 000-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 49\n- For digit 9: 40 times (but only up to 399, so 40 times)\n\nWait, but wait, from 000-399, each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place. Then, in 400-488, as above.\n\nSo, for tens place:\n\n- 0: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 1: 40 + 10 = 50\n- ...\n- 7: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 8: 40 + 9 = 49\n- 9: 40 times\n\nWait, but 9 doesn't appear in the tens place in 400-488 because the highest is 488, so tens digit 8 is the maximum. So, 9 appears 40 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, in the hundreds place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, the hundreds digit is:\n\n- 0 for 1-99\n- 1 for 100-199\n- 2 for 200-299\n- 3 for 300-399\n- 4 for 400-488\n\nSo, for hundreds place:\n\n- 0: 99 times (pages 1-99)\n- 1: 100 times (100-199)\n- 2: 100 times (200-299)\n- 3: 100 times (300-399)\n- 4: 89 times (400-488)\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for 4 and 8 across all places.\n\nFor 4:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\n- Plus, in one-digit and two-digit numbers, we have:\n\nWait, no, wait. I think I'm mixing up the approaches. In the previous approach, I considered one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit separately, but in this approach, I'm considering units, tens, and hundreds across all numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should stick with the first method where I separated one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers because in the first approach, I might have double-counted or missed something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to calculate each digit place separately across all numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nUnits place:\n\nAs calculated earlier, 4 appears 49 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nTens place:\n\n4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nSo, difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, that matches my earlier calculation. So, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me confirm again. From 1 to 488:\n\n- Units place: 49 each for 4 and 8\n- Tens place: 50 for 4, 49 for 8\n- Hundreds place: 89 for 4, 0 for 8\n\nSo, 4's total: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n8's total: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the first approach, when I separated one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit, I got the same result. So, I think 90 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me recount the three-digit numbers' units place.\n\nIn three-digit numbers (100-488):\n\n- 100-199: 10 units each for 4 and 8\n- 200-299: 10 each\n- 300-399: 10 each\n- 400-488: 9 each (since 488 ends at 8)\n\nSo, 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 each for 4 and 8 in units place.\n\nSimilarly, tens place:\n\n- 100-199: 10 each\n- 200-299: 10 each\n- 300-399: 10 each\n- 400-488: 10 for 4 (440-449) and 9 for 8 (480-488)\n\nSo, 10*3 + 10 = 40 for 4 in tens place, and 10*3 +9 = 39 for 8.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 400-488: 89 times for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nSo, in three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\n- 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nThen, two-digit numbers (10-99):\n\n- Units place: 9 each\n- Tens place: 10 each\n- So, 4's: 10 + 9 = 19\n- 8's: 10 + 9 = 19\n\nOne-digit numbers (1-9):\n\n- 4: 1\n- 8: 1\n\nSo, total 4's: 168 + 19 + 1 = 188\nTotal 8's: 78 + 19 + 1 = 98\nDifference: 90\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - From 1 to 488, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place for complete groups of 10.\n   - In the last partial group (481-488), digits 1-8 each appear once, adding one more count.\n   - Total: 49 each for 4 and 8.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place for complete groups of 100 (1-399).\n   - In 400-488, digits 0-7 appear 10 times each, and 8 appears 9 times.\n   - Total: 50 for 4, 49 for 8.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Digits 1-3 each appear 100 times (100-199, 200-299, 300-399).\n   - Digit 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 does not appear.\n   - Total: 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nSumming these:\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Page numbers go from 1 to 488, so each page has a single digit, two digits, or maybe even three digits, but since 488 is a three-digit number, I need to account for all three places: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nI think the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4. I'll go through each position one by one.\n\nFirst, the units place. In the units place, the digits cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in every set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in each complete set, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (page 484). So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers, with each digit from 0 to 9 appearing 10 times in a row. So, for the tens place, the digit 4 will appear 10 times every 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, it's pages 40-49; in 101-200, it's pages 140-149, and so on. Now, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? That's 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 pages left (401-488). So, in each complete hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages, so 4 times 10 is 40. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. Let's see, in 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, it's 1; and so on. Wait, actually, from 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles as follows: 401-410 (tens digit 0), 411-420 (1), 421-430 (2), 431-440 (3), 441-450 (4), 451-460 (5), 461-470 (6), 471-480 (7), and 481-488 (8). So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 pages (441 to 450). But wait, 488 is only up to 488, so 450 is within that range. So, that's another 10 pages. So, total in the tens place: 40 (from the complete hundreds) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400 to 488. So, how many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 pages because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, in the units place, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, how many complete sets of 10 are in 488? 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (page 488). So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in sets of 10 numbers every 100. So, in each 100 numbers, the tens digit is 8 for 10 pages, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds. So, 4 times 10 is 40. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes up to 8. Let's see, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488. So, how many pages is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the remaining 88 pages. So, total in the tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units: 49, tens: 49, hundreds: 0. So, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I was counting 4's, I got 188, and 8's as 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nBut wait, I think I might have made a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. Let me double-check that.\n\nIn the tens place for 8's, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 pages. So, 9 times. So, yes, 40 + 9 = 49. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When counting the tens place for 8's, in each 100, it's 10 times, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 pages, from 401 to 488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, total 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but when I was counting the 4's in the tens place, I had 50. Hmm, maybe I should check that as well.\n\nFor the 4's in the tens place, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 pages, right? So, that's correct. So, 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 = 50.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the difference was 90, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistake in the hundreds place for 4's.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me check the 4's in the units place again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 pages, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus the last partial set from 481-488, which includes 484, so one more 4. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's in the units place, same logic: 48 complete sets, 48 8's, plus 488, which is an 8 in the units place, so 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the 8's in the tens place again. So, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, that's 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. So, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in the hundreds place, it's easy to make an off-by-one error. Let me confirm the hundreds place for 4's again.\n\nFrom page 400 to 488, inclusive, how many pages is that? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89 pages. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so 0 there.\n\nSo, 4's total: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's total: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because sometimes when counting, especially in the tens place for 8's, maybe I missed something. Let me try a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position separately, using a formula.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of 4's in units place = floor(488 / 10) + (1 if 488 % 10 >= 4 else 0). Wait, no, that's not exactly right.\n\nActually, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is given by:\n\nnumber = (n // 10) * 1 + min(max(n % 10 - d + 1, 0), 10)\n\nWait, maybe that's complicating it. Alternatively, for each digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place up to n is:\n\ncount = (n // 10) + (1 if n % 10 >= d else 0)\n\nWait, let me test this with n=488 and d=4.\n\nn//10 = 48, and since 488%10=8 >=4, so count=48+1=49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8, n//10=48, and 8 >=8, so count=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nFor the tens place, the formula is a bit different. The number of times digit d appears in the tens place up to n is:\n\ncount = (n // 100) * 10 + extra\n\nWhere extra is the number of times d appears in the tens place in the remaining part.\n\nIf the tens digit of n is greater than d, then extra is 10; if it's equal to d, then extra is (n % 100) + 1; else, extra is 0.\n\nWait, maybe that's a bit more involved. Let me try for d=4 and n=488.\n\nn=488, so hundreds digit is 4, tens digit is 8, units digit is 8.\n\nFor the tens place, the number of 4's:\n\nThe hundreds part is 4, so for each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9. So, for each hundred, 10 times the digit appears in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40.\n\nNow, the remaining part is 88. The tens digit in the remaining part is 8, which is greater than 4, so the extra is 10, because in the tens place, 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, total 40 + 10=50. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8 in the tens place:\n\nNumber of times 8 appears in the tens place up to 488.\n\nHundreds part is 4, so 4*10=40.\n\nThe remaining part is 88. The tens digit is 8, so since the tens digit is equal to 8, the extra is (n % 100) + 1. Wait, n is 488, so n % 100 is 88. So, the extra would be 88 + 1 = 89? Wait, that can't be right because in the tens place, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 pages (480-488). Hmm, so maybe my formula is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nIf the tens digit of n is greater than d, then extra = 10.\n\nIf the tens digit is equal to d, then extra = units digit + 1.\n\nIf less, then extra = 0.\n\nSo, for d=8, in the remaining 88, the tens digit is 8, which is equal to d. So, extra = units digit +1. But wait, the units digit in 488 is 8, so units digit +1 is 8 +1=9. So, extra=9.\n\nThus, total 40 + 9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, that formula works.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds place, the number of times d appears is:\n\nIf d is less than the hundreds digit, then (hundreds digit) * 100.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to think as follows:\n\nFor hundreds place, the digit d appears in the hundreds place for 100 consecutive numbers. So, for each hundred where the hundreds digit is d, it appears 100 times.\n\nBut in our case, for d=4, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 pages, not 100, because we don't go up to 500.\n\nSo, the count is 89.\n\nFor d=8, the hundreds digit never reaches 8 in 488, so 0.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think my earlier counts are correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. When counting the hundreds place for 4's, I considered 400-488 as 89 pages, but does that include all the 4's in the hundreds place? Yes, because every page from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times.\n\nSimilarly, for the units and tens places, I think I accounted for all possible occurrences.\n\nSo, I think the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check once more. Maybe I can list the counts again:\n\n4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves counting how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 instances. The remaining 8 pages (481-488) include one more 4 (page 484). Total: 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 4 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. In 488, there are 4 complete hundreds, contributing 40 instances. The remaining 88 pages include 10 more instances (440-449). Total: 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit 4 appears in all pages from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages. Total: 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to 4's, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 complete sets, contributing 48 instances. The remaining 8 pages include one more 8 (page 488). Total: 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 8 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. In 488, there are 4 complete hundreds, contributing 40 instances. The remaining 88 pages include 9 more instances (480-488). Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488. Total: 0.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 90 times more than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should look at each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds. That way, I can count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every block of 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So in each block, 4 and 8 each appear exactly once. Since the book has 488 pages, that's 48 full blocks of 10 pages (because 48*10=480) and then 8 extra pages. So in the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 (from the full blocks) plus 1 if the 4 is within the last 8 pages. Wait, 480 to 488: the units digits go from 0 to 8. So 4 appears once in the units place in the last 8 pages (page 484). So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for units place 8's: in each block of 10, 8 appears once. So 48 blocks give 48 eights, and in the last 8 pages, 8 appears once (page 488). So units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. So the difference here is zero.\n\nNow moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So for 488 pages, we have 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 80-88 pages in the next hundred.\n\nWait, no. Wait, 488 is 4 hundreds (0-399) plus 88 pages (400-487) and then page 488. Hmm, maybe I should think differently. Each hundred block has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So for 400 pages (4 hundreds), each digit appears 4*10=40 times in the tens place. Now, for the remaining 88 pages (400-487), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So for the tens digit, 4 appears 10 times (400-409), and 8 appears 10 times (480-489). But wait, we only go up to 487, so 480-487 is 8 pages, so the tens digit 8 appears 8 times here, right? Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but we only go up to 487, so 480-487 is 8 pages, so the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place for these pages. Similarly, 4 appears 10 times in 400-409, but we have all 10 pages in 400-409 because 400 is included and 409 is within 488.\n\nWait, 400-409 is 10 pages, so the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. Then from 410-419, tens digit is 1, and so on. So in the tens place, for 400-487, how many times does 4 and 8 appear?\n\nWait, perhaps I should separate the counting. For the tens digit:\n\n- For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So in 400 pages (0-399), each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place.\n\n- Now, from 400-487, which is 88 pages, the tens digit goes from 0 (400-409) to 8 (480-487). So for each tens digit, how many times does it appear?\n\n- For 400-409: tens digit is 0, so 0 appears 10 times.\n- 410-419: tens digit 1, 10 times.\n- ...\n- 470-479: tens digit 7, 10 times.\n- 480-487: tens digit 8, 8 times.\n\nSo in 400-487, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449?), wait no, 400-409 is 0, 410-419 is 1, so 440-449 would be tens digit 4. Wait, no, 400-409 is 0, 410-419 is 1, 420-429 is 2, 430-439 is 3, 440-449 is 4, 450-459 is 5, 460-469 is 6, 470-479 is 7, 480-487 is 8.\n\nWait, so in 400-487, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 appears in 480-487, which is 8 pages, so 8 times.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place:\n\n- For 400-487, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo total in the tens place:\n\n- 4's: 40 (from 0-399) + 10 (from 400-487) = 50\n- 8's: 40 (from 0-399) + 8 (from 400-487) = 48\n\nWait, but wait, does 0-399 include 400-399? No, 0-399 is 400 pages, and 400-487 is another 88 pages, making total 488 pages. So in 0-399, each tens digit appears 40 times. Then in 400-487, as above, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50\n\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 + 8 = 48\n\nSo the difference in tens place is 50 - 48 = 2 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I'm including page 488 correctly. Page 488 is beyond 487, so it's part of the next hundred, but since we only have 488 pages, 488 is the last page. So in the tens place, 488 has 8 as the tens digit, so that's one more 8 in the tens place. Wait, but in my earlier count, from 400-487, I only considered up to 487, so page 488 would be an extra page beyond that. So in 400-488, the tens digit for 488 is 8, so that's an additional 8 in the tens place. So that would make 8's in tens place: 40 (from 0-399) + 8 (from 400-487) + 1 (from 488) = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 400-487 is 88 pages, so 488 is page 488, which is beyond 487, so it's an extra page. So in the tens place, 488 has 8 as the tens digit, so that's an extra 8. So total 8's in tens place: 40 + 8 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSo the difference in tens place is 50 - 49 = 1 more 4 than 8.\n\nWait, that's different from my initial thought. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in 400-487, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-487, which is 8 pages, so 8 times. Then page 488 is an additional page, so tens digit 8 appears once more, making it 9 times in 400-488. But wait, 480-487 is 8 pages, and 488 is one more, so total 9 times. Therefore, 8's in tens place from 400-488: 9 times. So total 8's in tens place: 40 (from 0-399) + 9 = 49.\n\nAnd 4's in tens place: 40 (from 0-399) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50.\n\nSo difference in tens place: 50 - 49 = 1.\n\nOkay, so that's the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo in the hundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears in pages 400-488. How many times? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\n- 8 appears in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit only goes up to 4, because 488 is less than 500. So 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo the difference in hundreds place is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the differences from each place:\n\n- Units place: 49 - 49 = 0\n- Tens place: 50 - 49 = 1\n- Hundreds place: 89 - 0 = 89\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check each step again.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 times, correct. 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place, correct.\n\nIn the tens place, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount.\n\nIn the tens place:\n\n- From 0-399: each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place.\n- From 400-488: the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So for each tens digit, how many times does it appear?\n\n- 400-409: tens digit 0, 10 times\n- 410-419: 1, 10 times\n- 420-429: 2, 10 times\n- 430-439: 3, 10 times\n- 440-449: 4, 10 times\n- 450-459: 5, 10 times\n- 460-469: 6, 10 times\n- 470-479: 7, 10 times\n- 480-488: 8, 9 times (since 480-488 is 9 pages, not 8)\n\nWait, 480-488 is 9 pages, so tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nTherefore, total in tens place:\n\n- 4's: 40 (from 0-399) + 10 = 50\n- 8's: 40 (from 0-399) + 9 = 49\n\nSo difference in tens place: 50 - 49 = 1.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place for 480 pages (48*10=480), and then 8 more pages (481-488), which adds 1 more 4 (484) and 1 more 8 (488).\n\nSo units place:\n\n- 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n- 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n- Difference: 0\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n- Difference: 89\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nSo 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 pages, 4 appears once. So 488 divided by 10 is 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So 4 appears once more (484). So total 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears in the units place 48 times from the full cycles, and once more in 488, so 48 +1=49.\n\nSo units place difference is zero.\n\nTens place: as above, 50 for 4's, 49 for 8's, difference 1.\n\nHundreds place: 89 for 4's, 0 for 8's, difference 89.\n\nTotal difference: 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there any other place where 8 could appear in the hundreds digit? No, because the book is 488 pages, so the hundreds digit only goes up to 4.\n\nWait, but wait, 488 is page 488, so the hundreds digit is 4, tens digit is 8, units digit is 8. So in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, 8 doesn't appear. In the tens place, 8 appears 9 times (from 480-488), and in the units place, 8 appears 49 times. So 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 50 (tens) + 49 (units) = 188? Wait, no, I'm adding them, but I think I should be counting each digit separately.\n\nWait, no, I think I was correct before. The total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, 188 - 98 = 90. So yes, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the counts again.\n\nUnits place: 49 4's, 49 8's.\n\nTens place: 50 4's, 49 8's.\n\nHundreds place: 89 4's, 0 8's.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think I've considered all the places and made sure not to double-count or miss any. So the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - For 488 pages, there are 48 full cycles of 10 pages, contributing 48 '4's and 48 '8's.\n   - In the remaining 8 pages (481-488), '4' appears once (484) and '8' appears once (488).\n   - Total '4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total '8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Difference in units place: 49 - 49 = 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - For 400 pages (0-399), each digit appears 40 times.\n   - From 400-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8.\n     - '4' appears 10 times (440-449).\n     - '8' appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total '4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total '8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n   - Difference in tens place: 50 - 49 = 1.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - The hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n   - '4' appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Difference in hundreds place: 89 - 0 = 89.\n\n4. **Total Difference**:\n   - Units place: 0\n   - Tens place: 1\n   - Hundreds place: 89\n   - Total: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should look at the digits separately, like the units place and the tens place, and count how many times each digit appears in each position. \n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every 10 pages, the digits 0 through 9 each appear once in the units place. So, from page 1 to page 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears once. But wait, that's only for the first 10 pages. Since the book has 488 pages, maybe I can calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are and then see how many 4's and 8's are in those.\n\nSo, 488 divided by 10 is 48 complete groups, with 8 pages remaining. Each complete group contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 groups would mean 48 times 1, which is 48 4's and 48 8's in the units place. Then, the remaining 8 pages (from 481 to 488) would have units digits 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears once more, and 8 appears once more. So, total 4's in units place would be 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's would be 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, they are equal.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit changes every 10 pages. So, for example, from 1-10, the tens digit is 0, then from 11-20, it's 1, and so on. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for every 100 pages. So, in 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4 complete hundreds, with 88 pages remaining. \n\nWait, but the tens digit goes from 0 to 9, so in each hundred, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4 times 10, which is 40 times each digit in the tens place. So, the digit 4 would appear 40 times in the tens place, and the digit 8 would also appear 40 times in the tens place. \n\nNow, what about the remaining 88 pages? The remaining pages after 400 would be from 401 to 488. So, the tens digit in this range would go from 0 to 8, right? Let me see: 401-410: tens digit 0, 411-420: tens digit 1, ..., 481-490: tens digit 8. Wait, but 488 is less than 490, so actually, from 481 to 488, the tens digit is 8. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place in these 88 pages? Let me see: from 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles through 0 to 8, each for 10 pages, except the last one which is only 8 pages. So, each digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times in the tens place, except for the last digit, which is 8, which appears 8 times. Wait, no, that might not be correct.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to consider that from 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8, each for 10 pages. So, 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 pages), 411-420: tens digit 1 (10 pages), and so on, up to 481-490: tens digit 8 (10 pages). But since the book ends at 488, the last set is only 8 pages (481-488). So, the tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times. So, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears 8 times more in the remaining 88 pages. But wait, actually, from 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, each for 10 pages except the last one, which is 8 pages. So, for each digit from 0 to 8, except 8, they appear 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 times. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 481-488 is 8 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for all 8 pages. So, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears 8 times in the remaining 88 pages. \n\nSo, total times 8 appears in the tens place would be 40 (from the first 400 pages) plus 8 (from 481-488), totaling 48 times. \n\nWhat about the digit 4 in the tens place? From 401 to 488, when does the tens digit equal 4? That would be pages 441-450. Wait, no, 441-450 would have tens digit 4, right? So, that's 10 pages, so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in the remaining 88 pages. So, total for 4 in the tens place would be 40 (from first 400 pages) plus 10 (from 441-450), totaling 50 times.\n\nWait, but wait, 401-488 is 88 pages, so 441-450 is within that range, so yes, 10 pages. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in the remaining pages, making total 40 + 10 = 50. \n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 48 times. So, the difference in the tens place is 50 - 48 = 2 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let me check if I considered the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, right? So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Let's see, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, meaning 89 times. \n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but hold on, I'm not sure if I should include the hundreds place. Let me think. The problem is about page numbers, and each page is numbered from 1 to 488. So, pages 1-99 have no hundreds digit, pages 100-399 have hundreds digits 1-3, pages 400-488 have hundreds digit 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, which is less than 800. So, 8 in the hundreds place is 0 times, and 4 appears 89 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the digits. Let's sum up the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each place.\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 48 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97 times\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 188 - 97 = 91, which seems like a lot. Maybe I made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me check again.\n\nUnits place:\n- From 1 to 488, how many 4's and 8's in units place?\nAs I thought earlier, every 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once. So, 488 / 10 = 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So, total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49, 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n- From 1 to 400, each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place (since 400 / 100 = 4, and each hundred has 10 times each digit in the tens place).\nSo, 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 40 times.\n\nFrom 401 to 488:\n- The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8, each for 10 pages, except the last one which is 8 pages (481-488). So, for each digit 0-8, they appear 10 times in the tens place. But wait, 401-488 is 88 pages, which is 8 full tens (0-7) and then 8 pages with tens digit 8.\n\nWait, so for each digit from 0 to 7, they appear 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 8 times. So, in the tens place from 401-488:\n- 4 appears 10 times (from 441-450)\n- 8 appears 8 times (from 481-488)\n\nSo, total in tens place:\n- 4: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50\n- 8: 40 (from 1-400) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48\n\nHundreds place:\n- From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so 4 appears 89 times (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89)\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place, so 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor units place:\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) + (1 if 488 mod 10 >=4 else 0) = 48 + 1 = 49\nSimilarly, number of 8's: floor(488/10) + (1 if 488 mod 10 >=8 else 0) = 48 + 1 = 49\n\nFor tens place:\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100)*10 + (if (488 mod 100) >=40 then (488 mod 100 - 40 +1) else 0)\nWait, perhaps a better formula is to calculate how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nIn the tens place, the number of times digit d appears is:\n- For each hundred, digit d appears 10 times in the tens place.\n- For the remaining pages beyond complete hundreds, if the tens digit is >= d, then add the excess over 10*d.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, for the tens place, the number of times 4 appears is:\nNumber of complete hundreds: 4 (since 488 / 100 = 4.88)\nEach complete hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place, so 4*10=40 for 4 and 8.\n\nThen, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8, each for 10 pages except the last which is 8 pages.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears once in the tens place for 10 pages (441-450), so 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears in the tens place for 8 pages (481-488).\n\nSo, total for 4 in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50\nTotal for 8 in tens place: 40 + 8 = 48\n\nHundreds place:\n4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\n8 never appears in hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nHmm, so the answer would be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check because 91 seems high. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me recount the hundreds place.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, inclusive, how many pages? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit goes through 0 to 8. For each digit, 0-7, each appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, 4's in tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50\n8's in tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48\n\nUnits place: both 4 and 8 appear 49 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nI think that's correct. So, there are 91 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to 8's. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total complete groups of 10 in 488 pages: 48 groups.\n   - 48 groups \u00d7 1 occurrence each = 48 4's and 48 8's.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488) contribute 1 more 4 and 1 more 8.\n   - **Total in units place:** 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - From 1-400: 4 complete hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - From 401-488:\n     - Tens digits cycle 0-8, each for 10 pages except the last (8 pages).\n     - 4 appears 10 times (441-450).\n     - 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n   - **Total in tens place:** 50 4's and 48 8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488: Hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - **8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91\n\n**Answer:** There are 91 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Maybe I should look at each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds. That might make it easier to count how many times each digit appears.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every 10 pages, the digits 0 through 9 each appear once in the units place. So, from page 1 to page 10, the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. Then it repeats. So, in each set of 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 appears once. So, for the units place, the number of 4's and 8's would be the same, right? \n\nWait, but the book has 488 pages, which is 48 full sets of 10 pages (since 48*10=480) and then 8 more pages. So, in the units place, from 1 to 480, each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times. So, 4 appears 48 times and 8 appears 48 times in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in this last partial set, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So, total in units place: 48+1=49 times for 4, and 48+1=49 times for 8. So, they're equal in the units place.\n\nHmm, so maybe the difference comes from the tens place. Let me check the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digits go from 0 (for 1-9), then 1 (11-19), 2 (21-29), ..., up to 9 (91-99). So, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place per 100 pages. So, in 488 pages, how many full hundreds do we have? Well, 488 is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). \n\nWait, no, actually, 488 is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). So, in each full hundred, the digit in the tens place cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the digit 8 appears 10 times. So, for 4 hundreds, that would be 4*10=40 times each. Then, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-490), but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 is only present from 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place in 401-488? Let's see: 441-450, where the tens digit is 4. That's 10 pages, so 10 times. Wait, no, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 occurs in 481-490, but we only go up to 488, so that's 8 pages. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times in the last partial hundred. So, total in tens place: 4 hundreds contribute 40 each, plus the last partial 88 pages contribute 10 for 4 and 8 for 8. So, total for 4 in tens place: 40+10=50, and for 8: 40+8=48. So, 50-48=2 more 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me check again. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490). So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 occurs in 481-490, but since we stop at 488, it's only 8 pages. So, in the tens place, 4 occurs 10 times, 8 occurs 8 times in this last partial hundred. So, yes, adding to the 40 each from the four full hundreds, 4 has 50, 8 has 48. So, 4 has 2 more in the tens place.\n\nNow, what about the hundreds place? From 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's there. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's. From 200-299, hundreds digit is 2. From 300-399, it's 3. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up all the places:\n\nUnits place: 49 times for 4, 49 times for 8.\n\nTens place: 50 times for 4, 48 times for 8.\n\nHundreds place: 89 times for 4, 0 times for 8.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91. So, there are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFrom 1-480: 48 sets of 10, so 48 4's and 48 8's.\n\nFrom 481-488: units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units: 48+1=49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nTens place:\n\nFrom 1-400: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 40 each.\n\nFrom 401-488: tens digits go from 0-8. 4 occurs in 441-450 (10 times), 8 occurs in 481-488 (8 times). So, tens place: 40+10=50 for 4, 40+8=48 for 8.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 400-488: 89 pages, so 89 4's in hundreds place. 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should look at each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds, and so on. \n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every set of ten pages, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for the digit 8. So in each ten-page block, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. But wait, when we get to the last set, which might not be a full ten pages, I need to check if 488 is included. \n\nWait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit goes up to 8. So in the units place, for each ten, 4 and 8 each appear once. So how many tens are there? From 1 to 488, there are 48 full tens (since 48*10=480) and then 8 more pages (481-488). So in the units place, 4 appears 48 times (once in each ten) plus maybe once more in 484? Wait, no, 484 is in the 480-489 range, which is the 48th ten. So in the units place, 4 appears 48 times, and 8 appears 48 times as well. But wait, in the 480-489 range, 488 is the last page, so 8 appears once in the units place at 488. So maybe units place for 4 is 48 times and for 8 it's also 48 times. So the count in units place is the same for both digits.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each hundred. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So for each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, same with 8. Now, how many hundreds do we have? From 1-488, we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages in the 401-488 range. So in each of the first four hundreds, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times as well. So that's 4*10=40 times for 4 and 40 times for 8 in the tens place so far. \n\nBut wait, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So in 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-490, but we only go up to 488). So in this range, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It would be from 440-449, which is 10 pages, but since we're only going up to 488, 440-449 is entirely within 401-488, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place here. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place from 480-489, but we only go up to 488, so that's 9 pages (480-488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 pages because 488-480+1=9. So in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488). \n\nWait, so for the tens place in 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So overall, for the tens place across all pages, 4 appears 4*10 +10=50 times, and 8 appears 4*10 +9=49 times. So in the tens place, 4 appears one more time than 8.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. What about 8? Does 8 ever appear in the hundreds place? In a 488-page book, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place:\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 48 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal for 4: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 times\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 48 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal for 8: 48 + 49 + 0 = 97 times\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the units place. Let me double-check. Each ten has one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so from 1-480, that's 48 tens, so 48 times each. Then from 481-488, which is 8 pages, the units digits go from 1-8, so 4 doesn't appear here, but 8 appears once at 488. So actually, in the units place, 4 appears 48 times, and 8 appears 48 (from 1-480) +1 (from 488) = 49 times. Oh, so I think I made a mistake earlier by assuming 8 only appears 48 times in the units place. It should be 49 times because 488 adds another 8 in the units place.\n\nSo correcting that:\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 48 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal: 48 + 50 +89 = 187\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49 times (48 from 1-480, plus 1 at 488)\n- Tens place: 49 times (as calculated earlier)\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 +49 +0 =98\n\nWait, so 4 appears 187 times, and 8 appears 98 times. So the difference is 187 -98 =89. Hmm, that seems a lot. But wait, let me check each place again.\n\nWait, in the units place, from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear? Each 10 pages, 4 appears once. So 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial ten (481-488), does 4 appear? 484 is in this range, so that's another 4 in the units place. So actually, units place for 4 is 48 +1=49 times. Similarly, for 8 in the units place, each ten contributes one 8, so 48 times, plus 488 adds another 8, so 49 times. So both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place.\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that.\n\nUnits place:\n- 4 appears 49 times (48 from full tens, plus 484)\n- 8 appears 49 times (48 from full tens, plus 488)\n\nTens place:\n- For 4: 4 hundreds (each contributing 10 times, so 40) plus in the 400-488 range, 440-449 is 10 pages, so total 50 times\n- For 8: 4 hundreds (40 times) plus in the 400-488 range, 480-488 is 9 pages, so 49 times\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488)\n- 8 appears 0 times\n\nSo now, total for 4:\n49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188\n\nTotal for 8:\n49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 =98\n\nDifference: 188 -98 =90\n\nWait, so the difference is 90. Hmm, but let me check again. Maybe I overcounted somewhere.\n\nWait, in the units place, from 1-488, how many 4's? Let's see, 4,14,24,...,484. So that's every 10 pages, starting at 4, so 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full tens, plus 484 which is the 49th occurrence. So yes, 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: 8,18,28,...,488. That's 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full tens, plus 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So 49 times.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4: Each hundred has 10 occurrences in the tens place. So 4 hundreds (1-400) give 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so total 50 times.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place: Each hundred has 10 occurrences, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488 inclusive). So 40 +9=49 times.\n\nHundreds place: 4 occurs from 400-488, which is 89 pages (488-400+1=89). So 89 times. 8 never occurs in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total for 4: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188\n\nTotal for 8: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 89, but now it's 90. So I think the correct difference is 90.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure about the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAnd in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, so 4's total is 49+50+89=188\n\n8's total is 49+49=98\n\nSo difference is 188-98=90\n\nHmm, so I think the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAnother approach: Let's count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place.\n\nUnits place:\n- 4's: floor(488/10)=48, plus if the last digit is >=4, which it is (8>=4), so 48+1=49\n- 8's: floor(488/10)=48, plus if the last digit is >=8, which it is (8>=8), so 48+1=49\n\nTens place:\n- 4's: floor(488/100)=4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so total 40+10=50\n- 8's: Similarly, 4*10=40. In the last partial hundred, tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 40+9=49\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's: floor(488/1000)=0 full thousands, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's\n- 8's: 0, since 800-899 would be beyond 488\n\nSo 4's: 49+50+89=188\n\n8's:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **4's:** Each ten contributes one 4, totaling 48 from 1-480. Additionally, 484 adds another 4, making it 49.\n   - **8's:** Similarly, each ten contributes one 8, totaling 48 from 1-480. 488 adds another 8, making it 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - **4's:** Each hundred contributes ten 4's, totaling 40 from 1-400. From 400-488, 440-449 adds ten more, totaling 50.\n   - **8's:** Each hundred contributes ten 8's, totaling 40 from 1-400. From 400-488, 480-488 adds nine more, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **4's:** From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n   - **8's:** Never appears in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should look at each digit place separately\u2014like units, tens, hundreds\u2014and count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every ten pages, the digits 0 through 9 each appear once in the units place. So from page 1 to 488, how many complete sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra pages (481 to 488). In each complete set of ten, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So that would be 48 times each. But wait, the extra pages go up to 488, so in the units place, the 4 appears once more on page 484, and the 8 appears once on page 488. So for the units place, 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's would be 48 + 1 = 49 as well. So in the units place, they are equal, right?\n\nNow moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears ten times every hundred pages. So from page 1 to 400, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place? Well, for each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So from 1 to 400, that's 4 hundreds, so 4 times 10, which is 40 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place. But wait, after page 400, we go up to 488, so the tens place goes from 0 to 8 in the hundreds place. So from 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles through 0 to 8 again. So in the tens place, from 401 to 488, each digit from 0 to 8 appears 9 times (since 488 is the last page, so 488 - 400 = 88, which is 8 full tens and 8 units). Wait, no, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me think again.\n\nActually, from 1 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100 pages. So in each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So from 1 to 400, that's four hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place. Then from 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, and each digit appears 9 times (since 488 is the 88th page of the 400s, so the tens digit goes up to 8). So for the tens digit in 401-488, how many times does 4 and 8 appear?\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to calculate how many times each digit appears in the tens place from 1 to 488. So for the tens place, the number of times a digit d appears is equal to the number of complete hundreds times 10 plus the number of times d appears in the incomplete hundreds.\n\nSo, for digit 4 in the tens place:\n\n- From 1-400: 40 times (since each hundred contributes 10 times, 4 hundreds * 10 = 40)\n- From 401-488: The tens digit is 0-8. So how many times does 4 appear? Well, in the 400s, the tens digit cycles 0-9 every 100 pages, but we're only going up to 488, so the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So in the tens place, 4 appears once in 440-449, which is 10 times, but wait, 488 is less than 490, so from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears only once, from 440-449. Wait, no, that's 10 pages, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 times. So total for 4 in tens place is 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place:\n\n- From 1-400: 40 times\n- From 401-488: The tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 times (480-488). So total for 8 in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me check. From 1-400, each digit in the tens place appears 40 times. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does each appear?\n\nThe number of times each digit d (0-8) appears in the tens place from 401-488 is 9 times for d=0 (401-410), 9 times for d=1 (411-420), etc., up to d=8 (481-488). Wait, no, actually, each digit from 0 to 8 appears 9 times in the tens place because 88 pages after 400 would be 488, so the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8, each appearing 9 times. So for 4 in the tens place, it's 9 times, and for 8, it's 9 times as well. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier thought.\n\nWait, no, let's think again. From 401 to 488, how many pages are there? 488 - 400 = 88 pages. So the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490, but we stop at 488). So each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears exactly 9 times because 88 divided by 10 is 8.8, so each digit from 0 to 8 appears 9 times, and 9 is 8 full tens plus 8 extra. Wait, no, 88 pages is 8 full tens (80 pages) and 8 extra, so each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 9 times because the first 80 pages (401-480) have 8 full tens, and then 481-488 adds 8 more, making it 9 times for each digit from 0 to 8.\n\nWait, but 401-410 is 10 pages, 411-420 is another 10, etc., up to 481-490, but we stop at 488. So from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, each appearing 9 times because 488 is 88 pages after 400, which is 8 full tens (80 pages) plus 8 pages, so each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 9 times. Therefore, in the tens place, 4 appears 9 times, and 8 appears 9 times in the 401-488 range.\n\nSo total for tens place:\n\n- 4: 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 401-488) = 49\n- 8: 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 401-488) = 49\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 8 in the tens place from 401-488 was 9 times, but that would make total 49. But wait, in the 400s, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but we only go up to 488, so that's 9 pages (480-488). So yes, 9 times. So both 4 and 8 in the tens place appear 49 times each. So in the tens place, they are equal again.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. From 1-399, the hundreds digit is 0 or 1-3, but since page numbers start at 1, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, from 1-488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8 because 488 is less than 800. So 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the places:\n\n- Units place: 49 times for 4, 49 times for 8\n- Tens place: 49 times for 4, 49 times for 8\n- Hundreds place: 89 times for 4, 0 times for 8\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 49 + 89 = let's see, 49+49 is 98, plus 89 is 187.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nLet me double-check the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those pages, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, from 1-400, each digit appears 40 times in the tens place, and from 401-488, each digit from 0-8 appears 9 times, so 4 and 8 each get 9 more, making 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nIn the units place, same logic: 48 complete sets of ten, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each, plus in the last partial set (481-488), 484 has a 4 and 488 has an 8, so 49 each.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the tens place, from 401-488, I thought each digit appears 9 times, but let me confirm with an example. Let's take the tens digit 4 in 401-488. That would be pages 440-449, which is 10 pages, but since we're only going up to 488, does that affect it? Wait, no, 440-449 is entirely within 401-488, so that's 10 pages, so 10 times. But earlier I thought it was 9 times. Wait, maybe I made a mistake there.\n\nWait, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, and each digit appears 9 times because 488 is 88 pages after 400, which is 8 full tens (80 pages) plus 8 pages. So each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 9 times. But wait, 401-488 is 88 pages, which is 8 full tens (80 pages) and 8 pages. So for each tens digit from 0 to 8, it appears 9 times because the first 80 pages have 8 full tens, and the last 8 pages add one more to each of the first 8 digits. Wait, no, actually, each digit from 0 to 8 appears 9 times because 88 pages is 8 full tens (80 pages) plus 8 pages, so each digit from 0 to 8 appears 9 times. So in the tens place, 4 appears 9 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is 10 pages, which is within 401-488, so that's 10 times, not 9. So maybe my earlier calculation was wrong. Let me recalculate.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but each digit appears 9 times because 88 pages is 8 full tens (80 pages) plus 8 pages, so each digit from 0 to 8 appears 9 times. But 440-449 is 10 pages, which is within 401-488, so that's 10 times. So maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in the tens place from 1 to 488.\n\nThe formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to n is:\n\nLet\u2019s denote n as 488.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\n- The number of complete groups of 100 is floor(n / 100) = 4 (since 4*100=400).\n- For each complete group, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n- Then, for the incomplete group (from 401 to 488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, and each digit appears floor((n % 100)/10) + 1 times if the digit is less than or equal to (n % 100)/10.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: For the tens digit, the count for each digit d is:\n\ncount = (n // 100) * 10 + min(max(d, (n % 100) // 10), 9) + 1 if d == (n % 100) // 10 else 0.\n\nWait, this might be too formulaic, but perhaps I can use a simpler method.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100 pages. So:\n\n- For each hundred (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each, except the last hundred which is incomplete.\n\nSo, for the first four hundreds (1-400), each digit in the tens place appears 4*10=40 times.\n\nNow, from 401-488, which is 88 pages, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, each appearing 9 times because 88 divided by 10 is 8.8, so each digit from 0 to 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place:\n\n- 4 appears 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 401-488) = 49 times\n- 8 appears 40 + 9 = 49 times\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, each digit appears 48 times (from 1-480) plus in the last 8 pages (481-488), 484 has a 4 and 488 has an 8, so units place:\n\n- 4: 48 +1 =49\n- 8: 48 +1=49\n\nIn the hundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times (488-400+1=89)\n- 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because 488 is less than 800.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 187\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 187 -98=89\n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe I made a mistake in the tens place, but after recalculating, it seems correct. So the difference is 89.\n\nBut wait, let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those 89 pages. So 89 times, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total complete sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 sets (480 pages) + 8 extra pages (481-488).\n   - 4 and 8 each appear 48 times in the units place from 1-480.\n   - In the extra pages (481-488), 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total in units place: 49 times each.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - From 1-400: 40 times each for 4 and 8.\n   - From 401-488: Each digit 0-8 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n   - Total in tens place: 49 times each.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - From 1-399: Hundreds digit is 0, 1, 2, or 3, so 4 and 8 do not appear.\n   - From 400-488: Hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n   - Total in hundreds place: 89 times for 4, 0 times for 8.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 187 - 98 = 89\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"
