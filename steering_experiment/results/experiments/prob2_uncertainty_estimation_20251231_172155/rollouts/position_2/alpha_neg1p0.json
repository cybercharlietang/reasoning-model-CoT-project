    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488.\n\nI think the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet's start with the digit 4.\n\nFirst, I'll consider the units place. The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1 to 10, the 4 is in page 4. From 11 to 20, it's in 14, and so on.\n\nNow, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and an additional 8 pages. In each complete block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial block (pages 481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so the digit 4 appears once in 484. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit is 4 for pages 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, from 101 to 200, it's 140-149, another 10 times, and so on.\n\nHow many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? That's 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each complete hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for pages 440-449, which is another 10 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 more. So, total 4's in the tens place would be 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400 to 488. So, how many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place again. Similar to the 4's, in every block of 10, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, in 488 pages, there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and an extra 8 pages. Each block contributes one 8, so that's 48 times. In the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit is 8 for every block of 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, it's 80-89, which is 10 times. Similarly, 101-200, it's 180-189, another 10 times, and so on.\n\nIn 488 pages, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-400) and 88 more pages (401-488). Each complete hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488), but the tens digit is 8 for all of these, so that's 9 times. So, total eights in the tens place would be 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only in the range 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, yes, 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8. From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 times, so 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the units place for 8's. Let me check again. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 pages, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial cycle (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, as I calculated, 49.\n\nSo, total 8's are 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the 8's in the tens place were 49, but let me think again. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 more. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the 4's total was 188 and 8's was 98, so the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the 4's count. Units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when counting digits, especially in the hundreds place, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. Pages 400-488: that's 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these pages has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nSo, 4's: 188, 8's: 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me think again. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 more. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if I should consider that in the range 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 eights. So, yes, 49 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but another way to calculate the number of times a digit appears in a certain position is to use a formula. For example, for the units digit, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is floor(n/10) + (1 if the units digit of n is >= d else 0). Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, for the units digit, the number of times 4 appears is (488 // 10) + (1 if 488 % 10 >=4 else 0). Wait, 488 // 10 is 48, and 488 % 10 is 8, which is >=4, so 48 +1 =49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens digit, the formula is a bit more involved. The number of times a digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to n is calculated by:\n\n- Let high = n // 100\n- Let current = (n // 10) % 10\n- Let low = n % 10\n\nIf current > d, then count += (high + 1) * 10\nIf current == d, count += (high + 1) * 10 + low + 1\nIf current < d, count += high * 10\n\nBut since I'm dealing with digit 8, let's apply this.\n\nFor the tens place, digit d=8.\n\nhigh = 488 // 100 = 4\ncurrent = (488 // 10) % 10 = 48 % 10 = 8\nlow = 488 % 10 = 8\n\nSince current == d (8 ==8), the count is (4 +1)*10 + 8 +1 = 5*10 +9=50+9=59? Wait, that can't be right because earlier I calculated 49.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misapplying the formula. Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the formula. Let me try to apply it correctly.\n\nThe formula for the number of times digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to n is:\n\ncount = 0\n\nFor each position (tens), we can think of it as:\n\n- The higher part is n divided by 100, which gives how many complete hundreds there are.\n- The current digit is (n divided by 10) mod 10.\n- The lower part is n mod 10.\n\nSo, for n=488, d=8.\n\nhigh = 488 // 100 = 4\ncurrent = (488 //10) %10 = 48 %10 =8\nlow = 488 %10 =8\n\nNow, if current > d:\ncount += (high +1)*10\nelif current ==d:\ncount += (high)*10 + low +1\nelse:\ncount += high*10\n\nWait, so in this case, current=8, d=8, so we use the second case:\n\ncount += high*10 + low +1 =4*10 +8 +1=40 +9=49.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the number of times 8 appears in the tens place is 49, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSimilarly, for the units place, digit d=8:\n\nhigh = 488 //100 =4\ncurrent = 488 %10 =8\n\nIf current >8: no\nIf current ==8: yes, so count += high +1=4+1=5. Wait, but earlier I had 49. Wait, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up the formula. Let me check again.\n\nWait, for the units place, the formula is:\n\nnumber of times d appears in units place from 1 to n is:\n\ncount = (n //10) + (1 if (n %10) >=d else 0)\n\nSo, for d=8, n=488:\n\ncount = 488//10=48 + (1 if 8 >=8 else 0)=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, using the formula, we get 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the 4's were 188 and 8's were 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the 4's again.\n\nFor units place, 4's: 49\nTens place: 50\nHundreds place:89\nTotal:49+50+89=188\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. When I calculated the 4's in the tens place, I considered that in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages, so 4*10=40, and then in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 pages, so total 50. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's in the tens place, it's 49, which is correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in the hundreds place, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. Pages 400-488: 488-400+1=89 pages. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, since the book ends at 488, there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place, so zero. So, correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 times (once every 10 pages, plus one in the last partial block).\n- **Tens place:** 50 times (10 times per hundred, plus 10 in the last partial hundred).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 times (pages 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 times (once every 10 pages, plus one in the last partial block).\n- **Tens place:** 49 times (10 times per hundred, plus 9 in the last partial hundred).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 times (no pages 800-899).\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nAlright, I think the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll handle each place for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's:\n\n1. Units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10, and then 8 extra numbers. Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Plus, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (484). So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For every 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). So from 1 to 488, how many hundreds are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds. Each contributes 10 4's, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the last partial hundred (1-88), we need to check how many times the tens digit is 4. From 40-49, that's 10 numbers, so another 10. So total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding them up: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's:\n\n1. Units place: Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once. From 1 to 488, that's 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48. Plus, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once (488). So units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: For the tens digit, every 100 numbers, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89). From 1 to 488, that's 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 8's, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the last partial hundred (1-88), the tens digit 8 appears in 80-88, which is 9 times. So tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only from page 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding them up: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 times the digit 8 appears.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 full decades (1-480) give 48, plus 484 gives +1, total 49.\n- Tens: 4 full centuries (1-400) give 4*10=40, plus 40-49 in 401-488 gives another 10, total 50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89.\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full decades (1-480) give 48, plus 488 gives +1, total 49.\n- Tens: 4 full centuries give 40, plus 80-88 in the last partial century gives 9, total 49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, seems correct. But wait, let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So 89 4's in the hundreds place. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about the hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each starting with 4, so 89 4's. That's right.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place in 4's, in the range 400-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 each hundred. So from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but since 488 is less than 499, does that affect it? Wait, no, because 440-449 is entirely within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place. Wait, but earlier I thought in the tens place, for 4's, it's 10 in each hundred, so 4 hundreds give 40, plus in the last partial hundred (1-88), 40-49 is 10, so total 50. Wait, but from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10, so that's included in the 50 count. So that seems correct.\n\nFor 8's, in the tens place, from 1-488, in each hundred, 80-89 gives 10 8's, so 4 hundreds give 40. Then, in the last partial hundred, 1-88, 80-88 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So 40 + 9 = 49. That seems right.\n\nI think my initial calculation is correct. So the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 188 - 98 = 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Each page number is a number from 1 to 488, and each digit in these numbers can be analyzed separately to count how many times each digit appears.\n\nI think the best approach is to count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately. Let's start by considering each place one by one.\n\nFirst, the units place. For the units digit, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. But wait, actually, from 1 to 10, the digits are 1-9 and then 10, so the units digit for 10 is 0. So, in each block of 10 numbers, the digit 0 appears once, and digits 1-9 appear once each in the units place.\n\nBut wait, when we're dealing with page numbers starting at 1, the first page is 1, so the units digits go from 1 to 9 in the first 9 pages, and then 0 at page 10. So, actually, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place every 10 pages, except that 0 doesn't appear in the units place until page 10. So, for the units digit, the count of each digit (including 4 and 8) will be the same in each 10-page block.\n\nNow, how many complete 10-page blocks are there in 488 pages? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 pages and then 8 more pages. So, in each of these 48 blocks, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears once in the units place. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48, and the number of 8's is also 48.\n\nBut wait, we have 8 more pages beyond the 480th page. Pages 481 to 488. Let's check their units digits: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in the units place, we have another 4 at page 484 and another 8 at page 488. So, that adds one more 4 and one more 8 in the units place. Therefore, total units digit 4's are 48 + 1 = 49, and units digit 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me check again. Each block of 10 pages has exactly one 4 and one 8 in the units place, right? So, 48 blocks would give 48 4's and 48 8's. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1 through 8. So, 484 has a 4 in the units place, and 488 has an 8. So, that's one more 4 and one more 8. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, they are equal.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit changes every 10 pages. So, for example, from 1-9, the tens digit is 0, but since page numbers start at 1, maybe we can consider the tens digit as 0 for pages 1-9. But when counting digits, the tens digit is part of the number, so for page 1, it's 01, but since we're only considering the actual printed page numbers, which don't have leading zeros, the tens digit for pages 1-9 is actually non-existent. Wait, no, the page numbers are just 1, 2, ..., 9, so they don't have a tens digit. So, perhaps the tens digit is 0 for pages 1-9, but since we're not printing leading zeros, the tens digit doesn't appear. So, maybe the tens digit starts from page 10 onwards.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of each page number as a three-digit number, padding with leading zeros if necessary, so that pages 1-9 are 001 to 009, pages 10-99 are 010 to 099, and pages 100-488 are 100 to 488. This way, each page number has three digits, and I can analyze each digit place separately.\n\nSo, if I do that, then for pages 1-9, the tens and hundreds digits are 0, but since they're not printed, maybe I shouldn't count them. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Maybe it's better to consider the actual printed digits. So, for page numbers 1-9, only the units digit is printed, so the tens and hundreds digits don't exist. Therefore, when counting digits, we should only consider the digits that are actually printed.\n\nSo, for the tens place, let's consider when the tens digit is present. That is, when the page number is 10 or higher. So, pages 10-99 have a tens digit, and pages 100-488 have a tens digit as well.\n\nSo, let's first consider the tens place for pages 10-99. Each set of 100 pages (like 1-100) has 10 blocks of 10 pages each, where the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. But wait, in reality, pages 1-9 don't have a tens digit, so from 10 onwards, the tens digit starts appearing.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to think about each digit place separately, considering the full range up to 488.\n\nLet me try to structure this:\n\n1. Units place: count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the units digit from 1 to 488.\n2. Tens place: count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens digit from 1 to 488.\n3. Hundreds place: count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds digit from 1 to 488.\n\nThen, sum them up for each digit and find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nAs before, units digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete 10s are there? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete 10s, and 8 extra numbers.\n\nIn each 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and 8 appears once. So, 48 times each. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, tens place:\n\nThe tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, in each hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nBut since our book goes up to 488, which is less than 500, we need to consider how many hundreds we have.\n\nFirst, let's consider the number of complete hundreds: 4 (since 400 is the start of the 4th hundred). Wait, actually, 488 is in the 4th hundred (400-499), but we only go up to 488, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how many times each digit appears in the tens place.\n\nFor the tens digit, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each hundred. So, for 1-100, the tens digit 0 appears 10 times (pages 1-9 and 10-19?), wait, no. Wait, from 1-9, the tens digit is 0, but since we don't print leading zeros, maybe the tens digit isn't present. Hmm, this is getting confusing again.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider that from 10-99, the tens digit is present, and from 100-488, the tens digit is also present.\n\nSo, from 10-99: 90 numbers. The tens digit cycles from 1 to 9, each appearing 10 times. Wait, no, from 10-19, tens digit is 1; 20-29, tens digit is 2; up to 90-99, tens digit is 9. So, each tens digit from 1-9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place from 10-99.\n\nSimilarly, from 100-488: The tens digit cycles through 0-9 for each hundred. So, for each hundred, each tens digit appears 10 times. But since we're only going up to 488, which is 4 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so the tens digits in 400-488 go from 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). Let me check: 400-409: tens digit 0; 410-419: tens digit 1; ... up to 480-488: tens digit 8. So, the tens digits in 400-488 go from 0-8, each appearing 10 times except for 8, which appears 9 times because we stop at 488.\n\nWait, let me think again. From 400-488, the tens digits are:\n\n- 400-409: tens digit 0 (10 numbers)\n- 410-419: tens digit 1 (10)\n- 420-429: tens digit 2 (10)\n- 430-439: tens digit 3 (10)\n- 440-449: tens digit 4 (10)\n- 450-459: tens digit 5 (10)\n- 460-469: tens digit 6 (10)\n- 470-479: tens digit 7 (10)\n- 480-488: tens digit 8 (9 numbers, since 488 is the 9th number after 480)\n\nSo, for the tens digit in 400-488, each digit from 0-7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, now, let's calculate the total number of times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nFrom 10-99: Each digit 1-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\nFrom 100-399: Each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) has each digit 0-9 appearing 10 times in the tens place. So, for each hundred, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times. Since there are 3 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), that's 3*10=30 times for 4 and 30 times for 8.\n\nFrom 400-488: As above, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 10 (from 10-99) + 30 (from 100-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 50.\n\nTotal tens place 8's: 10 (from 10-99) + 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 49.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nThe hundreds digit is only present from page 100 onwards. So, from 1-99, there is no hundreds digit. From 100-488, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- 100-199: hundreds digit 1 (100 times)\n- 200-299: hundreds digit 2 (100 times)\n- 300-399: hundreds digit 3 (100 times)\n- 400-488: hundreds digit 4 (89 times, since 488-400+1=89)\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Only in 400-488, which is 89 times.\n\nHow many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? Zero, because the hundreds digit never reaches 8 in a 488-page book. The highest hundreds digit is 4 (for 400-488).\n\nSo, hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n- 48 complete 10s: 48 4's and 48 8's\n- Remaining 8 pages: 484 and 488 add 1 each\n- Total: 49 each. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- 10-99: 10 each\n- 100-399: 3 hundreds, 10 each, so 30 each\n- 400-488: 10 for 4, 9 for 8\n- Total 4's: 10 + 30 + 10 = 50\n- Total 8's: 10 + 30 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488)\n- 8 appears 0 times. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - 48 complete blocks of 10 pages: 48 occurrences each of 4 and 8.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488): 1 more 4 (484) and 1 more 8 (488).\n   - Total: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - From 10-99: Each digit 1-9 appears 10 times.\n   - From 100-399: Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times per hundred, so 3 hundreds give 30 each.\n   - From 400-488: 4 appears 10 times (440-449), 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 appears 0 times.\n   - Total: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\n**Total Counts**:\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference**: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI think the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll go through each place one by one for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's.\n\nStarting with the units place: The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1 to 10, the 4 is in page 4. From 11 to 20, it's in page 14, and so on. \n\nNow, since the book has 488 pages, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). \n\nIn each complete block, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So for 48 blocks, that's 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So here, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (page 484). So total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit is 4 in the numbers 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, from 101 to 200, it's 140-149, another 10 times, and so on.\n\nSo, how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 extra pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in the numbers 440-449. That's another 10 times. Wait, but 488 is less than 490, so 440-449 is within 401-488. So that's another 10. So total in tens place is 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check that again. From 401 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So yes, that's correct. So total tens place 4's are 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400 to 488. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (including both 400 and 488). So the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. The hundreds digit is 4 starting at 400 and goes up to 488. So 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So yes, 89 times.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me recount. From 400 to 488, how many numbers? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So yes, 89 times. So units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. So total 4's: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, in every block of 10, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10? 48 complete blocks (as before) with 8 extra numbers.\n\nIn each block, 8 appears once, so 48 times. In the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once in 488. So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, tens place: The tens digit is 8 in the numbers 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but let me think carefully.\n\nEach hundred block has a set where the tens digit is 8. For example, in 1-100, it's 80-89, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in 101-200, it's 180-189, another 10. In 201-300, 280-289, another 10. In 301-400, 380-389, another 10. Now, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So that's 9 instead of 10.\n\nSo total tens place 8's: 10 (from 1-100) + 10 (101-200) + 10 (201-300) + 10 (301-400) + 9 (401-488) = 10*4 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers, right? 480, 481, ..., 488. So yes, 9 times. So total tens place 8's: 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So the hundreds place contributes 0 to the count of 8's.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me double-check the tens place for 8's. Because in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So that's correct. So total tens place 8's: 49.\n\nSo total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place was 49 and tens place was 49, so 98 in total. But let me check the units place again.\n\nUnits place for 8's: In each block of 10, 8 appears once. There are 48 complete blocks (1-480), each contributing one 8, so 48. Then in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSo total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nNow, total 4's were 188, and total 8's are 98. So the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again, because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, when I calculated the 4's in the hundreds place, I got 89, which seems high. Let me think again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So that's correct. So 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4's, I had 50. Let me check that again. Each hundred block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So 40 + 10 = 50. That's correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 49, which is correct as well.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 49, tens place: 49, so total 98.\n\nSo the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is that correct? Because 4's in hundreds place are 89, which is a lot. Let me see: 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this using a formula or a more systematic method to avoid mistakes.\n\nAnother way is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor a number with n digits, the count of a digit d in each position can be calculated based on higher digits, current digit, and lower digits.\n\nBut maybe that's overcomplicating. Let me try to recount for 4's.\n\nUnits place: For each 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So total number of units places is 488 / 10 = 48.8, which means 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48, plus the remaining 8 numbers (481-488). In these, units digit 4 appears once (484). So total 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For each 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So in each 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48, plus the last 8 numbers where 8 appears once (488). So 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: In each 100, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, etc. So 4 full hundreds contribute 10 each, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me try a different approach. Maybe using a formula for digit counting.\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears from 1 to N can be calculated by considering each digit position separately.\n\nFor the units place:\n- The number of times d appears is floor(N / 10) + min(max(N % 10 - d + 1, 0), 1).\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to think of it as:\n\nFor each position (units, tens, hundreds), the count is calculated based on higher digits, current digit, and lower digits.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to stick with the initial method since it's straightforward for this problem.\n\nSo, after double-checking, I'm confident that the number of 4's is 188 and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** \n     - Every 10 numbers contribute one 4. There are 48 full decades (1-480), contributing 48 fours. The last 8 numbers (481-488) include one more 4 (484). Total: 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** \n     - Every 100 numbers have 10 fours in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). There are 4 full centuries (1-400), contributing 40 fours. The last 88 numbers (401-488) include another 10 fours (440-449). Total: 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** \n     - From 400 to 488, there are 89 numbers with 4 in the hundreds place. Total: 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** \n     - Similar to 4's, 48 full decades contribute 48 eights. The last 8 numbers include one more 8 (488). Total: 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** \n     - Every 100 numbers have 10 eights in the tens place. Four centuries contribute 40. The last 88 numbers include 9 eights (480-488). Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** \n     - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place. Total: 0.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number, right?\n\nWait, but since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers will be from 1 to 488, which means they can be one-digit (1-9), two-digit (10-99), or three-digit (100-488). I should probably consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nI think the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each place (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for the digit 8, then subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every group of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. How many such groups are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, there are 48 full groups of 10 and then a partial group of 8 numbers (481-488). So, in each full group, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the partial group from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, from 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10 numbers, and so on. Let's see how many full hundreds are there in 488.\n\n488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399. Each of these has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, the remaining pages are 400-488. In this range, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, adding that, the total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers are there here? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's printed are 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Again, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, as before, there are 48 full groups of 10 in 480, and then 8 more in 481-488. So, 48 full groups give 48 8's, and in the partial group, units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once (488). So, total 8's in units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each such range has 10 numbers. Let's see how many full hundreds we have in 488.\n\nFrom 0-99, 80-89: 10 numbers. From 100-199, 180-189: another 10. From 200-299, 280-289: 10. From 300-399, 380-389: 10. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, we have 4 full hundreds contributing 10 each, so 4*10=40, plus 9 in the last partial hundred. So, total 8's in tens place are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page numbers are from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 full groups (1-480) give 48 4's, and 484 adds 1 more, so 49.\n- Tens: 4 full hundreds (0-399) each have 10, so 40, plus 440-449 in 400-488, which is 10, so 50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full groups (1-480) give 48 8's, and 488 adds 1 more, so 49.\n- Tens: 4 full hundreds (0-399) each have 10, so 40, plus 480-488, which is 9, so 49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full groups of 10 (1-480) contribute 48 occurrences, plus one in 484, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 full hundreds (0-399) contribute 40, plus 10 in 440-449, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 contributes 89 occurrences.\n  \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full groups (1-480) contribute 48, plus one in 488, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 full hundreds contribute 40, plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Each page number is a number from 1 to 488, and each digit in these numbers can be a 4 or an 8. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears and how many times 8 appears, then subtract the two to find the difference.\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding the structure of the page numbers. Page numbers can be one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit numbers. Specifically, from 1 to 9, they're single-digit; from 10 to 99, they're two-digit; and from 100 to 488, they're three-digit numbers. I think I'll need to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each of these ranges separately.\n\nFirst, let's handle the single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digits that can be 4 or 8 are only 4 and 8 themselves. So, the page number 4 will have one 4, and the page number 8 will have one 8. So, in single-digit pages, there's 1 four and 1 eight. That means the difference so far is 0.\n\nNext, let's move on to the two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I'll need to consider both places separately for each digit (4 and 8).\n\nStarting with the tens place: For the tens digit, the possible numbers are 1 to 9. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Well, from 40 to 49, each of these ten numbers has a 4 in the tens place. So that's 10 fours. Similarly, for 8 in the tens place, from 80 to 89, that's another 10 eights.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers: For each ten's group (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each ten's group, the digit 4 appears once (like 14, 24, etc.), and the digit 8 appears once (like 18, 28, etc.). Since there are 9 ten's groups (from 10-19 up to 90-99), each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, that's 9 fours and 9 eights.\n\nSo, combining the tens and units places for two-digit numbers, the total number of fours is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 fours. Similarly, the total number of eights is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 eights. So, in two-digit pages, the count for 4 and 8 is equal, so the difference remains 0.\n\nNow, moving on to the three-digit page numbers, which range from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because each page number has a hundreds place, a tens place, and a units place. I'll need to consider each digit position separately for both 4 and 8.\n\nLet's start with the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book has 488 pages. So, the hundreds digit cycles from 1 to 4. How many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0 to 9, and this applies to each hundreds group. So, for each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place across all these groups.\n\nStarting with the first three hundreds groups (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each of these has 100 numbers. In each of these, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times (since each ten's group has 10 numbers). So, in each hundreds group, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (like 140-149, 240-249, etc.), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (like 180-189, 280-289, etc.).\n\nSo, for each of the first three hundreds groups, that's 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. Since there are three such groups, that's 3 * 10 = 30 fours and 3 * 10 = 30 eights.\n\nNow, for the last hundreds group, which is 400-488. The tens digit here goes from 0 to 8 because 488 is the last page. So, the tens digits are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Wait, but actually, from 400 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, but each ten's group has 10 numbers except possibly the last one if it's cut short. Let's check: 400-409, 410-419, ..., up to 480-488. So, the tens digits are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Each of these tens digits appears 10 times except for the last one, 8, which only appears 9 times because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers, but wait, 488 - 480 +1 = 9). Hmm, so in the tens place for 400-488, the digit 8 appears only once in the tens place? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.\n\nWait, when we're looking at the tens place, for each hundreds group, the tens digit cycles 0-9, but in 400-488, the hundreds digit is fixed at 4, and the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, because 488 is the last page. So, the tens digits in 400-488 are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Each of these digits appears 10 times except for the last one, which is 8, because from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, right? Because 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, meaning the tens digit 8 appears only 9 times, not 10. So, in the tens place for 400-488, the digit 8 appears 9 times, while all other digits (including 4) appear 10 times.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Let me clarify. For the hundreds group 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. For each tens digit, except for 8, there are 10 numbers. But for the tens digit 8, it's only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (like 440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, in the tens place for 400-488, we have 10 fours and 9 eights.\n\nTherefore, for the tens place across all three-digit numbers:\n\n- First three hundreds groups (100-199, 200-299, 300-399): 30 fours and 30 eights.\n- Fourth hundreds group (400-488): 10 fours and 9 eights.\n\nSo, total fours in the tens place: 30 + 10 = 40.\nTotal eights in the tens place: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but that seems off because 30 fours from the first three groups and 10 from the fourth, so 40 fours. Similarly, 30 eights from the first three and 9 from the fourth, so 39 eights. So, in the tens place, fours are more by 1.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. For the first three groups, each contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place, so 3*10=30 each. Then, in the 400-488 group, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, yes, that's correct: 10 fours and 9 eights. So, total fours in tens place: 30+10=40; eights: 30+9=39. So, in the tens place, fours are 1 more than eights.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, we'll consider each hundreds group separately.\n\nStarting with the first three hundreds groups (100-199, 200-299, 300-399). Each of these has 100 numbers, so for each group, the units digit cycles 0-9 ten times (once for each ten's group). So, in each group, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the units place (like 104,114,...,194), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (like 108,118,...,198). Since there are three such groups, that's 3*10=30 fours and 3*10=30 eights.\n\nNow, for the last hundreds group, 400-488. The units digit here cycles 0-9 for each ten's group, except the last one, which is cut short at 488. So, let's break it down:\n\nFrom 400-409: units digits 0-9, so 4 and 8 each appear once.\nSimilarly, 410-419: same, 4 and 8 each appear once.\nContinuing this way up to 470-479: same, 4 and 8 each appear once.\nThen, 480-488: units digits 0-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). Wait, but 488 is the last page, so units digit 8 appears once here as well.\n\nWait, let me count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the units place for 400-488.\n\nEach ten's group from 400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479: that's 8 ten's groups (from 40 to 47 in the tens place). Each of these contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so that's 8 fours and 8 eights.\n\nThen, the last ten's group is 480-488, which has units digits from 0 to 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, that's 1 four and 1 eight.\n\nSo, total fours in the units place for 400-488: 8 + 1 = 9.\nTotal eights in the units place: 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. From 400-409: units digits 0-9, so 4 appears once (404), 8 appears once (408).\nSimilarly, 410-419: 414 and 418.\nContinuing up to 470-479: 474 and 478.\nThat's 8 ten's groups (400-409 up to 470-479), each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 8 fours and 8 eights.\n\nThen, 480-488: units digits 0-8. So, 484 (units digit 4) and 488 (units digit 8). So, that's 1 four and 1 eight.\n\nSo, total fours in units place for 400-488: 8 + 1 = 9.\nTotal eights: 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nSo, in the units place for 400-488, we have 9 fours and 9 eights.\n\nTherefore, across all three-digit numbers:\n\n- Units place in first three hundreds groups: 30 fours and 30 eights.\n- Units place in 400-488: 9 fours and 9 eights.\n\nSo, total fours in units place: 30 + 9 = 39.\nTotal eights in units place: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, in the units place, fours and eights are equal.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the fours and eights across all digit positions.\n\nFirst, for fours:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: hundreds place 89, tens place 40, units place 39\nTotal fours = 1 + 19 + 89 + 40 + 39. Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, we've already broken down the hundreds, tens, and units places. So, for three-digit numbers, the total fours would be the sum of fours in each place.\n\nSimilarly, for two-digit numbers, we have 19 fours, and single-digit has 1 four.\n\nWait, no, let's correct this. Let me structure it properly.\n\nTotal fours:\n\n- Single-digit: 1 (page 4)\n- Two-digit: 19 (as calculated earlier)\n- Three-digit: hundreds place 89, tens place 40, units place 39. So, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, but wait, 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168 fours in three-digit numbers.\n\nSo, total fours: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188 fours.\n\nSimilarly, total eights:\n\n- Single-digit: 1 (page 8)\n- Two-digit: 19 (as calculated earlier)\n- Three-digit: hundreds place 0, tens place 39, units place 39. So, 0 + 39 + 39 = 78 eights.\n\nWait, let me check that again. In three-digit numbers, for eights:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0\n- Tens place: 39 (from earlier calculation)\n- Units place: 39 (from earlier calculation)\nSo, total eights in three-digit numbers: 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nSo, total eights: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98 eights.\n\nWait, but let me cross-verify this because earlier when calculating the tens place for three-digit numbers, I had 39 eights, and units place also 39 eights, so 78 in total. Adding the single and two-digit eights, which are 1 and 19 respectively, gives 98 eights.\n\nWait, but earlier in the tens place for three-digit numbers, I had 39 eights, which was 30 from the first three hundreds groups and 9 from the 400-488 group, totaling 39. Similarly, in the units place, it was 39 eights. So, 39 + 39 = 78 eights in three-digit numbers.\n\nSo, total eights: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\nNow, total fours: 188, total eights: 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the three-digit counts.\n\nWait, in the three-digit hundreds place, we have 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.\n\nIn the tens place, for three-digit numbers:\n\n- First three hundreds groups: 30 fours\n- 400-488: 10 fours\nTotal: 40 fours.\n\nIn the units place:\n\n- First three hundreds groups: 30 fours\n- 400-488: 9 fours\nTotal: 39 fours.\n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 fours in three-digit numbers.\n\nAdding single and two-digit fours: 1 + 19 = 20. So, total fours: 20 + 168 = 188.\n\nFor eights:\n\nIn three-digit numbers:\n\n- Tens place: 39 eights\n- Units place: 39 eights\nTotal: 78 eights.\n\nAdding single and two-digit eights: 1 + 19 = 20. So, total eights: 20 + 78 = 98.\n\nSo, difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I missed any numbers. For example, in the three-digit numbers, when considering the units place in 400-488, I had 9 fours and 9 eights. Let me confirm that.\n\nFrom 400-488, each ten's group from 400-409 to 470-479 contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place, which is 8 groups, so 8 fours and 8 eights. Then, in 480-488, units digits go up to 8, so 484 and 488, which are 1 four and 1 eight. So, total 9 fours and 9 eights in the units place for 400-488. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place for 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, that's 10 fours and 9 eights.\n\nSo, adding up, the counts seem accurate.\n\nTherefore, the total number of fours printed is 188, and the total number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check once more to ensure I didn't make a miscalculation. Sometimes when adding up, it's easy to make an error.\n\nTotal fours:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\nTotal: 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 168 = 188.\n\nTotal eights:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\nTotal: 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 78 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the number of fours printed is 90 more than the number of eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to 8's. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Single-Digit Pages (1-9):**\n   - 4 appears once (page 4).\n   - 8 appears once (page 8).\n   - Difference: 0.\n\n2. **Two-Digit Pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - 4 appears 10 times (40-49).\n     - 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Each ten's group (10-19, 20-29, etc.) contributes one 4 and one 8, totaling 9 fours and 9 eights.\n   - **Total:**\n     - 19 fours and 19 eights.\n   - Difference: 0.\n\n3. **Three-Digit Pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n     - 8 appears 0 times.\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - First three hundreds (100-399): 30 fours, 30 eights.\n     - 400-488: 10 fours, 9 eights.\n     - **Total:** 40 fours, 39 eights.\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - First three hundreds: 30 fours, 30 eights.\n     - 400-488: 9 fours, 9 eights.\n     - **Total:** 39 fours, 39 eights.\n   - **Total for Three-Digit:**\n     - Fours: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n     - Eights: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n\n4. **Total Across All Pages:**\n   - **Fours:** 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n   - **Eights:** 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n   - **Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number, right? Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488.\n\nI think the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll handle each place one by one for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place.\n   - How many such blocks are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then an extra 8 numbers (481-488).\n   - So, in each full block, there's one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 times.\n   - Now, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once here as well (page 484).\n   - Total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n   - How many full hundreds are there in 488? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block from 401-488.\n   - In each full hundred, there's one block of 10 where the tens digit is 4, so that's 10 occurrences per hundred. So, 4 hundreds give 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - Now, in the partial block 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-409, 1 for 410-419, ..., up to 8 for 480-488. But the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449. However, since the book ends at 488, 440-449 is entirely within 401-488. So, that's another 10 occurrences.\n   - Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 more. So total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 401-488 includes 401 to 488, so 440-449 is indeed part of that. So, yes, 10 more. So total 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for all page numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.\n   - So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, when I calculated the hundreds place, I considered that from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nBut let me double-check the tens place. From 1-400, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's 10 times per hundred, so 4 times 10 is 40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. So, 40 + 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48, plus the last partial block (481-488) which includes 484, so 1 more. So 49. So total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, in each block of 10, 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - Number of full blocks: 48, each contributing 1, so 48.\n   - Last partial block: 481-488. The units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (page 488).\n   - Total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In each block of 100, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n   - Number of full hundreds: 4, each contributing 10, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - Now, in the partial block 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480-488), but since 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all, so that's 9 occurrences, but wait, 480-488 is actually 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, the tens digit is 8 in all of these, so that's 9 times.\n   - Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, so that's 9 occurrences. So, total tens place 8's: 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but hold on, 480-488 is part of the 401-488 block, right? So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 occurrences. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is never 8. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For the tens place, in the partial block 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, yes, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations because 188 - 98 is 90, but I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's and 8's.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus in 481-488, 484 has a 4 in units, so 1. Total 49.\n- Tens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Plus in 401-488, 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10. Total 50.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus 488, so 1. Total 49.\n- Tens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Plus in 401-488, 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9. Total 49.\n- Hundreds place: 0.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe I missed something in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check that again.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's. That's correct.\n\nAnd for the 8's, the hundreds place doesn't contribute anything because the book ends at 488, so no page numbers in the 800s. So, 0.\n\nAnother way to check is to consider that up to page 488, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400 onwards, which is correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the tens place for 8's again. In the partial block 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 occurrences. So, 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nI think my calculations are correct, so the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nAlright, so I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense. \n\nLet me start by considering the positions where the digits can appear: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I think I should calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position separately and then add them up. \n\nFirst, let's handle the units place. For the units digit, every 10 numbers, the digit cycles through 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once (like 4, 14, 24, etc.) and the digit 8 appears once (like 8, 18, 28, etc.). \n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra numbers. So, in each complete block, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Therefore, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48, and the number of 8's is also 48. But wait, I need to check those extra 8 numbers. The last partial block is from 481 to 488. In the units place of these, the digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). So, adding those, the total 4's in units place are 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that can't be right because 488 is included, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, yes, both 4's and 8's in units place are 49 each. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure. \n\nWait, no, actually, when I calculated 48 blocks, each contributing one 4 and one 8, that's correct. Then, the last partial block from 481 to 488: the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, they are equal. \n\nNext, let's move to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers. So, for example, from 0-9, the tens digit is 0; 10-19, it's 1; and so on. So, in each block of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (40-49), and similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (80-89). \n\nNow, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 numbers (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and the tens digit 8 appears 10 times. So, for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times for 4's and 4 * 10 = 40 times for 8's. \n\nNow, the partial hundred from 401 to 488. Let's look at the tens place here. The tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? From 440-449, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, how many times does 8 appear? From 480-488, the tens digit is 8, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. \n\nWait, let me confirm. Pages 480-488: the tens digit is 8 for all these pages. So, 480 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, how many pages is that? From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 pages (since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the partial hundred. \n\nSimilarly, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, in the partial hundred, 4's in the tens place: 10 times, and 8's in the tens place: 9 times. \n\nSo, adding up: total 4's in tens place = 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from partial hundred) = 50. Total 8's in tens place = 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 (from partial hundred) = 49. \n\nWait, that seems correct. So, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 49 times. \n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers 100 and above. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's 0. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4. \n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the pages 400-488. Let's see how many pages that is. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. \n\nWhat about the hundreds digit being 8? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. The highest hundreds digit is 4. So, the hundreds digit 8 doesn't appear at all. \n\nTherefore, the number of 4's in the hundreds place is 89, and the number of 8's is 0. \n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit position. \n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, 98 8's.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, units place: 49 4's and 49 8's. That seems correct because each block of 10 contributes one each, and the last partial block adds one more each.\n\nTens place: 50 4's and 49 8's. That's because in the partial hundred, 4's have a full 10 pages, while 8's have only 9. So, 40 +10=50 for 4's, and 40 +9=49 for 8's.\n\nHundreds place: 89 4's and 0 8's. Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit 8 doesn't appear.\n\nAdding them up: 49+50+89=188 for 4's, and 49+49+0=98 for 8's.\n\nSubtracting: 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't overcount or undercount in any position.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have units digits from 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place total 4's: 48+1=49, same for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, each full hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens digit. So, 4 hundreds contribute 40 each. Then, the partial hundred from 401-488: the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, 40+10=50 for 4's, and 40+9=49 for 8's. That looks correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 pages where the hundreds digit is 4. Since the book doesn't go beyond 488, there are no pages where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 89 4's and 0 8's. Correct.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems right. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately:\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes one '4' and one '8'.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks (480 numbers) and 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n   - In the units place: 48 '4's and 48 '8's from complete blocks, plus 1 each from the extra numbers.\n   - Total: 49 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 '4's and 10 '8's in the tens place.\n   - There are 4 complete hundreds (400 numbers) and 88 extra numbers (401-488).\n   - From complete hundreds: 40 '4's and 40 '8's.\n   - In the extra numbers, '4' appears 10 times (440-449), and '8' appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is '4' for pages 400-488 (89 pages).\n   - There are no pages where the hundreds digit is '8'.\n   - Total: 89 '4's and 0 '8's.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number is a three-digit number, right? Because the book goes up to 488, so the first few pages are 1, 2, 3, ..., then 10, 11, and so on up to 488. Wait, actually, page 1 is just a single digit, page 10 is two digits, and from page 100 onwards, it's three digits. So maybe I should consider single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit page numbers separately.\n\nLet me start by considering single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digits 4 and 8 each appear once. So for single-digit pages, both 4 and 8 occur once. So the count for 4's is 1, and for 8's is also 1. So the difference here is 0. \n\nNext, let's look at two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nStarting with the tens place for two-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 1 through 9. For each tens digit, there are 10 possible units digits (0 through 9). So, for the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, when the tens digit is 4, the units can be 0-9, so that's 10 times. Similarly, when the tens digit is 8, that's another 10 times. So in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 10 times.\n\nNow for the units place in two-digit numbers. For each set of ten numbers (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So for each ten, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 appears once. Since there are 9 sets of ten in two-digit numbers (10-99), that's 9 times for each digit. So in the units place, 4 appears 9 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nAdding up the tens and units places for two-digit numbers: 4 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times, and 8 appears 10 + 9 = 19 times. So the difference for two-digit pages is 19 - 19 = 0.\n\nSo far, from pages 1 to 99, the number of 4's and 8's are equal. Now, I need to consider the three-digit page numbers from 100 to 488. This is where things might get a bit more complicated because we have hundreds, tens, and units digits to consider.\n\nLet me break this down into hundreds, tens, and units places separately.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book has 488 pages. So let's consider each hundreds digit:\n\n- When the hundreds digit is 1 (pages 100-199): The hundreds digit is 1, so neither 4 nor 8 appears here. So for 4's and 8's in the hundreds place, nothing is added here.\n- When the hundreds digit is 2 (pages 200-299): Similarly, hundreds digit is 2, so no 4's or 8's here.\n- When the hundreds digit is 3 (pages 300-399): Hundreds digit is 3, so again, no 4's or 8's.\n- When the hundreds digit is 4 (pages 400-488): Here, the hundreds digit is 4. So every page from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many pages is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all in three-digit numbers because the highest page is 488, so hundreds digits are only 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nSo in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0-9 for each hundreds group. Let's consider each hundreds group separately.\n\n- Hundreds digit 1 (100-199): The tens digit can be 0-9. For each tens digit, the units digit cycles 0-9. So how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? When the tens digit is 4, that's 10 times (140-149). Similarly, when the tens digit is 8, that's another 10 times (180-189). So for hundreds digit 1, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2 (200-299): Same logic as above. Tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (240-249), and tens digit 8 occurs 10 times (280-289).\n\n- Hundreds digit 3 (300-399): Again, tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (340-349), and tens digit 8 occurs 10 times (380-389).\n\n- Hundreds digit 4 (400-488): Now, this is a bit different because the hundreds digit is 4, and the page numbers go up to 488, so the tens digit can only go up to 8. So for tens digits 0-8, each tens digit has 10 numbers, except for the last one, which might be shorter.\n\nWait, let me think. From 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Each tens digit from 0 to 8 has 10 units digits, except for the last one, which is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. But wait, 480 to 489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9.\n\nSo for the hundreds digit 4:\n\n- Tens digit 0: 400-409 (10 numbers)\n- Tens digit 1: 410-419 (10)\n- ...\n- Tens digit 8: 480-488 (9 numbers)\n\nSo when the tens digit is 4 in the hundreds digit 4 group, that's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, when the tens digit is 8, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo in the tens place for hundreds digit 4:\n\n- 4 appears 10 times (440-449)\n- 8 appears 9 times (480-488)\n\nSo adding up all the hundreds groups:\n\n- For 4's in the tens place: 10 (hundreds 1) + 10 (hundreds 2) + 10 (hundreds 3) + 10 (hundreds 4) = 40 times\n- For 8's in the tens place: 10 (hundreds 1) + 10 (hundreds 2) + 10 (hundreds 3) + 9 (hundreds 4) = 39 times\n\nSo the difference in the tens place is 40 - 39 = 1.\n\nNow, let's move on to the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, considering each hundreds group:\n\nFor each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the units digit cycles from 0-9 for each tens digit.\n\nIn each hundreds group, for each tens digit, the units digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers, and similarly for 8.\n\nLet me calculate for each hundreds group:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1 (100-199): There are 10 tens digits (0-9), each with 10 units digits. So for each tens digit, units digit 4 appears once, so total 10 times. Similarly, units digit 8 appears 10 times.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2 (200-299): Same as above, 10 times for 4's and 10 times for 8's.\n\n- Hundreds digit 3 (300-399): Same, 10 times each.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4 (400-488): Now, here, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but the units digits still cycle 0-9 for each tens digit, except when the tens digit is 8, where the units only go up to 8.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the units digits for each tens digit in the hundreds digit 4 group are as follows:\n\n- For tens digits 0-7: Each has 10 units digits (0-9)\n- For tens digit 8: Units digits go from 0-8 (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo for units digit 4 in hundreds digit 4 group:\n\n- For tens digits 0-7: Each has a units digit 4 once, so that's 8 tens digits * 1 = 8\n- For tens digit 8: Units digit 4 appears once at 484\n\nWait, but 484 is within 480-488, so yes, it exists. So total units digit 4's in hundreds digit 4 group: 8 + 1 = 9\n\nSimilarly, for units digit 8 in hundreds digit 4 group:\n\n- For tens digits 0-7: Each has a units digit 8 once, so 8 times\n- For tens digit 8: Units digit 8 appears at 488, which is one time\n\nSo total units digit 8's: 8 + 1 = 9\n\nWait, but wait, let me think again. For each tens digit from 0-7, units digits 0-9, so units digit 4 appears once per tens digit, so 8 tens digits (0-7) each contribute 1, so 8. Then for tens digit 8, units digits go up to 8, so units digit 4 appears once at 484, and units digit 8 appears once at 488. So yes, units digit 4: 8 + 1 = 9, and units digit 8: 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nWait, but wait, when the tens digit is 8, the units digits go from 0-8, so units digit 8 appears once, at 488. Similarly, units digit 4 appears once at 484.\n\nSo for the units place:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 10\n- Hundreds digit 2: 10\n- Hundreds digit 3: 10\n- Hundreds digit 4: 9 for 4's and 9 for 8's\n\nSo total units digit 4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\nTotal units digit 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n\nWait, that's interesting. So in the units place, both 4's and 8's appear 39 times each.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. For hundreds digit 4, units digit 4 appears 9 times, so total 10*3 + 9 = 39, and same for 8's. So yes, 39 each.\n\nSo now, adding up all the places for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0\n- Tens place: 4's = 40, 8's = 39\n- Units place: 4's = 39, 8's = 39\n\nSo total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\nTotal 8's in three-digit numbers: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, in the tens place, I had:\n\n- 4's: 10 (hundreds 1) + 10 (hundreds 2) + 10 (hundreds 3) + 10 (hundreds 4) = 40\n- 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n\nAnd in the units place:\n\n- 4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n- 8's: same as 4's, 39\n\nSo total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\nTotal 8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n\nSo the difference in three-digit numbers is 168 - 78 = 90\n\nNow, adding up all the digits from single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers:\n\n- Single-digit: 4's = 1, 8's = 1, difference 0\n- Two-digit: 4's = 19, 8's = 19, difference 0\n- Three-digit: 4's = 168, 8's = 78, difference 90\n\nSo total difference is 0 + 0 + 90 = 90\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check the three-digit counts because that seems like a big difference. Let me recalculate the three-digit counts.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears 89 times (from 400-488)\n- 8 appears 0 times\n\nTens place:\n- For hundreds 1, 2, 3: each has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place\n- For hundreds 4: 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488)\nSo total 4's in tens place: 3*10 + 10 = 40\nTotal 8's in tens place: 3*10 + 9 = 39\n\nUnits place:\n- For hundreds 1, 2, 3: each has 10 4's and 10 8's in the units place\n- For hundreds 4: 9 4's and 9 8's\nSo total 4's in units place: 3*10 + 9 = 39\nTotal 8's in units place: same as 4's, 39\n\nSo total 4's in three-digit: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\nTotal 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\nDifference: 168 - 78 = 90\n\nAdding to single and two-digit, which had no difference, total difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The total number of 4's is 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188\nTotal number of 8's is 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the number of times the digits 4 and 8 appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - Both 4 and 8 appear once.\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - Tens place: 4 and 8 each appear 10 times.\n   - Units place: 4 and 8 each appear 9 times.\n   - Total: 19 each.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:**\n     - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n     - 8 appears 0 times.\n   - **Tens place:**\n     - 4 appears 40 times.\n     - 8 appears 39 times.\n   - **Units place:**\n     - 4 appears 39 times.\n     - 8 appears 39 times.\n   - **Total:**\n     - 4: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n     - 8: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\n4. **Total counts:**\n   - 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n   - 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nAlright, so I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to get the difference. That makes sense.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll do this for both 4 and 8.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's.\n\n1. **Units place:** The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So in every set of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. How many such sets are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 times, and then in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit is 1-8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So total units place 4's: 48.\n\nWait, actually, when I think about it, the last set is 481-490, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 481-488. So, in the units place, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1 to 8, so no 4 there. So yes, 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, in 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10 times, and so on. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? From 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440 is within 401-488, so that's another 10 times. Wait, but 440 is 440, and 449 is 449, so that's 10 numbers. So total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check that. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 tens place 4's, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-409) to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 more. So total 50. That seems correct.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, but hold on. The hundreds digit is 4 only for numbers 400-499, but since the book stops at 488, it's 400-488, which is indeed 89 numbers. So, 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, in each set of 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, up to 488, how many full sets of 10 are there? 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once more (at 488). So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** For the tens digit, in each hundred, 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers: e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, in each hundred, that's 10 times. How many hundreds are there in 488? 4 full hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes up to 8 (480-488). So, in this range, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 480 is included, and 488 is the last). Wait, but from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me confirm. From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 tens place 8's, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems right.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no hundreds place 8's. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that's 49 in units, 49 in tens, and 0 in hundreds, so 98 total 8's.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98.\n\nLet me do that subtraction: 187 - 98. Hmm, 187 minus 100 would be 87, but since it's 98, which is 2 less than 100, so 87 + 2 = 89. So, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, let me check that again: 187 - 98. 98 + 89 = 187? Let's see: 98 + 80 = 178, plus 9 is 187. Yes, correct. So, the difference is 89.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the counts for 4's and 8's to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 48 times. Correct, because 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4 in units.\n- Tens: 50 times. Wait, earlier I thought 4 in tens place occurs 10 times per hundred, so 4 hundreds give 40, plus in 401-488, 440-449 is another 10, so 50. That seems correct.\n- Hundreds: 89 times, from 400-488. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That's correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49 times. 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, plus one more in 488. So 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n- Tens: 49 times. 4 full hundreds give 40, plus in 401-488, 480-488 gives 9 more, totaling 49. Correct.\n- Hundreds: 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Correct.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89. So, 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, 9 times, which is correct. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times, adding to the 40 from the first four hundreds, making 50. Correct.\n\nAnd for the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, from 400 to 488. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the difference is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Count the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** In every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. There are 48 full sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 times. The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) don't add any 4's in the units place. Total: 48.\n   - **Tens place:** In every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For 400 numbers, this is 40 times. Additionally, in 401-488, 440-449 adds 10 more. Total: 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, 4 appears in the hundreds place for 89 numbers. Total: 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n2. **Count the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** In every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. There are 48 full sets, contributing 48 times. The remaining 8 numbers include 488, adding one more. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens place:** In every 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times. For 400 numbers, this is 40 times. In 401-488, 480-488 adds 9 more. Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place up to 488. Total: 0.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Each page number is a three-digit number, right? From 1 to 488. Wait, actually, page 1 is just '1', page 10 is '10', and so on, up to page 488. So, the page numbers can be one, two, or three digits long. \n\nI think the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for the digit 8, then subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense because each digit's occurrence can be counted separately based on their place value.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits go from 1 to 0. The digit 4 appears once in the units place (page 4), and the digit 8 appears once (page 8). This pattern repeats every 10 pages. \n\nSo, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra pages. In each complete set of 10, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for the units place, the total number of 4's would be 48 times 1, which is 48, plus any additional 4's in the remaining 8 pages. Wait, in the remaining pages from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so page 484 would have a 4 in the units place. So, that's one more 4. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. \n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, each set of 10 has one 8, so 48 times 1 is 48, and in the remaining 8 pages, page 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more, making it 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each cycle of 100 pages has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89). \n\nNow, how many complete sets of 100 are there in 488 pages? 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, there are 4 complete sets and then 88 extra pages. \n\nIn each complete set of 100, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4 sets would have 4*10 = 40 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times per set, so 4*10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, let's check the remaining 88 pages, from 401 to 488. Wait, actually, after 400 pages, the next set is 401-500, but since we only go up to 488, we have to consider pages 401-488. \n\nIn the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place in this range.\n\nFor the digit 4 in the tens place: The pages where the tens digit is 4 are from 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 pages. So, that's 10 occurrences.\n\nFor the digit 8 in the tens place: Pages 480-488 have the tens digit as 8. That's 9 pages (480-488 inclusive). Wait, 480 to 488 is 9 pages because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. When considering the tens digit, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages, and the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages.\n\nSo, total tens digit 4's: 40 (from the first 400 pages) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50.\n\nTotal tens digit 8's: 40 (from the first 400 pages) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times. So, the difference here is 50 - 49 = 1.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is a bit different because it changes less frequently. For pages 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so we can ignore those. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. How many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nThe digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Therefore, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\nTotal 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89.\n\nNow, let's sum up the differences from each place:\n\n- Units place: 49 - 49 = 0\n- Tens place: 50 - 49 = 1\n- Hundreds place: 89 - 0 = 89\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n- Each 10 pages have one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n- 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 and one 8.\n- 48 * 1 = 48 for both 4 and 8.\n- Remaining pages: 488 - (48*10) = 488 - 480 = 8 pages: 481-488.\n- In these 8 pages, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n- So, units place total: 48 + 1 = 49 for both, so difference is 0. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each 100 pages have 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place (0-9).\n- So, 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 complete sets, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n- 4 * 10 = 40 for both 4 and 8 in the first 400 pages.\n- Remaining pages: 401-488, which is 88 pages.\n- In the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488).\n- For 4's in the tens place: 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 occurrences.\n- For 8's in the tens place: 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 occurrences.\n- So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n- Total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n- Difference: 50 - 49 = 1. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- Pages 1-99: no hundreds digit.\n- Pages 100-399: hundreds digits are 1, 2, 3.\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4.\n- So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages with hundreds digit 4.\n- Pages with hundreds digit 8: none, since the book ends at 488.\n- So, 4's: 89, 8's: 0.\n- Difference: 89 - 0 = 89. Correct.\n\nAdding up the differences: 0 (units) + 1 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I considered all page numbers correctly, especially in the tens place. When I considered the remaining 88 pages (401-488), I correctly accounted for the tens digits, right? For 4's in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 occurrences. For 8's, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages because 488 is included, so 9 occurrences. That seems right.\n\nAnother thing to check: when I calculated the hundreds digit, I considered that from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 pages. That's correct because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the units place. Let me recount. For units place, each 10 pages have one 4 and one 8. 488 pages mean 48 full sets of 10, which is 480 pages, and then 8 extra pages (481-488). In those 8 pages, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units 4's: 48 + 1 = 49, same for 8's. So, difference is 0. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up the differences: 0 (units) + 1 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is the hundreds place correct? Because from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's. But in the tens place, we had 50 4's and 49 8's, so a difference of 1. Units place is equal. So, total difference is 89 + 1 = 90. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nI don't think I missed anything. So, the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to 8's. We analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each 10 pages contribute one 4 and one 8.\n- 488 pages = 48 sets of 10, contributing 48 each.\n- Remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n- Total 4's: 49, 8's: 49. Difference: 0.\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each 100 pages contribute 10 4's and 10 8's.\n- 488 pages = 4 sets of 100, contributing 40 each.\n- Remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n  - 440-449 adds 10 4's.\n  - 480-488 adds 9 8's.\n- Total 4's: 50, 8's: 49. Difference: 1.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- Pages 400-488 have 4 as the hundreds digit for 89 pages.\n- No 8's in the hundreds place.\n- Total 4's: 89, 8's: 0. Difference: 89.\n\n**Total Difference:**\n- Units: 0\n- Tens: 1\n- Hundreds: 89\n- Sum: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nThus, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Each page number is a number from 1 to 488, and I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nAlright, let's start by considering the structure of page numbers. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since 488 is a three-digit number, I'll need to check all three places: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nI think the best approach is to analyze each digit place separately. That is, count how many 4's and 8's appear in the units place, then the tens place, and finally the hundreds place across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears once. But I need to see how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages.\n\nWait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of ten and then an extra 8 pages (481 to 488). So, in the units place, for each of the 48 complete sets, we have one 4 and one 8. That's 48 times each. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, we have a 4 in 484 and an 8 in 488. So that's one more 4 and one more 8 in the units place.\n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 48 (from complete sets) + 1 (from 484) = 49.\nTotal 8's in units place: 48 (from complete sets) + 1 (from 488) = 49.\n\nHmm, so in the units place, 4's and 8's are equal, both 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes through 0-9 ten times each. Wait, no, actually, for each ten numbers, the tens digit is the same. So, for the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in every 100 numbers.\n\nSo, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see. From 1 to 488, how many hundreds are there? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, we can think of it as 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, in the last partial hundred, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490, but we only go up to 488). Wait, let me correct that. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-490), but since we stop at 488, the tens digit 8 only appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers, but wait, no, the tens digit is 8 for the entire 480-489 range, but we only go up to 488. So, from 480-489, the tens digit is 8, but we only have 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but 480 is included in the 400s, right? So, in the 400s, 480-488 is part of the 400-499 range, but since we're only going up to 488, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, how many times does 8 appear in the last partial hundred? It's 9 times. Wait, but let me check: from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for the tens digit 4, in the 400s, when does it appear? It appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, in the 400s, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and the tens digit 8 appears 9 times (from 480-488).\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 4 * 10 (from each complete hundred) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50.\nTotal 8's in tens place: 4 * 10 (from each complete hundred) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49.\n\nWait, let me make sure. For each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4 hundreds give 40 times. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, so total 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's. For 8's, in each complete hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the last partial hundred, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times (since 488 is the last page). So, total 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers from 100 onwards. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so we can ignore those. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all pages from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers.\n\nThe digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\nTotal 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's.\n\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place: 48 complete sets of ten, each contributing one 4 and one 8. So 48 each. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 +1=49 for 4's, same for 8's.\n\nTens place: Each complete hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place. So 4 hundreds would give 40 each. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, so 40 +10=50 for 4's. For 8's, in the last partial hundred, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times, so 40 +9=49 for 8's.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 never appears.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 +50 +89= 188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting, we find that there are 90 more 4's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488.\n\nI think the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll go through each position and calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in each.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor the units digit, every 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10, and then 8 more numbers (481 to 488). \n\nIn each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for 8. So, for 48 complete groups, that's 48 times each for both 4 and 8 in the units place.\n\nNow, looking at the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits are 1 through 8. So, in these, the digit 8 appears once (488), and the digit 4 doesn't appear in the units place because the numbers go up to 8, skipping 4. So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nWait, that's a mistake. Let me correct that. From 481 to 488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, the digit 4 appears once in 484, and 8 appears once in 488. So, for the units place, 4 appears 48 (from the complete groups) + 1 (from 484) = 49 times. Similarly, 8 appears 48 (from the complete groups) + 1 (from 488) = 49 times. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. Hmm, okay, so the count for units is equal.\n\nNext, let's move to the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more numbers (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, looking at the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. Let's break this down:\n\n- From 401-409: tens digit is 0, so no 4 or 8 here.\n- 410-419: tens digit is 1, so no 4 or 8.\n- 420-429: tens digit is 2, so no 4 or 8.\n- 430-439: tens digit is 3, so no 4 or 8.\n- 440-449: tens digit is 4, so here 4 appears 10 times.\n- 450-459: tens digit is 5, so no 4 or 8.\n- 460-469: tens digit is 6, so no 4 or 8.\n- 470-479: tens digit is 7, so no 4 or 8.\n- 480-488: tens digit is 8, so here 8 appears 9 times (since 480-488 is 9 numbers).\n\nWait, let me check that. From 440-449, the tens digit is 4, so that's 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place, so 10 times.\n\nFrom 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but since the numbers go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here.\n\nSo, in the tens place, for the remaining 88 numbers, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nAdding that to the previous 40 times each from the complete hundreds, the total for the tens place would be:\n\n- 4: 40 + 10 = 50 times\n- 8: 40 + 9 = 49 times\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, each digit from 1 to 4 appears 100 times each, except that the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4 only up to 488, not the full 100 numbers.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\n- Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so no 4 or 8 here.\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so no 4 or 8.\n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, so no 4 or 8.\n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, so no 4 or 8.\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so here, 4 appears in the hundreds place for each of these 89 pages (from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers).\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book doesn't go beyond 488, so the hundreds digit only goes up to 4.\n\nSo, for the hundreds place:\n\n- 4: 89 times\n- 8: 0 times\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in all three places.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal for 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times\n\nFor the digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal for 8: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's.\n\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, in the units place, I thought 4 appears 49 times and 8 appears 49 times. Then, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. In the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times and 8 appears 0 times. So, adding up:\n\n4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n8: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI think I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Maybe I can calculate how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and do the same for 8, then find the difference. Let's start with the units place.\n\nFor the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So in every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once. So how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). \n\nIn each complete block, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So for 48 blocks, that's 48 times each. Now, the partial block from 481 to 488: the units digits here are 1 through 8. So 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8. So so far, both have 49 occurrences in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers, with each digit appearing 10 times in a block of 100. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 times, and 8 in 80-89, also 10 times. \n\nSo how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds and a partial hundred of 88 pages. \n\nIn each complete hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times. So for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 for each. Now, the partial hundred from 401 to 488. Let's see: the tens digit here is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, ..., up to 8 for 481-490. But since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, but since we're considering the tens digit, it's 10 times? Wait, no, from 481 to 490, the tens digit is 8, but we only go up to 488, so it's 8 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times? Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only have up to 488, it's 480-488, but wait, 480 isn't included because the book starts at 1. Wait, no, 480 is included because the pages go up to 488. Wait, let me clarify.\n\nWait, the partial hundred is from 401 to 488. So the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So for the tens digit 4: it's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, for the tens digit 8: it's from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? Wait, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. Wait, no, 480 is included, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 times. Wait, but 480 is page 480, which is included, so that's 9 numbers. Hmm, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the digit 8 in the tens place appears 9 times here. But wait, earlier, in the hundreds place, we had 400-499, but the book only goes up to 488, so the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 times. So for the tens place, in the partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). \n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that. So in the hundreds place, we have 400-488. So for the tens digit, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times because 480-488 is 9 numbers (including 480). So total for the tens place: 4 appears 4*10 + 10 = 50 times, and 8 appears 4*10 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, in the complete hundreds, each hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place, so 4 hundreds would be 4*10=40 for 4 and 4*10=40 for 8. Then in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So total for tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So yes, 9 times. So total for tens place: 50 for 4, 49 for 8.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (400-488 inclusive). So the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is either 1, 2, 3, or 4. 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total occurrences:\n\nFor 4:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, but wait, let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 numbers. So 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nSo the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens and 8 extra numbers. In each full ten, 4 appears once, so 48 times. In the last partial ten (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So total units for 4: 48 + 1 = 49, and for 8: 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nTens place: As calculated earlier, 50 for 4 and 49 for 8.\n\nHundreds place: 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's every 100 numbers, 10 times each. So 4 hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40. Then in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total 40 + 10 = 50. That's correct.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40. Then in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So total 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nSo the difference is indeed 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, and hundreds) separately:\n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total units place occurrences:\n     - '4' appears 49 times.\n     - '8' appears 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - Total tens place occurrences:\n     - '4' appears 50 times.\n     - '8' appears 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - Only page numbers 400-488 have '4' in the hundreds place.\n   - Total hundreds place occurrences:\n     - '4' appears 89 times.\n     - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place.\n\nSumming these:\n- Total '4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- Total '8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nThe difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number, right? So, pages 1 through 9 are single-digit, 10 through 99 are two-digit, and 100 through 488 are three-digit numbers. I guess I'll need to check each of these ranges separately to count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers, from 1 to 9. In this range, the numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So, I can see that the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 also appears once. So, in the single-digit pages, there's no difference between the number of 4's and 8's; they're both 1.\n\nNext, moving on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I think I should consider each place separately to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 for numbers from 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Now, how about the units place? In the units place, 4 appears once every ten numbers, so from 10 to 99, that's 9 sets of ten (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99). So, 4 appears in the units place 9 times (4,14,24,...,84,94). Wait, but wait, from 10 to 99, that's 90 numbers, so 9 times 4 in the units place. So total 4's in two-digit numbers would be 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8, let's do the same. In the tens place, 8 appears from 80 to 89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. In the units place, 8 appears once every ten numbers, so from 10 to 99, that's 9 times (8,18,28,...,88,98). So, 9 times. So total 8's in two-digit numbers would be 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nWait, but hold on, when I count from 10 to 99, the units digits go from 0 to 9 for each ten. So, for 4's in the units place, it's 10,20,...90, each having a 4 in the units place once. So that's 9 times, right? Because from 10 to 99, there are 9 sets of ten, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 9 times. Similarly, for 8's, it's 9 times as well. So, in two-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear 19 times each.\n\nWait, but wait, when I count from 10 to 99, the first ten is 10-19, then 20-29, up to 90-99. So that's 9 tens, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 9 each. So, 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19 for each digit.\n\nSo, in two-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear 19 times each. So, so far, in single and two-digit numbers, 4's and 8's are each appearing 1 (single-digit) + 19 (two-digit) = 20 times each. So, no difference yet.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complicated because there are three places: hundreds, tens, and units. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nLet me start with the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, but when it's 4, the tens and units digits are limited because 488 is the last page. So, I think I should handle the hundreds digit 4 separately.\n\nFirst, for hundreds digits 1, 2, and 3: Each of these will have 100 numbers (e.g., 100-199, 200-299, 300-399). So, for each of these, the hundreds digit is fixed, and the tens and units digits vary from 0-9. So, for each of these, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens and units places?\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to count each digit place separately, considering all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488.\n\nSo, let me break it down by each digit place: hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place:\n\n- For hundreds digit 1: Numbers from 100 to 199. The hundreds digit is 1, so 4 and 8 don't appear here. So, 0 times for both 4 and 8 in the hundreds place for this range.\n\n- Similarly, for hundreds digit 2: 200-299. Again, 4 and 8 don't appear in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\n- For hundreds digit 3: 300-399. Same thing, hundreds digit is 3, so 4 and 8 don't appear here. 0 times.\n\n- For hundreds digit 4: 400-488. Here, the hundreds digit is 4, so every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, for 8's in the hundreds place: Since the hundreds digit is 4 in this range, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place anywhere in the three-digit numbers. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place in three-digit numbers.\n\nWe need to consider all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488. Let's break it down by hundreds:\n\n1. Hundreds digit 1: 100-199. The tens digit can be 0-9, and units digit 0-9. So, for each tens digit, how many times does 4 and 8 appear?\n\n- For 4 in the tens place: The tens digit is 4, so numbers are 140-149. There are 10 numbers here, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\n- For 8 in the tens place: Similarly, 180-189, which is 10 numbers, so 8 appears 10 times.\n\n2. Hundreds digit 2: 200-299. Same logic applies.\n\n- 4 in tens place: 240-249, 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\n- 8 in tens place: 280-289, 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\n3. Hundreds digit 3: 300-399.\n\n- 4 in tens place: 340-349, 10 numbers.\n\n- 8 in tens place: 380-389, 10 numbers.\n\n4. Hundreds digit 4: 400-488.\n\nHere, the tens digit can go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the maximum). Let's check for 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n\n- For 4 in the tens place: Numbers from 440-449. But wait, the maximum is 488, so 440-449 is within that. So, 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times.\n\n- For 8 in the tens place: Numbers from 480-488. Wait, the tens digit is 8, so numbers would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, yes, 9 times.\n\nSo, adding up the tens place counts:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Hundreds 1: 10\n- Hundreds 2: 10\n- Hundreds 3: 10\n- Hundreds 4: 10 (since 440-449 is within 400-488)\nTotal: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 times.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Hundreds 1: 10\n- Hundreds 2: 10\n- Hundreds 3: 10\n- Hundreds 4: 9\nTotal: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers.\n\nAgain, let's break it down by hundreds digit.\n\n1. Hundreds digit 1: 100-199.\n\n- For each tens digit (0-9), the units digit can be 0-9. So, for each tens group (e.g., 100-109, 110-119, etc.), 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place per ten numbers. There are 10 tens groups, so for each digit:\n\n- 4 appears 10 times in the units place.\n\n- 8 appears 10 times in the units place.\n\n2. Hundreds digit 2: 200-299. Same as above.\n\n- 4 appears 10 times.\n\n- 8 appears 10 times.\n\n3. Hundreds digit 3: 300-399.\n\n- 4 appears 10 times.\n\n- 8 appears 10 times.\n\n4. Hundreds digit 4: 400-488.\n\nHere, the units digit can be 0-9, but we have to consider up to 488. So, let's see:\n\n- For 4 in the units place: In each tens group, 4 appears once. The tens digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, there's a number ending with 4. So, that's 9 times (404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484). Wait, but 484 is within 488, so yes, 9 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the units place: In each tens group, 8 appears once. So, from 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, so 9 tens groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 times.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so yes, 9 times.\n\nSo, in the units place for hundreds digit 4:\n\n- 4 appears 9 times.\n\n- 8 appears 9 times.\n\nNow, adding up the units place counts:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Hundreds 1: 10\n- Hundreds 2: 10\n- Hundreds 3: 10\n- Hundreds 4: 9\nTotal: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Hundreds 1: 10\n- Hundreds 2: 10\n- Hundreds 3: 10\n- Hundreds 4: 9\nTotal: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. For hundreds digit 4, units place: 4 appears 9 times, 8 appears 9 times. So, adding to the previous counts.\n\nWait, but in hundreds 1, 2, 3, each contributes 10 times for both 4 and 8 in the units place, so that's 30 each, and then hundreds 4 adds 9 each, making total 39 each. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let me summarize the counts for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\n- Tens place: 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\n- Units place: 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\nSo, total for three-digit numbers:\n\n4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168 times.\n\n8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78 times.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. I thought for 4's in the tens place, it was 10 (hundreds 1) + 10 (hundreds 2) + 10 (hundreds 3) + 10 (hundreds 4) = 40. But in hundreds 4, the tens place for 4 was 10 numbers (440-449), which is correct. So, 40 for 4's in tens place.\n\nFor 8's in tens place: 10 (hundreds 1) + 10 (hundreds 2) + 10 (hundreds 3) + 9 (hundreds 4) = 39, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for units place, 4's: 10 (hundreds 1) + 10 (hundreds 2) + 10 (hundreds 3) + 9 (hundreds 4) = 39.\n\nSame for 8's in units place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\n8's in three-digit numbers: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nNow, let's add up all the digits across single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nFirst, single-digit:\n\n4's: 1\n\n8's: 1\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n4's: 19\n\n8's: 19\n\nThree-digit:\n\n4's: 168\n\n8's: 78\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, in three-digit numbers, 4's in hundreds place: 89, which seems correct because from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each starting with 4.\n\nTens place: 40 for 4's, 39 for 8's.\n\nUnits place: 39 for both.\n\nSo, 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\n8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nAdding single and two-digit:\n\n4's: 1 + 19 = 20\n\n8's: 1 + 19 = 20\n\nTotal 4's: 20 + 168 = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 20 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Each page number is a three-digit number, right? Wait, no, actually, page numbers start from 1, so they go from 1 to 488. So, page numbers can be one, two, or three digits long. But for the sake of counting digits, maybe I should consider all page numbers as three-digit numbers by padding with leading zeros. So, page 1 would be 001, page 10 would be 010, and so on. That might make it easier to count each digit place separately.\n\nAlright, so I can think of each page number as a three-digit number: the hundreds place, the tens place, and the ones place. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and how many times the digit 8 appears in each place. Then, I can sum them up for each digit and find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place one by one.\n\nFirst, the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in a complete set of numbers. Since the book has 488 pages, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488? Let me calculate 488 divided by 10, which is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers.\n\nIn each complete set of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears once. So, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 times 1, which is 48, plus any additional 4's in the remaining 8 numbers. The remaining numbers after 480 are 481 to 488. The units digits here are 1 through 8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the number of 8's is also 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, the count of 4's and 8's is the same.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 extra numbers (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for the tens place, the number of 4's is 4 times 10 = 40, and the same for 8's, which is also 40.\n\nNow, let's check the remaining 88 numbers (401-488). The tens digit in this range goes from 0 (for 401-409) up to 8 (for 480-488). Let's count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nFrom 401 to 409, the tens digit is 0, so no 4 or 8 there. From 410 to 419, the tens digit is 1; again, no 4 or 8. Similarly, 420-429: tens digit 2; no. 430-439: tens digit 3; no. 440-449: tens digit 4. So, from 440-449, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 more 4's. Then, 450-459: tens digit 5; no. 460-469: tens digit 6; no. 470-479: tens digit 7; no. 480-488: tens digit 8, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, that's 9 more 8's.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, right? So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers, so 9 more 8's.\n\nSo, in the tens place, the total number of 4's is 40 (from the complete hundreds) plus 10 (from 440-449) = 50. The number of 8's is 40 (from the complete hundreds) plus 9 (from 480-488) = 49. So, in the tens place, there are 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. Pages 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit, so we can consider the hundreds digit as 0 for those. Pages 100-199 have a hundreds digit of 1, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. Let's find out how many numbers that is. 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, meaning the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit cycles through 0,1,2,3,4, etc. Since 488 is less than 800, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place at all. Therefore, the count of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = Let me calculate that. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me double-check.\n\nWait, in the units place, both 4 and 8 had 49 each. In the tens place, 4 had 50 and 8 had 49. In the hundreds place, 4 had 89 and 8 had 0. So, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nTotal pages: 488.\n\nEach 10 pages, digits 0-9 appear once in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 and one 8. So, 48 each.\n\nThen, the remaining 8 pages: 481-488. The units digits are 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) contribute 4*10=40 for each digit.\n\nThen, the remaining 88 pages (401-488). Let's break it down:\n\n401-409: tens digit 0\n410-419: tens digit 1\n420-429: tens digit 2\n430-439: tens digit 3\n440-449: tens digit 4 (10 numbers)\n450-459: tens digit 5\n460-469: tens digit 6\n470-479: tens digit 7\n480-488: tens digit 8 (9 numbers)\n\nSo, 4's in tens place: 10\n8's in tens place: 9\n\nTherefore, total tens place:\n\n4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so no 4 or 8.\n100-199: hundreds digit 1\n200-299: hundreds digit 2\n300-399: hundreds digit 3\n400-488: hundreds digit 4 (89 numbers)\n800-899: hundreds digit 8, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no pages with hundreds digit 8.\n\nSo, hundreds digit 4: 89 times\nHundreds digit 8: 0 times\n\nTotal 4's: 89\nTotal 8's: 0\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99 + 89 = 188\n8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Did I count correctly in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nAnd for the 8's, since the book doesn't reach 800, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: the hundreds digit for 4 is 89, which is a significant contribution to the count of 4's. The 8's don't have any hundreds digit, so their count is entirely dependent on the lower two digits.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, 8's had 49, which is 40 from the complete hundreds and 9 from the last partial hundred. So, that seems correct.\n\nLet me check the units place again. 488 pages, so units digits cycle 48 times with 10 each, giving 48 4's and 48 8's. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So, units total: 49 each. Correct.\n\nTens place: 4's had 50 and 8's had 49. So, the difference in the tens place is 1. But the hundreds place gives 4's an additional 89, so overall, the difference is 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 '4's and 48 '8's.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add 1 '4' (484) and 1 '8' (488).\n   - Total '4's: 49, '8's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times per hundred.\n   - 4 complete hundreds contribute 40 '4's and 40 '8's.\n   - The remaining 88 pages (401-488) add 10 '4's (440-449) and 9 '8's (480-488).\n   - Total '4's: 50, '8's: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 1-99 have no hundreds digit.\n   - Pages 400-488 contribute 89 '4's.\n   - No '8's appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total '4's: 89, '8's: 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number is a three-digit number, right? Wait, actually, no. Page numbers start at 1 and go up to 488, so the first few pages are single-digit, then two-digit, then three-digit. So, I should probably consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nLet me start by thinking about how often each digit appears in each position. For the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once every 10 numbers. But wait, since we're starting at 1, the first page is 1, so maybe the units digits start at 1 and go up to 9, then 0 at page 10. So, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally, except that 0 appears one less time because page 10 is the first to have a 0 in the units place. Wait, no, actually, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 pages. So, how many complete cycles of 10 are there in 488 pages?\n\nLet me calculate that. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete cycles of 10 and then 8 more pages. So, in each complete cycle, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. So, the number of times each digit appears in the units place is 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits are 1 through 8. So, for the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times plus once in the 484th page, making it 49 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 48 times plus once in the 488th page, making it 49 times as well. Wait, no, 488 is the last page, so 488 has 8 in the units place, but 481 is 1, 482 is 2, up to 488 which is 8. So, in the units place, 8 appears once more, so total 48 +1=49 times. Similarly, 4 appears once in 484, so 49 times. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 1 to 480, each digit 0-9 appears exactly 48 times in the units place because 480 is 48*10. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so each digit 1-8 appears once more. So, 4 appears once more in 484, and 8 appears once more in 488. So, total for units place: 48 +1=49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit changes every 10 pages. So, for example, from 1-9, the tens digit is 0. From 10-19, it's 1, 20-29 it's 2, and so on up to 480-488, where the tens digit is 8. So, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place?\n\nEach tens digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in a block of 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, each tens digit 0-9 appears 10 times each in the tens place. But since we're only going up to 488, we need to adjust for that.\n\nFirst, let's consider how many complete hundreds there are in 488. There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 pages in the 400s (401-488). So, for each complete hundred, each tens digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 complete hundreds mean 4*10=40 times each for digits 0-9 in the tens place.\n\nNow, in the incomplete hundred from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times, except that 8 only appears 9 times because 480-488 is 9 pages (480,481,...488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 pages: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, the tens digit is 8 for all these pages, so digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in this last partial hundred.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 401-410, the tens digit is 0 (since 401 is 4 0 1, 410 is 4 1 0). Wait, no, 401 is 4 0 1, so the tens digit is 0. Then 410 is 4 1 0, so the tens digit is 1. So, from 401-410, the tens digits go from 0 to 1, but that's only 10 numbers, so each tens digit from 0 to 1 appears once? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 401-410 is 10 numbers, where the tens digit is 0 for 401-409 (9 numbers) and 1 for 410. So, in the 400s, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times, except for the last one, which is 8, which appears 9 times because we stop at 488.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it differently. For each hundred, like 1-100, the tens digits cycle through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each complete hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. Since we have 4 complete hundreds (1-400), that's 4*10=40 times each for digits 0-9 in the tens place.\n\nNow, in the 401-488 range, which is 88 pages, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times, except for 8, which appears 9 times because we only go up to 488. So, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 0 appears 10 times (401-410), 1 appears 10 times (411-420), and so on up to 8, which appears 9 times (480-488). Therefore, in the 401-488 range, each digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times, except 8 which appears 9 times.\n\nSo, the total number of times each digit appears in the tens place is 40 (from the complete hundreds) plus the number of times it appears in the 401-488 range.\n\nSo, for digits 0-7: 40 +10=50 times each.\n\nFor digit 8: 40 +9=49 times.\n\nWait, but wait, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, yes, 40+9=49 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, digits 0-7 in the tens place appear 10 times each in the 401-488 range, so 40+10=50 times each.\n\nSo, for the tens place:\n\n- Digit 4 appears 50 times.\n\n- Digit 8 appears 49 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place?\n\nFrom 1-99, there's no hundreds digit, so those are 0 times. Then, from 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, appearing 100 times. From 200-299, it's 2, appearing 100 times. From 300-399, it's 3, appearing 100 times. From 400-488, it's 4, appearing 89 times (since 488-400+1=89 pages).\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- Digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\n- Digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because we only go up to 488, and the hundreds digit is 4.\n\nSo, for the hundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times.\n\n- 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each digit place.\n\nStarting with 4:\n\n- Units place: 49 times.\n\n- Tens place: 50 times.\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 times.\n\nTotal for 4: 49 +50 +89 = 188 times.\n\nNow for 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times.\n\n- Tens place: 49 times.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nTotal for 8: 49 +49 +0 = 98 times.\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\nFrom 1-488, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place, plus an extra 8 digits from 481-488, which adds 1 more for 4 and 1 more for 8. So, 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach complete hundred (1-100, etc.) contributes 10 times each digit 0-9 in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 40 each. Then, in the 401-488 range, each tens digit 0-8 appears 10 times except 8, which appears 9 times. So, 40 +10=50 for 4, and 40 +9=49 for 8. That adds up correctly.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly 4 appears 89 times, and 8 doesn't appear there. So, 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nAdding up: 49+50+89=188 for 4, and 49+49+0=98 for 8. The difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nSo, yes, the total for 4 is 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nFor 8, units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0, so 98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place from 1-480.\n   - Pages 481-488 add one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488).\n   - Total: 49 each for 4 and 8.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place from 1-400.\n   - Pages 401-488 add 10 more times for digits 0-7 and 9 times for 8.\n   - Total: 50 for 4, 49 for 8.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Only digit 4 appears 89 times (pages 400-488).\n   - No 8's in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number is a three-digit number, right? From 001 to 488, but actually, page 1 is just 1, not 001. Wait, no, in books, page numbers don't have leading zeros, so page 1 is 1, page 10 is 10, and so on. So, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this systematically. Maybe I can consider each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Since 488 is a three-digit number, the page numbers can be considered as three-digit numbers with leading zeros if necessary, but since page numbers don't actually have leading zeros, I need to adjust for that. Wait, no, perhaps it's better to just consider each position as it is, without padding with zeros. So, page numbers from 1 to 488 can be thought of as 1-digit, 2-digit, and 3-digit numbers.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to consider all page numbers as three-digit by padding with leading zeros, so page 1 becomes 001, page 10 becomes 010, and so on. That way, I can analyze each digit place separately without missing any. Let me try that approach.\n\nSo, if I consider each page number as a three-digit number, the digits are in the hundreds, tens, and units places. Now, I can calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each place separately.\n\nLet's start with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each block of 10 consecutive numbers. For example, from 1 to 10, the units digits go from 1 to 0 (if considering 10 as 0 in units place, but actually, 10 is 10, so units digit is 0). Wait, maybe I should adjust for the fact that we're starting from 1, not 0. Hmm, but perhaps padding with leading zeros will help, so 001 to 488 becomes 001 to 488, which is 488 numbers. So, from 000 to 487, but page 1 is 001, so maybe that's complicating it. Alternatively, maybe it's better to count from 1 to 488 without padding and see how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nLet me try without padding. So, page numbers from 1 to 488. Let's count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor the units digit, 4 and 8 each appear once every 10 numbers. For example, in 1-10, 4 appears once (at 4), and 8 appears once (at 8). So, in each block of 10, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 numbers (from 481 to 488). \n\nIn each complete block, we have one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 blocks, that's 48 4's and 48 8's in the units place.\n\nNow, in the partial block from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 481:1, 482:2, 483:3, 484:4, 485:5, 486:6, 487:7, 488:8. So, in this partial block, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). \n\nSo, total units place: 48 +1 = 49 4's and 48 +1 = 49 8's. Wait, but 488 is included, so 488 is page 488, which is the last page. So, yes, 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, units place total: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 1 to 480, that's 480 pages, which is 48 blocks of 10. So, 48 4's and 48 8's in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, which is 8 pages, as above, we have one 4 and one 8. So, total units place: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in each block of 100. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 numbers, and 8 for 80-89, which is another 10 numbers.\n\nSo, in each block of 100, there are 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488? Well, 400 pages would be 4 blocks of 100 each. Then, from 401 to 488, that's 88 pages, which is less than another full block.\n\nSo, in the first 400 pages, there are 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4*10 = 40 4's and 40 8's.\n\nNow, from 401 to 488, which is 88 pages, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nFrom 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 for each hundred. Wait, but 401-499 would be the next block, but we're only going up to 488.\n\nSo, in 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 480-488). So, let's see:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nSo, in this range, the tens digit is 4 for 441-450, which is 10 numbers, and 8 for 481-488, which is 8 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 481-488 is 8 numbers, right? From 481 to 488 inclusive, that's 8 pages.\n\nSo, in the tens place, from 401-488:\n\n- 4 appears 10 times (441-450)\n- 8 appears 8 times (481-488)\n\nSo, total in the tens place:\n\n4's: 40 (from 1-400) +10 (from 401-488) = 50\n\n8's: 40 (from 1-400) +8 (from 401-488) = 48\n\nWait, but wait, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, total tens place: 50 4's and 48 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (from 400 to 488 inclusive). Wait, 488 - 400 +1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, meaning 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\n8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, hundreds place:\n\n4's: 89\n\n8's: 0\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate: 49+50=99, 99+89=188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 97 (number of 8's) equals 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8, so 48 each. Then, the partial block from 481-488 contributes 1 4 and 1 8, so total 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's, so 40 each. Then, from 401-488, 4's in tens place: 10 (from 441-450), and 8's: 8 (from 481-488). So, total 50 4's and 48 8's. That adds up correctly.\n\nHundreds place: 4's appear from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's. 8's don't appear in hundreds place, so 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From page 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 pages, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAnother way to check: total number of digits printed is 488 pages, each page number is up to 3 digits, so total digits: 1-9: 9 pages, 1 digit each: 9 digits\n\n10-99: 90 pages, 2 digits each: 180 digits\n\n100-488: 389 pages, 3 digits each: 1167 digits\n\nTotal digits: 9 + 180 + 1167 = 1356 digits\n\nNow, total number of digits counted for 4's and 8's: 188 + 97 = 285. That seems plausible, but maybe not necessary for the problem.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the tens place for the 401-488 range. Let me recount.\n\nFrom 401-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's from 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times.\n\nAnd 8 appears in the tens place from 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nAnother check: in the units place, from 1-488, how many 4's? Well, every 10 pages, there's one 4 in the units place. So, 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full times, plus one more in the partial block (484). So, 49 4's. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: same logic, 49.\n\nIn the tens place, 4's: 40 from 1-400, plus 10 from 441-450, so 50. Correct.\n\n8's in tens place: 40 from 1-400, plus 8 from 481-488, so 48. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4's: 89, 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 +50 +89 = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 49 +48 +0 = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nSo, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in the units place? For example, page 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's included in the 49 8's.\n\nSimilarly, page 484 has a 4 in the units place, included in the 49 4's.\n\nWait, but when considering the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, the tens digit is 8 in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 8's. Correct.\n\nI think my calculations are accurate. So, the difference is 91.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number, right? So, pages 1-9 are single-digit, 10-99 are two-digit, and 100-488 are three-digit numbers. \n\nI think I should handle each digit place separately because the occurrence of digits varies depending on the place. That is, I'll look at the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place separately for both 4's and 8's. \n\nStarting with the units place. For each set of ten numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. Now, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). \n\nSo, for the units place, each digit (4 and 8) appears 48 times in each complete set. But wait, in the incomplete set from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 4 appear in the units place here? Yes, at 484. And does 8 appear? Yes, at 488. So, that's one more 4 and one more 8 in the units place. \n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 48 (from complete sets) + 1 (from incomplete set) = 49. Similarly, 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, 4's and 8's are equal. \n\nMoving on to the tens place. For the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears in a block of ten numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. Wait, actually, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times, but each digit appears 10 times in each hundred. So, for the tens place, each digit appears 10 times per hundred. \n\nNow, let's see how many hundreds we have. The book goes up to 488, so we have four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, actually, 488 is in the 400s, so the hundreds are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. \n\nSo, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, for the tens place, each digit (including 4 and 8) appears 10 times per hundred. \n\nNow, how many complete hundreds are there? Up to 400, which is four hundreds. So, in each of these four hundreds, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 x 10 = 40 for 4's and 4 x 10 = 40 for 8's in the tens place. \n\nBut wait, we have pages from 401-488. So, in the 400s, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So, the tens digit in 401-488 goes from 0 to 8, but only up to 488. So, does that affect the count for the tens place? \n\nLet me think. From 401-488, the tens digit cycles 0-8, but each digit appears 10 times except for 8, which appears only 8 times (from 481-488). Wait, no, actually, the tens digit for 401-410 is 0, 411-420 is 1, ..., 481-490 is 8, but since we stop at 488, the tens digit 8 only goes up to 488, which is 8 numbers (481-488), not 10. So, for the tens place in 401-488, the digit 8 appears only 8 times, not 10. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought that each hundred has 10 occurrences per digit in the tens place. But in the last partial hundred (401-488), the digit 8 in the tens place appears fewer times. So, I need to adjust for that. \n\nSo, for the tens place:\n\n- Hundreds 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400: each has 10 occurrences of 4 and 8 in the tens place. So, 4 x 10 = 40 for 4's and 40 for 8's.\n\n- Now, 401-488: the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. For each digit 0-7, they each appear 10 times (401-410, 411-420, ..., 471-480). But for digit 8, it's only from 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 occurrences. \n\nSo, in 401-488:\n\n- For 4's in the tens place: when does the tens digit equal 4? That's 441-450. Wait, no, 441-450 is part of 401-500, but since we're only going up to 488, 441-450 is entirely within 401-488. So, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times here (441-450). So, that's 10 occurrences.\n\n- For 8's in the tens place: as I said earlier, it's only 8 occurrences (481-488). \n\nSo, in the 401-488 range, 4's in the tens place: 10, and 8's: 8.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in tens place: 40 (from first four hundreds) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 (from first four hundreds) + 8 (from 401-488) = 48.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 48 times. So, 4's have 2 more in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, for the hundreds place:\n\n- Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so no contribution.\n\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1. So, 4 and 8 don't appear here.\n\n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2. Again, no 4's or 8's.\n\n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3. Still no 4's or 8's.\n\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4. So, every page from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\n- For 8's in the hundreds place: since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\nTotal 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's have 89 more occurrences than 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences across all digit places.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n\n- Tens place: 50\n\n- Hundreds place: 89\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n\n- Tens place: 48\n\n- Hundreds place: 0\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, earlier in the units place, I thought each digit appears 48 times in complete sets, plus in the incomplete set, 481-488, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 +1=49 for both, correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For 4's: first four hundreds (1-400) give 4 x 10 =40. Then in 401-488, 441-450 is 10 more, so total 50. Correct.\n\n- For 8's: first four hundreds give 4 x10=40. In 401-488, 481-488 is 8 more, so 40+8=48. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4's appear 89 times (400-488), 8's 0 times.\n\nSo, 4's total: 49+50+89=188.\n\n8's total: 49+48+0=97.\n\nDifference: 188-97=91.\n\nWait, but I'm thinking, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me recount.\n\nFrom 400-488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1 =89 pages. So, each of these pages has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in hundreds place. Correct.\n\nFor 8's in hundreds place, since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 800s, so 0. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 91.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. In the 401-488 range, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences. And the tens digit 8 occurs in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 occurrences. So, that part is correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, each complete set of ten gives one 4 and one 8, and the incomplete set (481-488) gives one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So, units place counts are correct.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units)+48 (tens)+0 (hundreds)=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 91 seems a large difference. Let me see if I can think of another way to calculate this.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the total number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract.\n\nTotal number of 4's:\n\n- Units place: As before, each ten has one 4, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in 481-488, 484 is the only 4 in units place. So, 48+1=49.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is another 10. So, total 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nSimilarly, total number of 8's:\n\n- Units place: Each ten has one 8, so 48 full tens, 48. Then, in 481-488, 488 is the only 8 in units place. So, 48+1=49.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, 40+8=48.\n\n- Hundreds place: No 8's, as before.\n\nTotal 8's:49+48=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Each page number is a three-digit number, right? Wait, no, actually, page numbers can be one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit numbers depending on the page. So, for example, pages 1 to 9 are single-digit, 10 to 99 are two-digit, and 100 to 488 are three-digit numbers. \n\nI think the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4. \n\nFirst, I'll consider the units place. For every set of ten consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, how many such sets are there up to page 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of ten and then 8 extra numbers. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times. But wait, in the last partial set (481-488), does the digit 4 appear in the units place? Yes, 484 is within that range, so that's one more. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for every block of 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see, 400-488 is one block, and then 40-49 is another. Wait, actually, from 1-488, the blocks where the tens digit is 4 are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Hmm, wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is actually within 488, so that's correct. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so yes, 50 in total.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding all these up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's printed are 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, for every set of ten numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, up to page 488, there are 48 full sets of ten and then 8 extra numbers. So, 48 times in the units place. In the last partial set, 481-488, does 8 appear in the units place? Yes, 488 is the last page, so that's one more. So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for every block of 100 numbers. Specifically, from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. So, let's count how many blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 occurrences except the last one, which contributes 9 (since 488 is the last page). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? So, 480-488: 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences. So, total tens place 8's: (4 blocks \u00d7 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. The first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 numbers, so that's 4\u00d710=40. The fifth block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more. So, total 49 in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never is 8. So, zero occurrences in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, when I counted the tens place, I thought of five blocks, but actually, the first four blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10, so that's 40. Then, 480-488 is the next block, contributing 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49, which is correct. So, total 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units were 49 and tens were 49, so total 98. So, 4's are 188, 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counting, because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nUnits place: For every 10 pages, 4 appears once. From 1 to 488, how many times? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last partial ten (481-488), 484 has a 4 in units place, so +1, total 49.\n\nTens place: 4 appears in the tens place in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d710 = 50.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 +89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last partial ten (481-488), 488 has an 8 in units place, so +1, total 49.\n\nTens place: 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks are 10 each, so 4\u00d710=40. The last block, 480-488, is 9 numbers, so 9. Total 49.\n\nHundreds place: 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 +49=98.\n\nSo, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I missed anything. For example, in the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers. Let me calculate 488 -400 +1=89, which is correct.\n\nFor the tens place, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct.\n\nFor the 8's, in the tens place, 480-488 is correct, contributing 9.\n\nI think that's all correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 pages. With 48 full sets (480 pages) and one extra page (484), totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 pages, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Each page number is a three-digit number, right? Well, actually, it's either one, two, or three digits depending on the page. But since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the first few pages are single-digit, then two-digit, and then three-digit numbers.\n\nI think the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears, then subtract the two to find the difference. That makes sense. So, I need to calculate the total number of 4's and 8's separately and then find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That way, I can systematically count the occurrences without missing any.\n\nFirst, let's consider the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, in 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. Similarly, in 11-20, it's 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0, and so on.\n\nNow, since the book has 488 pages, the last page is 488. So, the units digit cycles every 10 pages. To find out how many times each digit appears in the units place, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives me 48 full groups of 10 pages and a remainder of 8 pages. So, in each digit place, the digit 4 will appear 48 times for the full groups and then check the remaining 8 pages to see if the 4 appears again.\n\nWait, actually, let me think again. For each digit place, the number of times a specific digit appears can be calculated by considering how many complete cycles there are and then adding any extra occurrences in the incomplete cycle.\n\nSo, for the units place, each digit from 0-9 appears equally in each cycle of 10. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete cycles times 1 (since each cycle has one 4) plus any additional 4's in the remaining pages.\n\nSimilarly for 8's. So, let's calculate the number of complete cycles in 488 pages.\n\n488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete cycles of 10 pages each, and then 8 more pages.\n\nTherefore, in the units place:\n\nNumber of 4's = 48 (from complete cycles) + 1 if the remainder includes a 4. Wait, in the units place, the remainder pages would be 481 to 488. So, the units digits in these pages would be 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, the digit 4 appears once in the units place in the remainder. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: 48 (from complete cycles) + 1 (since 8 appears once in the remainder). So, total 8's in units place: 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check that again. The remainder is 8 pages, so pages 481 to 488. The units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, yes, both have 49 occurrences in the units place.\n\nOkay, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages, right? Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), then 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), up to 9 (90-99). So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred.\n\nSimilarly, for 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, there are 4 complete hundreds and then 88 pages extra.\n\nSo, in the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 4*10=40 times. Now, we need to check the remaining 88 pages to see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nWait, actually, the remaining pages after 400 would be from 401 to 488, which is 88 pages. Let's break this down.\n\nFrom 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nWait, but 481-488 is only 8 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for all of them.\n\nSo, in the remaining 88 pages, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Looking at 441-450, which is 10 pages, so the tens digit is 4 for 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears in the tens place in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 times.\n\nTherefore, total number of 4's in the tens place:\n\nComplete hundreds: 4*10=40\nRemaining pages: 10\nTotal: 40 +10=50\n\nSimilarly, total number of 8's in the tens place:\n\nComplete hundreds: 4*10=40\nRemaining pages: 8\nTotal: 40 +8=48\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 4's in tens place: 50, 8's in tens place:48.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (488 - 400 +1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 times.\n\nHow about 8? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place:89\nTotal 8's in hundreds place:0\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:48\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 -97=91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n- 488 pages, so units digit cycles every 10. 488/10=48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing 1 to 4 and 1 to 8. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once. So, units place:48+1=49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- 488 pages, so 4 full hundreds (1-400) and 88 pages (401-488). For each hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 for each digit. Then, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, 4 appears in 441-450 (10 times) and 8 appears in 481-488 (8 times). So, total 4's in tens place:40+10=50, 8's:40+8=48. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only has 488 pages. So, 8's in hundreds place:0.\n\nAdding up:\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=97\nDifference:188-97=91\n\nHmm, that seems correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. Subtracting these gives 91 more 4's.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488.\n\nI think the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by considering the positions where digits can appear: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll handle each digit position separately for both 4 and 8.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, like 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Let me calculate how many such numbers there are. The last number ending with 4 before 488 is 484. So, starting from 4, each subsequent number is 10 apart. To find the total count, I can take 484 divided by 10, which is 48.4, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 484 is the 49th occurrence because we start counting from 4 as the first occurrence. Let me check: 4 is the 1st, 14 is the 2nd, ..., 484 is the 49th. So, actually, it's 49 times. Hmm, I think my initial approach was a bit off. Let me correct that. The formula for the number of times a digit appears in the units place is floor((n + 10 - d)/10), where d is the digit we're looking for. But maybe a simpler way is to consider that for every 10 numbers, the digit appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. Divided by 10, that's 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, which gives 48. But wait, 488 is not a multiple of 10, so we have an extra 8 pages beyond 480. So, the last group is 481 to 488. In this group, the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, adding that, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 (from the full groups) plus 1 (from the last partial group) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, let's look at the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for numbers from 40 to 49, 140 to 149, 240 to 249, 340 to 349, and 440 to 449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Okay, that seems right.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? The last number ending with 8 before 488 is 488 itself. So, starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's calculate the number of such numbers. The first is 8, and the last is 488. The difference between 488 and 8 is 480, which divided by 10 gives 48. So, that's 48 intervals, meaning 49 numbers (including both ends). Wait, no, because 488 is included, so the count is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers from 80 to 89, 180 to 189, 280 to 289, 380 to 389, and 480 to 488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last one, which is only 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, let's count:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers\n\nSo, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800 to 899. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up the 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. For 480-488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, yes, 49 in total.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check again.\n\nWait, when I counted the 4's in the hundreds place, I considered 400-488, which is 89 numbers. That's correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nFor the 8's, in the tens place, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times 8 appears in the tens place in that range. So, 49 in total for the tens place.\n\nWait, but when I calculated the 4's, I included 440-449 in the tens place, which is correct, and 400-488 in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, another way to check: perhaps I made a mistake in the 4's count. Let me recount.\n\nUnits place for 4's: from 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The sequence is 4 + 10*(n-1) \u2264 488. So, 4 +10(n-1) \u2264488 \u2192 10(n-1) \u2264484 \u2192 n-1 \u226448.4 \u2192 n \u226449.4, so n=49. So, 49 times.\n\nTens place for 4's: each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so from 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. How many blocks? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, except the last block, which only goes up to 488. Wait, no, the tens digit in 440-449 is 4, so that's a full 10 numbers. Then, after that, 450-488 doesn't affect the tens digit being 4. So, 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The last term is 488, which is 8 +10*(n-1)=488 \u2192 10*(n-1)=480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 times.\n\nTens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four ranges contributes 10 numbers, and the last contributes 9. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: none, as 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, 49 +49=98.\n\nThus, 188 -98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in the hundreds place for 4's? 400-488 is 89 numbers, yes, because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89.\n\nAnd for the 8's, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, correct.\n\nHmm, so the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a large number. Let me think of another way to count.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately using a formula.\n\nFor any digit d, the number of times it appears in each position can be calculated as follows:\n\n- For units place: floor(n/10) + (1 if the units digit is >=d else 0)\n- For tens place: floor(n/100)*10 + max(0, (n%100 - d*10 +1) if the tens digit is >=d else 0)\n- For hundreds place: similar logic.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to think in terms of each position.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use a more systematic approach.\n\nLet me consider each digit position separately for 4's and 8's.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n1. Units place:\n   - For each complete group of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - Number of complete groups: floor(488/10) = 48.\n   - So, 48 times from complete groups.\n   - Now, check the remaining numbers: 488 % 10 = 8, which is less than 10, so the last group is 481-488. In this group, 484 has a 4 in the units place, so that's 1 more.\n   - Total units place 4's: 48 +1=49.\n\n2. Tens place:\n   - For each complete group of 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49).\n   - Number of complete hundreds: floor(488/100)=4 (since 4*100=400).\n   - So, 4 complete groups, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40.\n   - Now, check the remaining 88 numbers (488-400+1=89, but wait, from 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, so the incomplete group is 400-488.\n   - In the tens place, how many times does 4 appear in 400-488?\n   - The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 in 400-488.\n   - So, 4 appears in the tens place for 440-449, which is 10 numbers.\n   - So, add 10.\n   - Total tens place 4's: 40 +10=50.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - So, 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89=188.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\n1. Units place:\n   - Each complete group of 10 contributes 1.\n   - Number of complete groups: floor(488/10)=48.\n   - So, 48 times.\n   - Remaining numbers: 488%10=8, so check if the last number (488) has an 8 in units place. Yes, it does. So, add 1.\n   - Total units place 8's:48 +1=49.\n\n2. Tens place:\n   - Each complete group of 100 contributes 10 times (e.g., 80-89).\n   - Number of complete hundreds: floor(488/100)=4.\n   - So, 4*10=40.\n   - Now, check the remaining 88 numbers (400-488).\n   - In the tens place, 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page).\n   - So, add 9.\n   - Total tens place 8's:40 +9=49.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\n   - 8 would appear in 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 0 times.\n\nTotal 8's:49 +49=98.\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. So, I think the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me just think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe by considering each digit position separately and using a formula.\n\nThe formula for the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to n is as follows:\n\nFor each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times d appears.\n\nFor units place:\n\ncount_units = (n // 10) + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nBut wait, that's not exactly correct. It's actually:\n\ncount_units = (n + 10 - d) // 10\n\nSimilarly, for tens place:\n\ncount_tens = (n // 100) * 10 + max(0, (n % 100 - d*10 +1))\n\nAnd for hundreds place:\n\ncount_hundreds = (n // 1000) * 100 + max(0, (n % 1000 - d*100 +1))\n\nBut perhaps I can apply this formula for both 4 and 8.\n\nLet me try for 4:\n\nUnits place:\n(488 + 10 -4) //10 = (494)//10=49.4 \u2192 floor to 49.\n\nTens place:\n(488 // 100) *10 + max(0, (488%100 -4*10 +1))=4*10 + max(0,88 -40 +1)=40 + max(0,49)=40 +49=89? Wait, that can't be right because earlier I calculated 50 for tens place.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misapplying the formula. Let me check.\n\nWait, the formula for tens place is:\n\ncount_tens = (n // 100) * 10 + max(0, (n % 100 - d*10 + 1))\n\nSo, for 4:\n\nn=488, d=4.\n\nn//100=4.\n\nmax(0, (488%100 -4*10 +1))=max(0,88 -40 +1)=max(0,49)=49.\n\nSo, count_tens=4*10 +49=40 +49=89.\n\nWait, but earlier I calculated 50 for tens place. There's a discrepancy here. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula counts the number of times 4 appears in the tens place from 0 to 488, but in reality, page numbers start at 1, so maybe I need to adjust.\n\nWait, no, the formula is for numbers from 0 to n, but page numbers start at 1, so maybe I need to subtract the count for 0 if necessary. But 0 isn't a page number, so maybe it's okay.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, the tens place count for 4 is 89, but earlier I thought it was 50. That's a big difference. I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, let's think again. The formula might be correct, but perhaps I'm misapplying it.\n\nWait, for the tens place, each time the tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 100 numbers. So, in 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nFrom 40-49:10 numbers.\n\nFrom 140-149:10.\n\nFrom 240-249:10.\n\nFrom 340-349:10.\n\nFrom 440-449:10.\n\nThat's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50.\n\nBut according to the formula, it's 89. That can't be right. So, perhaps the formula is not being applied correctly.\n\nWait, let me check the formula again. The formula for the number of times digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to n is:\n\ncount_tens = (n // 100) * 10 + max(0, (n % 100 - d*10 + 1))\n\nSo, for n=488, d=4:\n\ncount_tens = (488 // 100)*10 + max(0, (488%100 -4*10 +1))=4*10 + max(0,88 -40 +1)=40 + max(0,49)=40 +49=89.\n\nBut that contradicts my manual count of 50. So, perhaps the formula is counting from 0 to 488, but page numbers start at 1, so maybe I need to subtract the count for 0 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 0 in the tens place would be numbers 1-9, which don't have a tens digit. So, perhaps the formula is correct, but my manual count is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the formula. Let me try to apply it step by step.\n\nThe formula for the tens place is:\n\ncount_tens = (n // 100) * 10 + max(0, (n % 100 - d*10 + 1))\n\nSo, for d=4 and n=488:\n\nn//100=4 (since 4*100=400 \u2264488).\n\nn%100=88.\n\nSo, (88 -4*10 +1)=88-40+1=49.\n\nSo, max(0,49)=49.\n\nThus, count_tens=4*10 +49=89.\n\nBut that suggests that 4 appears 89 times in the tens place from 1 to 488, which contradicts my earlier manual count of 50.\n\nWait, that can't be right. There must be a misunderstanding here. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is correct, but I'm misapplying it because the tens place can have multiple digits beyond the hundreds place.\n\nWait, for example, in the range 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, when d=4, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, in each previous hundred block, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10 times.\n\nSo, total in tens place for 4's: 5 blocks (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488) each contributing 10 times, except the last block which only contributes 10 times because 440-449 is within 400-488.\n\nWait, so that's 5*10=50. So, why does the formula give 89?\n\nI think the formula might be counting all the tens digits from 0 to 488, including the hundreds place. Wait, no, the formula is for the tens place only.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is counting the number of times 4 appears in the tens place across all numbers from 0 to 488, including leading zeros, which would be incorrect for page numbers since page numbers don't have leading zeros.\n\nWait, but page numbers don't have leading zeros, so for example, page 4 is just '4', not '004'. So, the formula might not apply directly because it's designed for numbers with leading zeros, effectively treating all numbers as three-digit numbers.\n\nSo, perhaps I should adjust the formula to account for page numbers without leading zeros.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should not use the formula and stick to my manual counting, which seems more accurate.\n\nIn that case, I think my manual count of 50 for tens place 4's is correct, and the formula is giving a different result because it's considering leading zeros, which we don't have in page numbers.\n\nSo, I'll trust my manual count of 50 for tens place 4's, leading to a total of 188 4's.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:49\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nTotal 8's:98\n\nSo, difference:188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number, right? So, the pages go from 1 to 488.\n\nI guess the first thing I should do is figure out how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each position and then add them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every group of ten consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. For example, from 1-10, 4 is in 4, and 8 is in 8. Then from 11-20, 4 is in 14, and 8 is in 18, and so on.\n\nSo, how many full groups of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of ten and then a partial group of 8 numbers (481-488). In each full group, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48, and the number of 8's is also 48. But wait, in the partial group from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 484 have a 4 in the units place? Yes, it does. So that's one more 4. Similarly, 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more 8. Therefore, in the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 + 1 = 49, and the number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, so they're equal in the units place.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so the units digit goes up to 8, right? So, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (1-480) and then 481-488. So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 times (once per each group of ten) plus once in 484, making it 49. Similarly, 8 appears 48 times plus once in 488, so also 49. So, units place: 49 each.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 for each ten numbers. So, for example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 times, and 8 in 80-89, also 10 times. So, in each hundred, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place.\n\nHow many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial hundred from 401-488.\n\nIn each full hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and the same for 8. So, for 4 full hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times each. Now, in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 in 480-488, which is 9 times (since 488 is the last page, so 480-488 includes 480, 481, ..., 488, which is 9 numbers). Wait, no, 480-488 is actually 9 numbers because 480 is included. Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 times.\n\nWait, but 480 is part of the 401-488 range, right? So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, in the tens place, the total number of 4's is 40 (from the four full hundreds) plus 10, totaling 50. The number of 8's is 40 plus 9, which is 49. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Each full hundred contributes 10 times for both 4 and 8 in the tens place, so 4 full hundreds give 40 each. Then, in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more 4's. For 8's, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page, so from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers. So, 9 more 8's. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. So, in the tens place, 4's are more by 1.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 in 100-199, 2 in 200-299, 3 in 300-399, and 4 in 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 page numbers. How about 8? The hundreds digit is 8 in 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. That's a big difference.\n\nNow, let's add up all the occurrences for each digit.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me check my calculations again because 188 - 98 = 90, which seems like a lot. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? It's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. So, that's correct.\n\nBut let me check the tens place again. From 1-488, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. So, that's correct.\n\nIn the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I calculated the units place, I considered 48 full groups of ten and then a partial group. Each full group contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 each. Then, in the partial group from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both.\n\nIn the tens place, each full hundred contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8. So, four full hundreds give 40 each. Then, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449 (10 times) and 8 in 480-488 (9 times). So, 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 doesn't appear at all.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but I want to make sure I didn't double-count or miss any numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach it by considering each digit position separately and calculating the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each.\n\nLet me try another method to cross-verify.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears: floor(488 / 10) + (1 if 488 % 10 >= 4 else 0). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, for each ten numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so the number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to n is floor((n + 1) / 10) + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0). Wait, maybe a better way is to calculate how many complete groups of ten there are and then see if there's an extra.\n\nSo, for 488 pages, the number of complete groups of ten is 48 (since 48*10 = 480). Each group contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8. So, in these, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place:\n\nThe number of complete groups of a hundred is 4 (since 4*100=400). Each hundred contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 each. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So, for the tens digit, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, total tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\nThe hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, total counts:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nSo, I think that's correct. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number is a three-digit number, right? Because 488 is a three-digit number, so pages 1 through 9 are single digits, 10 through 99 are two digits, and 100 through 488 are three digits. \n\nWait, maybe I should consider all page numbers as three digits by padding with leading zeros. So page 1 would be 001, page 10 would be 010, and so on. This might make it easier to count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately. That sounds like a plan.\n\nSo, I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. For each place, I'll calculate how many times the digit 4 appears and how many times 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in a sequence of numbers. Since there are 488 pages, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, how many complete cycles of 10 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete cycles and then 8 extra numbers. \n\nIn each complete cycle of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does 8. So, for 48 complete cycles, the number of 4's in the units place is 48, and the same for 8's. Now, the remaining 8 numbers are 481 to 488. Let me list their units digits: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So, in these, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So, adding that, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and similarly, 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, they are equal.\n\nMoving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in each cycle. So, how many complete cycles of 100 are in 488? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete cycles and then 88 numbers left.\n\nIn each complete cycle, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, same for 8. So, 4 cycles give 4 * 10 = 40 occurrences for each digit. Now, the remaining 88 numbers are from 401 to 488. Wait, no, actually, the remaining numbers after 400 would be 401 to 488, but I think I need to consider how the tens digit behaves from 400 onwards.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to calculate how many times each digit appears in the tens place up to 488. Let me think. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers, so for each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for 400 pages, that would be 4 * 10 = 40 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place. But since we have 488 pages, which is 88 pages beyond 400.\n\nSo, the tens digits from 400 to 488: let's see, the tens digit in 400 is 0, then 410-419 have tens digit 1, 420-429 have 2, 430-439 have 3, 440-449 have 4, 450-459 have 5, 460-469 have 6, 470-479 have 7, 480-488 have 8. So, from 400 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 up to 8, but only up to 88, which is 488.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider how many times each digit appears in the tens place from 1 to 488. Let me try a different approach.\n\nIn the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So, for 488 numbers, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 = 40 for each digit.\n\nNow, the remaining 88 numbers are from 401 to 488. Let's see how the tens digits behave here. From 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), and 8 (481-488). Wait, but 488 is the end, so 481-488 is only 8 numbers, not 10.\n\nSo, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does each occur in the remaining 88 numbers?\n\nFrom 401-410: tens digit is 0, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 401-410 is 10 numbers, but 401 is included, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but 401-410 is 10 numbers, 411-420 is another 10, and so on up to 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, let's count how many times each digit appears in the tens place in the remaining 88 numbers.\n\n- Tens digit 0: 401-410 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 1: 411-420 \u2192 10\n- Tens digit 2: 421-430 \u2192 10\n- Tens digit 3: 431-440 \u2192 10\n- Tens digit 4: 441-450 \u2192 10\n- Tens digit 5: 451-460 \u2192 10\n- Tens digit 6: 461-470 \u2192 10\n- Tens digit 7: 471-480 \u2192 10\n- Tens digit 8: 481-488 \u2192 8 numbers\n\nSo, each tens digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times. Therefore, in the remaining 88 numbers, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nAdding this to the 40 occurrences from the first 400 pages, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's is 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, because in the first 400 pages, each digit appears 40 times in the tens place. Then, in the remaining 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 8 times. So total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400 pages have 4 cycles of 100, each contributing 10 times for each digit in the tens place, so 4*10=40 for 4 and 8. Then, from 401-488, which is 88 pages, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, as I listed. So, in those 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times (in 441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, yes, 4's total is 50, 8's is 48 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is a bit different because it only changes every 100 numbers. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so we can consider it as 0. From 100-199, it's 1; 200-299, 2; 300-399, 3; 400-488, 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. How about 8? Well, the hundreds digit is 8 only from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n- Units place: 49 4's and 49 8's\n- Tens place: 50 4's and 48 8's\n- Hundreds place: 89 4's and 0 8's\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nWait, that can't be right because 188 - 97 is 91, which seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units place. Let me recalculate the units place. For units digit, each digit 0-9 appears equally often. There are 488 pages, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, meaning 48 full cycles and 8 extra numbers.\n\nIn each cycle, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, 48 * 1 = 48 for each. Then, the remaining 8 numbers are 481-488, whose units digits are 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: As before, 40 from the first 400 pages, then in the remaining 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, 40 +10=50 for 4, and 40 +8=48 for 8. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So, 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those 89. So, that's correct. For 8's, since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so 0.\n\nIn the tens place, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me recount the tens digits in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488). So, from 401-488, how many times does each tens digit appear?\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 411-420: 1 \u2192 10\n- 421-430: 2 \u219210\n- 431-440:3 \u219210\n- 441-450:4 \u219210\n- 451-460:5 \u219210\n- 461-470:6 \u219210\n- 471-480:7 \u219210\n- 481-488:8 \u21928 numbers\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (from 441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (from 481-488). So, in the tens place, 4's are 10 more than 8's in the remaining 88 numbers.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place, 4's are 40 +10=50, 8's are 40 +8=48.\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I should calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each place separately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model each digit place separately.\n\nFor units place:\n\nTotal numbers: 488\n\nNumber of times a digit appears in units place: floor(488 / 10) * 1 + (1 if the remaining numbers include the digit else 0)\n\nWait, more accurately, for units digit, the count for digit d is:\n\ncount = (n // 10) * 1 + min(max(n % 10 - d + 1, 0), 1) if d !=0 else (n //10) *1 + (n %10 >=0)\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to think that for each digit d in units place, the number of times it appears is (n // 10) + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0) if d !=0, else (n //10).\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's take d=4.\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in units place:\n\nNumber of complete decades: 488 //10 = 48, each contributing 1 occurrence of 4.\n\nThen, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), how many have units digit >=4? 484 and 488, so two numbers? Wait, no, the remaining numbers after 48*10=480 are 481-488, which are 8 numbers. The units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total 4's in units place: 48 +1=49, 8's:48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in tens place:\n\nNumber of complete centuries: 488 //100 =4, each contributing 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nThen, the remaining 88 numbers (401-488). In these, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? From 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, total 4's in tens place: 4*10 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place:\n\nIn the remaining 88 numbers, 8 appears in the tens place from 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times. So, total 8's in tens place:4*10 +8=48.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor 4's: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nFor 8's: None, since the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units)+48 (tens)+0=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 1-399, the hundreds digit is 0,1,2,3. From 400-488, it's 4. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, which is correct. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488.\n\nSo, yes, 89 4's in hundreds place, 0 8's.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 97, so 188-97=91.\n\nWait, but I feel like that's a lot. Let me check another way. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place and sum them up.\n\nAnother approach: For each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nUnits place:\n\nAs before, 49 each.\n\nTens place:\n\n4's:50, 8's:48.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's:89, 8's:0.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit, how many times does it appear?\n\n- 0:10 times (401-410)\n-1:10 (411-420)\n-2:10 (421-430)\n-3:10 (431-440)\n-4:10 (441-450)\n-5:10 (451-460)\n-6:10 (461-470)\n-7:10 (471-480)\n-8:8 (481-488)\n\nSo, in the tens place from 401-488, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times. So, in the tens place, 4's are 10 more than 8's in this range. So, overall, in the tens place, 4's are 50, 8's are 48.\n\nSimilarly, in the hundreds place, 4's are 89, 8's are 0.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's:49+50+89=188, 8's:49+48+0=97.\n\nDifference:91.\n\nWait, but let me check if I didn't double count any numbers. For example, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, each number is counted once for the hundreds digit. Similarly, the tens and units digits are counted separately. So, no overlaps in counting.\n\nAnother way to think about it: Each page number is a three-digit number, and each digit is considered separately. So, the counts are independent.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nIt's every 10 numbers:4,14,24,...,484. So, how many terms are there in this sequence?\n\nThe first term is 4, the last term is 484. The common difference is 10.\n\nNumber of terms: ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place:8,18,28,...,488.\n\nLast term is 488. So, ((488-8)/10)+1=(480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. So, units place is correct.\n\nTens place: For 4's, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nFrom 40-49,140-149,...,440-449.\n\nEach hundred contributes 10 times, and there are 4 hundreds (1-100,101-200,...,301-400), so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40+10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place: from 80-89,180-189,...,380-389, and in 401-488, 480-488.\n\nSo, from 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 times for 8's in tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's 9 times, not 8. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 8 because 481-488 is 8 numbers, but actually, 480 is included, so it's 9 numbers. Wait, but 480 is part of 481-488? No, 480 is separate. Wait, no, 480 is in the 480-489 range, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers:480,481,...,488.\n\nWait, so in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 times, not 8. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times, not 8. Therefore, in the tens place, 8's are 40 (from 1-400) +9=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 8, but that was incorrect. Let me recast this.\n\nSo, from 401-488, the tens digits go up to 8, but the numbers are 401-488. So, the tens digit 8 starts at 480, which is within 401-488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the remaining 88 numbers.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place, 4's:10, 8's:9.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place:40+10=50, 8's:40+9=49.\n\nWait, that changes things. So, now, in the tens place, 4's are 50, 8's are 49.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, both are 49.\n\nHundreds place:4's=89, 8's=0.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so I had an error earlier in counting the number of times 8 appears in the tens place in the remaining 88 numbers. It's actually 9 times, not 8, because 480 is included, making it 9 numbers.\n\nSo, correcting that, the total 8's in the tens place is 40 +9=49, not 48 as I previously thought. So, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, that's different from my previous calculation. So, where did I go wrong earlier? I think I miscounted the number of times 8 appears in the tens place from 401-488. It's actually 9 times, not 8, because 480 is included, making it 9 numbers.\n\nSo, let me recast the entire calculation with this correction.\n\nUnits place:\n\n4's:49, 8's:49\n\nTens place:\n\n4's:50, 8's:49\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's:89, 8's:0\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me verify again. From 401-488, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place?\n\nThey are 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, in the tens place, 8's are 40 (from 1-400) +9=49.\n\nSo, yes, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nTherefore, total 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me think of another way. Maybe I can calculate the total number of 4's and 8's in each digit place and sum them up.\n\nAnother approach: For each digit place, calculate the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nUnits place:\n\nAs before, 49 each.\n\nTens place:\n\n4's:50, 8's:49\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's:89, 8's:0\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. By analyzing each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately, we determine the counts as follows:\n\n- **Units place**: Each digit appears 49 times for both 4 and 8.\n- **Tens place**: 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place**: 4 appears 89 times, and 8 does not appear.\n\nSumming these, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98. The difference is:\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number, right? So, pages 1 to 9 are single-digit, 10 to 99 are two-digit, and 100 to 488 are three-digit numbers.\n\nI think the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately.\n\nFirst, the units place. For the units digit, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive page numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place, same with the digit 8. But since the book goes up to 488, I need to check how many complete blocks of 10 there are and then see if there are any leftover numbers beyond that.\n\nSo, from page 1 to 488, there are 488 page numbers. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48 complete blocks of 10 and 8 leftover pages. In each complete block, the units digit is 4 once and 8 once. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 times 1, which is 48, and the same for 8's, which is also 48. But wait, I have 8 leftover pages, which are pages 481 to 488. Let me check if any of these have 4 or 8 in the units place.\n\nLooking at pages 481 to 488: the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, page 484 has a 4 in the units place, and page 488 has an 8. So, that's one more 4 and one more 8 in the units place. So, the total for units place is 48 + 1 = 49 for 4's and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8's. Hmm, so in the units place, both digits appear the same number of times, 49 each.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for example, in the 0-99 range, the tens digit is 4 ten times (40-49), and 8 ten times (80-89). Similarly, in the next hundred, 100-199, the tens digit is 4 ten times (140-149), and 8 ten times (180-189), and so on.\n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, there are four complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages in the next hundred (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8. So, for four complete hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times for 4's and 4 * 10 = 40 times for 8's.\n\nNow, looking at the incomplete hundred from 401 to 488. The tens digit here ranges from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-490). But since we only go up to 488, the last tens digit is 8, but only up to 488.\n\nIn the tens place for this incomplete hundred, how many times does 4 appear? It would be in 440-449, which is 10 times. But wait, our range is only up to 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488, so that's 10 times. Similarly, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? It would be in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 times (480-488). Wait, but 488 is included, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in this last partial hundred.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. From 401 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in this last partial hundred. Similarly, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in the same partial hundred (440-449). So, adding that to the four complete hundreds, the total for the tens place is 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me double-check. For the tens place in 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, yes, that's correct. So, total for tens place: 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488. How many times is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit only goes up to 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, the count for 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nWait, that makes sense because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, and before that, it's 1, 2, 3. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8's count is 0.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit position.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate that. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place: 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each, then the last 8 pages (481-488) add one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488). So, units total is 49 each. That's correct.\n\nTens place: For each complete hundred, 10 times each digit in the tens place, so 4 and 8 each appear 10 times per hundred, so four hundreds give 40 each. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (from 400-488), and 8 never appears. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up:\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding the difference.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 pages.\n   - 488 pages mean 48 full decades (480 pages) and 8 extra pages (481-488).\n   - 4 and 8 each appear 48 times in the units place.\n   - In the extra pages, 484 has a 4 and 488 has an 8.\n   - Total: 49 for both 4 and 8.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - 488 pages have 4 full hundreds (400 pages) and 88 extra pages.\n   - In full hundreds, 4 and 8 each appear 40 times.\n   - In 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 for 4 and 49 for 8.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, appearing 89 times.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 for 4 and 0 for 8.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number is a three-digit number, right? From 1 to 488. Wait, actually, page 1 is just a single digit, but as we go on, the numbers become two digits and then three digits. Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. I think the number of times a particular digit appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which isn't a whole number. So maybe it's 48 full cycles of 0-9 and then an extra 8 pages. So for the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times, and then from 491 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So for the digit 4, in the units place, it appears 48 times plus once more in 494? Wait, no, 494 is beyond 488. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So for 488 pages, how many complete cycles of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times in the units place, and then the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488) will have units digits from 1 to 8. So the digit 4 appears 48 times in the units place, and then once more in 484, right? So that's 49 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 48 times in the units place, and then once more in 488, so also 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so units digit 8 appears once more. So both 4 and 8 in the units place occur 49 times each.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 1 to 480, each digit appears exactly 48 times in the units place because 480 is 48*10. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1 through 8. So digit 4 appears once in the units place (484), and digit 8 appears once in 488. So total units digits: 48 +1 = 49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nNow moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So for 488 pages, how many hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 times each digit appears in the tens place. But wait, we have 488 pages, which is 4 full hundreds plus 88 pages. So the next partial hundred is 401-488, which is 88 pages.\n\nIn the tens place, the digits go from 0 to 9 every 100 pages. So in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), and then 8 (481-488). Wait, but 488 is page 488, so the tens digit is 8 for pages 481-488, which is 8 pages. So in the tens place, digit 4 appears 10 times in the 400s (401-410, 411-420, etc.), but wait, no, in the 400s, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, etc., up to 8 for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 pages.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The tens digit in each hundred is 0-9 for 10 pages each. So in the 400s, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So for the tens digit, how many times does 4 appear? It appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, but since we only go up to 488, 440-449 is fully included, so that's 10 times. Similarly, 8 in the tens place appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 pages? Wait, no, 480-489 is 10 pages, but we stop at 488, so 480-488 is 9 pages. Wait, but 480 is included, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 pages. Wait, but 480 is page 480, so 480-488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all those pages. So digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the 400s.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought each hundred contributes 10 times each digit in the tens place, but in the last partial hundred, it's less. So total for the tens place:\n\nFor digit 4: in the 400s, it's 10 times (440-449). For digit 8: in the 400s, it's 9 times (480-488). But wait, in the 400s, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 pages. So total for digit 8 in the tens place: 9 times.\n\nWait, but I think I might be making a mistake here. Let me try a different approach. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages, so for each hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So for 488 pages, which is 4 full hundreds (1-400) and 88 pages (401-488). So in the full hundreds (1-400), each digit appears 4*10=40 times in the tens place. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? It's in 440-449, which is 10 pages, but since we're only going up to 488, 440-449 is fully included, so that's 10 times. Similarly, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? It's in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488 inclusive). So total for digit 4 in the tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) +10=50 times. For digit 8: 40 (from full hundreds) +9=49 times.\n\nWait, but wait, in the 400s, from 401-488, the tens digit for 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so that's correct. For 8, it's in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so yes, 9 times. So total for the tens place: 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. Wait, no, 300-399 is hundreds digit 3, and 400-488 is hundreds digit 4. So how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences for each digit:\n\nFor digit 4:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal: 49 +50 +89= 188 times\n\nFor digit 8:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal: 49 +49 +0= 98 times\n\nSo the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n- Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place up to page 480.\n- Then from 481-488, units digits are 1-8, so each digit 1-8 appears once more.\n- So 4 appears 48 +1=49 times.\n- 8 appears 48 +1=49 times.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred contributes 10 times each digit in the tens place.\n- Up to 400, that's 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40 times each digit.\n- From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8.\n- Digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times.\n- Digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times.\n- So total for 4: 40 +10=50\n- For 8: 40 +9=49\n\nHundreds place:\n- Digit 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times.\n- Digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total counts:\n- 4: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n- 8:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place up to page 480.\n   - From 481-488, digits 1-8 each appear once more.\n   - **4's:** 48 + 1 = 49\n   - **8's:** 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of each digit.\n   - Up to page 400, each digit appears 40 times in the tens place.\n   - From 401-488:\n     - **4's:** Appear in 440-449 (10 times).\n     - **8's:** Appear in 480-488 (9 times).\n   - **4's:** 40 + 10 = 50\n   - **8's:** 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **4's:** Appear from 400-488 (89 times).\n   - **8's:** Do not appear in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number, right? So, page 1 is just 1, page 10 is 10, and page 100 is 100, up to page 488. \n\nI think the best way to approach this is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) separately and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have the total counts for both digits, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position one by one.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 consecutive page numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. Similarly, the digit 8 also appears once. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra pages. So, in each of these 48 sets, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for the units place, the count for 4 is 48, and the same for 8.\n\nBut wait, there are 8 extra pages after 480, which are 481 to 488. Let me check the units digits here: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, adding these to the previous counts, the units place contributes 48 + 1 = 49 for 4 and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8. Wait, that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so the units digits beyond 480 are only up to 488, so maybe I should think again.\n\nWait, maybe a better way is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position without splitting into sets. Let me think again.\n\nFor the units place:\n- The number of times 4 appears is equal to how many times 4 is in the units digit from 1 to 488.\n- Similarly for 8.\n\nSince every 10 numbers, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. So, the total number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete tens in 488 plus any extra if the last page is beyond the next multiple of 10.\n\nWait, 488 is 48*10 + 8, so the number of complete tens is 48, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So total for 4 in units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and for 8, it's 48 +1 = 49. Wait, that would mean both 4 and 8 have 49 appearances in the units place, but that can't be correct because 488 is the last page, so maybe I'm overcounting.\n\nWait, no, because 488 is included, so the units digits from 481 to 488 are 1 to 8, so 484 is included, and 488 is included, so yes, each adds one more. So units place: 49 for 4, 49 for 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So, for example, from 1 to 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place from 40 to 49, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears from 80 to 89, 10 times.\n\nNow, how many hundreds are in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times as well.\n\nSo, for 400-488, that's the fourth hundred. Now, in the tens place, from 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place from 440 to 449, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears from 480 to 489, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 9 times (480-488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so 9 times. Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9. Hmm, but wait, 480 is included, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 times.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in the last partial hundred.\n\nSo, for the tens place:\n\n- For 4: in each full hundred, 10 times. There are 4 full hundreds, so 4*10=40 times. Plus in 400-488, 440-449 is 10 times, so total for 4 in tens place is 40 +10=50.\n\nWait, no, because 400-488 is part of the fourth hundred, so maybe I should consider it differently. Wait, perhaps I should calculate it as:\n\nFor each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9, each appearing 10 times. So, for 488 pages, how many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Then, the remaining pages are 401-488, which is 88 pages.\n\nSo, in each full hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so 4*10=40 times. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times per hundred, so 4*10=40 times.\n\nNow, in the remaining pages 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's from 440-449, which is 10 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 times (480-488).\n\nSo, in the tens place:\n\n- 4 appears 40 (from full hundreds) +10 (from 440-449) =50 times.\n- 8 appears 40 (from full hundreds) +9 (from 480-488) =49 times.\n\nWait, that makes sense because in the last partial hundred, 8 only appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, the digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, and 4 for 300-399, and then 4 again for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, 89 times.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in 488, the hundreds digit is 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n- For 4's in hundreds place: 89 times.\n- For 8's in hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the counts for 4 and 8.\n\nFor 4:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89 = 188 times.\n\nFor 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's: 49 +49 +0 =98 times.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from total 4's: 188 -98 =90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n- Each 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. There are 48 full tens in 488, so 48 times each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, 48+1=49 for both, correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each full hundred has 10 times 4 and 10 times 8 in the tens place. 4 full hundreds, so 40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449 (10 times) and 8 in 480-488 (9 times). So, 40+10=50 for 4, 40+9=49 for 8. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place, correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89 =188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about the hundreds place: from 1-399, the hundreds digit is 1,2,3, so 4 doesn't appear in the hundreds place until 400. So, 400-488 is 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so 488 is the last page, so 400-488 is 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, correct.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number, right?\n\nWait, actually, since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers can be one-digit (1-9), two-digit (10-99), or three-digit (100-488). I think I should consider each of these ranges separately because the way digits appear might differ.\n\nFirst, let me handle the one-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digits 4 and 8 each appear exactly once, right? So, for one-digit numbers, the count of 4's is 1 and the count of 8's is also 1. So, the difference here is 0. Hmm, okay, so the difference so far is zero.\n\nNext, I need to look at the two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Each two-digit number has a tens place and a ones place. I think I should calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place separately.\n\nStarting with the tens place: For the tens digit, the numbers go from 10 to 99, so the tens digits range from 1 to 9. For each tens digit, there are 10 numbers (e.g., 10-19, 20-29, etc.). So, for the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, when the tens digit is 4, the numbers are 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place when the tens digit is 8 (80-89).\n\nNow, for the ones place in two-digit numbers: The ones digits cycle from 0 to 9 for each tens group. So, in each set of ten numbers (like 10-19), each digit from 0-9 appears exactly once in the ones place. Since there are 9 sets of ten (10-99), each digit from 0-9 appears 9 times in the ones place. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, for each digit in the ones place, it appears once per ten numbers, and there are 9 tens groups (10-99 is 90 numbers, so 9 groups of 10). So, each digit from 0-9 appears 9 times in the ones place. Therefore, 4 appears 9 times and 8 appears 9 times in the ones place for two-digit numbers.\n\nWait, but when I'm considering two-digit numbers, the ones place can include 0, but the tens place can't be 0. So, for the ones place, each digit from 0-9 appears 9 times, as there are 9 tens groups (10-99). So, 4 and 8 each appear 9 times in the ones place.\n\nSo, putting it together for two-digit numbers: In the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 10 times. In the ones place, 4 appears 9 times and 8 appears 9 times. So, total for two-digit numbers, 4 appears 10 + 9 = 19 times, and 8 appears 10 + 9 = 19 times. So, again, the difference is zero in two-digit numbers.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. For the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (40-49) and 8 appears 10 times (80-89). For the ones place, in each of the 9 tens groups, 4 appears once, so 9 times, same for 8. So, yes, 19 each. So, no difference in two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because there are three places: hundreds, tens, and ones.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book has 488 pages. So, the hundreds digit ranges from 1 to 4.\n\n- For hundreds digit 1: The numbers are from 100 to 199. So, there are 100 numbers here.\n- For hundreds digit 2: 200-299, another 100 numbers.\n- For hundreds digit 3: 300-399, another 100 numbers.\n- For hundreds digit 4: 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 is the last page).\n\nNow, let's calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place: hundreds, tens, and ones.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4 at maximum, and 8 isn't present in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, moving to the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0-9 for each hundreds group, but we have to consider up to 488 for the last group.\n\nLet's break it down by hundreds:\n\n1. Hundreds digit 1 (100-199): The tens digit can be 0-9, and for each tens digit, there are 10 numbers. So, for each digit in the tens place, it appears 10 times. So, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here?\n\n- 4 appears in the tens place for 140-149, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n- 8 appears in the tens place for 180-189, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\n2. Hundreds digit 2 (200-299): Similarly, the tens digit cycles 0-9, so:\n\n- 4 appears in 240-249: 10 times.\n- 8 appears in 280-289: 10 times.\n\n3. Hundreds digit 3 (300-399): Same logic:\n\n- 4 appears in 340-349: 10 times.\n- 8 appears in 380-389: 10 times.\n\n4. Hundreds digit 4 (400-488): Here, the tens digit can go from 0-8 because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, 400-488 includes tens digits up to 8, but let me check:\n\nWait, 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, the tens digit can be 0 (400-409), 1 (410-419), ..., up to 8 (480-488). But 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, for the tens digit in 400-488:\n\n- Tens digit 0: 400-409 (10 numbers)\n- Tens digit 1: 410-419 (10 numbers)\n- ...\n- Tens digit 8: 480-488 (9 numbers)\n\nSo, for the tens digit in 400-488, 4 appears when the tens digit is 4, which would be 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. Similarly, 8 appears when the tens digit is 8, which is 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nWait, so in the hundreds digit 4 group:\n\n- Tens digit 4: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n- Tens digit 8: 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, adding up all the hundreds groups:\n\n- For 4 in the tens place: 10 (hundreds 1) + 10 (hundreds 2) + 10 (hundreds 3) + 10 (hundreds 4) = 40 times.\n- For 8 in the tens place: 10 (hundreds 1) + 10 (hundreds 2) + 10 (hundreds 3) + 9 (hundreds 4) = 39 times.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check again. In hundreds 4, the tens digit 8 only goes up to 488, so it's 9 numbers, not 10. So yes, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place for hundreds 4. So total for 8 in tens place is 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nNow, moving on to the ones place in three-digit numbers. For each hundreds group, the ones digit cycles from 0-9 for each tens group. So, for each hundreds group, each digit appears 10 times in the ones place per tens group, but we have to adjust for the last group if it's cut short.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider each hundreds group and how many times each digit appears in the ones place.\n\n1. Hundreds digit 1 (100-199): For each tens group (100-109, 110-119, ..., 190-199), the ones digit cycles 0-9. There are 10 tens groups, each contributing one occurrence of each digit in the ones place. So, for 4 and 8, each appears 10 times in the ones place.\n\n2. Similarly, hundreds digit 2 (200-299): Each digit appears 10 times in the ones place.\n\n3. Hundreds digit 3 (300-399): Each digit appears 10 times in the ones place.\n\n4. Hundreds digit 4 (400-488): Now, this is where it's a bit different because the last tens group is 480-488, which is only 9 numbers. So, for the ones place in 400-488:\n\n- For tens digits 0-8: Each tens group (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488) has 10 numbers except the last one, which has 9.\n\nWait, but when considering the ones place, each digit 0-9 appears once per tens group. So, for tens groups 0-8 (i.e., 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488), the ones digit cycles 0-9 except for the last group, which only goes up to 8.\n\nWait, no, actually, in 480-488, the ones digits are 0-8, so digits 0-8 appear once, and 9 doesn't appear. So, for each tens group from 400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479, each has 10 numbers, so each digit 0-9 appears once in the ones place for each of these 9 tens groups (from 400-409 up to 470-479). Then, in 480-488, the ones digits go from 0-8, so digits 0-8 appear once, and 9 doesn't appear.\n\nSo, for the ones place in hundreds digit 4:\n\n- For digits 0-8: They appear 10 times each in the first 8 tens groups (400-409 to 470-479), and once more in the last partial group (480-488). So, 10 + 1 = 11 times each for digits 0-8.\n- For digit 9: It appears 10 times in the first 8 tens groups but not in the last partial group, so 10 times total.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit off. Let me think again. Each tens group from 400-409 to 470-479 has 10 numbers, so each digit 0-9 appears once in the ones place for each of these 8 tens groups (wait, actually, from 400-409 is the first, then 410-419 is the second, up to 470-479, which is the eighth, and then 480-488 is the ninth). So, for each digit 0-9, they appear 8 times in the first eight tens groups, and then in the ninth group (480-488), digits 0-8 appear once each, and 9 doesn't appear.\n\nSo, for digits 0-8: 8 times in the first eight groups plus 1 time in the ninth group, totaling 9 times each.\nFor digit 9: 8 times in the first eight groups, and 0 times in the ninth group, so 8 times total.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, in the ones place for hundreds digit 4:\n\n- Each digit 0-8 appears 9 times.\n- Digit 9 appears 8 times.\n\nTherefore, in the ones place for hundreds digit 4:\n\n- 4 appears 9 times.\n- 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, but let me verify. For each tens group from 400-409 to 470-479 (8 groups), each digit 0-9 appears once in the ones place, so 8 times each. Then, in 480-488, digits 0-8 appear once each, so adding 1 more time for digits 0-8, making it 9 times each. So yes, 4 and 8 each appear 9 times in the ones place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nSo, now, adding up the ones place across all hundreds groups:\n\n- Hundreds 1: 10 times each for 4 and 8.\n- Hundreds 2: 10 times each for 4 and 8.\n- Hundreds 3: 10 times each for 4 and 8.\n- Hundreds 4: 9 times each for 4 and 8.\n\nSo, total for ones place:\n\n- 4: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n- 8: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, in the ones place across all three-digit numbers, 4 and 8 each appear 39 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in hundreds digit 4, 4 and 8 each appear 9 times in the ones place. So, adding up:\n\n- Hundreds 1: 10\n- Hundreds 2: 10\n- Hundreds 3: 10\n- Hundreds 4: 9\nTotal: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, let's summarize the three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 4 appears 89 times.\n  - 8 appears 0 times.\n\n- Tens place:\n  - 4 appears 40 times.\n  - 8 appears 39 times.\n\n- Ones place:\n  - 4 appears 39 times.\n  - 8 appears 39 times.\n\nSo, total for three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (ones) = 89 + 40 = 129 + 39 = 168 times.\n- 8: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (ones) = 0 + 39 + 39 = 78 times.\n\nWait, let me check that again. For 4 in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds: 89\n- Tens: 40\n- Ones: 39\nTotal: 89 + 40 = 129; 129 + 39 = 168.\n\nFor 8 in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds: 0\n- Tens: 39\n- Ones: 39\nTotal: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's add up all the digits from one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- One-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 168 = 188.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- One-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, so total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big difference, and I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me go through each part again.\n\nFirst, one-digit numbers (1-9):\n\n- 4 appears once (page 4).\n- 8 appears once (page 8).\n\nTwo-digit numbers (10-99):\n\n- Tens place: 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n- Ones place: For each tens group, each digit 0-9 appears once. There are 9 tens groups (10-99), so 4 appears 9 times, 8 appears 9 times.\n- Total for two-digit numbers: 10 + 9 = 19 for both 4 and 8.\n\nThree-digit numbers (100-488):\n\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n  - 8 never appears in hundreds place.\n\n- Tens place:\n  - Hundreds 1: 40-49: 10 times, 80-89:10 times.\n  - Hundreds 2: 240-249:10, 280-289:10.\n  - Hundreds 3: 340-349:10, 380-389:10.\n  - Hundreds 4: 440-449:10 (since 440-449 is within 400-488), 480-488:9 (since it's cut short).\n  - So, 4 in tens place: 10+10+10+10=40.\n  - 8 in tens place: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\n- Ones place:\n  - For hundreds 1,2,3: each has 10 numbers per tens group, so 10 times each for 4 and 8.\n  - For hundreds 4: 9 times each for 4 and 8, as explained earlier.\n  - So, 4: 10+10+10+9=39.\n  - 8: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4: 89 (hundreds) +40 (tens)+39 (ones)= 168.\n- 8: 0 +39 +39=78.\n\nAdding all together:\n\n- 4's: 1 (one-digit) +19 (two-digit) +168 (three-digit)= 188.\n- 8's: 1 +19 +78=98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me check if I counted the three-digit numbers correctly, especially in the ones place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nIn hundreds digit 4, from 400-488, the ones place for 4 and 8:\n\n- For each tens group from 400-409 to 470-479 (8 groups), each digit 0-9 appears once, so 8 times each.\n- Then, in 480-488, digits 0-8 appear once each, so adding 1 more time for 0-8, making it 9 times each for 0-8, and 8 times for 9.\n\nSo, 4 and 8 each appear 9 times in the ones place for hundreds digit 4. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **One-Digit Page Numbers (1-9):**\n   - '4' appears once (page 4).\n   - '8' appears once (page 8).\n\n2. **Two-Digit Page Numbers (10-99):**\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - '4' appears 10 times (40-49).\n     - '8' appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - **Ones Place:**\n     - Each digit (0-9) appears 9 times (since there are 9 tens groups).\n     - '4' appears 9 times.\n     - '8' appears 9 times.\n   - **Total for Two-Digit Numbers:**\n     - '4': 10 + 9 = 19.\n     - '8': 10 + 9 = 19.\n\n3. **Three-Digit Page Numbers (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - '4' appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n     - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - Each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) contributes 10 times for both '4' and '8'.\n     - In 400-488, '4' appears 10 times (440-449) and '8' appears 9 times (480-488).\n     - **Total:**\n       - '4': 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40.\n       - '8': 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n   - **Ones Place:**\n     - For hundreds groups 100-399, each digit appears 10 times per group, totaling 30 times for each digit.\n     - In 400-488, each digit 0-8 appears 9 times (once in each tens group except the last partial group).\n     - **Total:**\n       - '4': 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n       - '8': 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n   - **Total for Three-Digit Numbers:**\n     - '4': 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (ones) = 168.\n     - '8': 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (ones) = 78.\n\n4. **Total Counts Across All Page Numbers:**\n   - **'4':** 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n   - **'8':** 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, I'll need to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. Similarly, from 11 to 20, it's 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0 again. So, the number of times a particular digit appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then considering the remainder if any.\n\nBut wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times in the units place, and then the digits 1 through 8 appear one more time in the units place because of the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488). So, for the digit 4, in the units place, it would be 48 times plus 1 more time because 484 is within the range. Wait, no, actually, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once in the units place here. So, total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, it's 48 times plus 1 more time because 488 is the last page. So, 48 + 1 = 49 as well. Wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking how many more 4's than 8's, so maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, let me double-check. From 1 to 480, each digit 0-9 appears exactly 48 times in the units place because 480 is a multiple of 10. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1 through 8, so each digit from 1 to 8 appears once more. So, for 4, units place: 48 + 1 = 49. For 8, units place: 48 + 1 = 49. So, same number so far.\n\nNow, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), then 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), etc., up to 9 (90-99). Each digit appears 10 times in the tens place per hundred.\n\nSince the book has 488 pages, that's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). So, for the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 4 times 10 = 40 times. Now, let's consider the remaining 88 pages (401-488). The tens digits here go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times do they appear?\n\nFrom 401-410, the tens digit is 0 for 10 numbers (401-410). Wait, no, 401-410 would have tens digit 0 for 401-410, which is 10 numbers, but 401 is actually the start, so from 401 to 410, the tens digit is 0. Then, 411-420: tens digit 1, and so on up to 481-488: tens digit 8, but only 8 numbers here because 488 is the end.\n\nSo, for the tens digit in the remaining 88 pages:\n\n- 0 appears 10 times (401-410)\n- 1 appears 10 times (411-420)\n- 2 appears 10 times (421-430)\n- 3 appears 10 times (431-440)\n- 4 appears 10 times (441-450)\n- 5 appears 10 times (451-460)\n- 6 appears 10 times (461-470)\n- 7 appears 10 times (471-480)\n- 8 appears 8 times (481-488)\n\nWait, but 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers, right? So, for the tens digit in the remaining 88 pages, 8 appears 8 times, and the others from 0 to 7 appear 10 times each, and 9 doesn't appear because we don't reach 490.\n\nSo, total tens place appearances for 4: 40 (from the first 400 pages) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place: 40 (from the first 400 pages) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 48 times.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place?\n\n- 1 appears 100 times (100-199)\n- 2 appears 100 times (200-299)\n- 3 appears 100 times (300-399)\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488, which is 89 numbers: 400 to 488 inclusive)\n\nWait, let me check that. From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n\nSo, for the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 doesn't appear at all in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So, 8's count in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFor digit 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from total 4's: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- 488 pages. For units digit, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing 1 occurrence of each digit). Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) contribute digits 1-8 in the units place. So, 4 appears once more, making units place 4's = 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, 8 appears once more, making units place 8's = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For the first 400 pages, each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place (since 400 \u00f7 100 = 4, and each hundred contributes 10 times per digit). Then, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). Each of the digits 0-7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times. So, for 4 in the tens place, it's 40 + 10 = 50. For 8, it's 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 doesn't appear at all.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 91.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place Analysis:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears 48 times in the units place for the first 480 pages.\n   - Pages 481-488 add one more 4 and one more 8 in the units place.\n   - Total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place Analysis:**\n   - Each digit appears 40 times in the tens place for the first 400 pages.\n   - Pages 401-488:\n     - 4 appears 10 more times (441-450).\n     - 8 appears 8 more times (481-488).\n   - Total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's in tens place: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place Analysis:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n   - Total 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - Total 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 91.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Each page number is a three-digit number, right? So pages go from 1 to 488. Wait, no, actually, page 1 is just one digit, page 10 is two digits, and starting from page 100, it's three digits up to 488. So I need to consider all these cases separately.\n\nMaybe I should calculate the number of times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers, and do the same for the digit 8, then subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference. That sounds like a plan.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each block of 10 numbers. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So each digit appears once in the units place every 10 numbers. But wait, the first page is 1, so does that affect it? Hmm, maybe I should adjust for that.\n\nWait, actually, from 1 to 488, the number of complete blocks of 10 is 48 (since 48*10=480), and then there are 8 more pages (481-488). So in each block of 10, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. But since the first block is 1-10, the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So 0 appears once, and digits 1-9 appear once each. Wait, but in the first block, 1-10, the digit 0 appears only once in the units place at page 10. So for each subsequent block of 10, like 11-20, the units digits again cycle through 1-0, so each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place.\n\nSo the total number of times each digit appears in the units place would be the number of complete blocks times 1, plus any extra in the incomplete block. But wait, for page 488, the last page, the units digit is 8. So from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, and then an extra 8 in the units place of 488. Wait, but actually, in each block, 4 appears once in the units place, and 8 appears once as well. So for 48 complete blocks, that's 48 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place. Then, in the incomplete block from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So in the units place, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So the difference in units place is zero.\n\nWait, that can't be right because I'm supposed to find how many more 4's than 8's, so maybe the difference isn't zero. Maybe I made a mistake in counting. Let me double-check. Each complete block of 10 contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 blocks give 48 each. Then the last partial block is pages 481-488, which is 8 pages, so the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So in this partial block, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So total units 4's: 48 +1 =49, units 8's:48 +1=49. So yes, units place gives equal counts, so difference is zero.\n\nNow let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So in each block of 100, the tens digit goes from 0-9 ten times each. Wait, no, actually, each digit in the tens place appears 10 times in each block of 100. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), then 1 (11-19), 2 (21-29), etc., up to 9 (91-99). Each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So for the tens place, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times per 100 pages.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488 pages? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial block from 401-488. Each complete block contributes 10 times each digit in the tens place, so for 4's and 8's, that's 4 blocks * 10 = 40 each in the tens place. Now, the partial block from 401-488: let's see, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-490), but since we're only going up to 488, the last tens digit is 8, but only 8 times (481-488). Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-489, but since we're stopping at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. Wait, no, 480 is page 480, and 488 is the last page. So the tens digit for 480-489 would be 8, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. Wait, but 480 is included, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 pages, each with tens digit 8. So in the partial block, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times. But wait, 480 is page 480, which is in the 401-488 range, right? So in the partial block, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So for 4's in the tens place, in the partial block, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see, the tens digit 4 would be in pages 440-449, but wait, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 4 would be from 440-449, which is 10 pages. But 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 pages. So in the partial block, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, but hold on, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included, but 489 isn't. So in the tens place for 480-488, that's 9 pages, right? From 480 to 488, that's 9 pages. So the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the partial block. So total tens place counts: 4's: 4 blocks *10=40, plus 10 in the partial block, total 50. 8's: 4 blocks *10=40, plus 9 in the partial block, total 49. So difference in tens place: 50 - 49 = 1.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. For the partial block 401-488, the tens digit 4 is from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. So yes, 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50, 8's:40 +9=49. So difference is +1 for 4's.\n\nNow let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, the hundreds digit cycles every 100 pages. So from 1-99, hundreds digit is 0 (since they are two-digit numbers), but wait, actually, in terms of page numbers, page 1 is just 1, not 001, so maybe I should consider it as a one-digit number. Hmm, perhaps it's better to treat all page numbers as three-digit numbers, padding with leading zeros if necessary, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, I can consider the hundreds digit as follows:\n\nFrom 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (since they are less than 100), but in reality, they don't have a hundreds digit. So maybe it's better to consider the hundreds digit only for pages 100 and above.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to think of all page numbers as three-digit numbers, so 001, 002, ..., 488. Then the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo in the hundreds place, digit 4 appears from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 +1 =89). So the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. The hundreds digit 8 would appear if the page number were 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit 8 never appears. So in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: pages 400-488 have hundreds digit 4, which is 89 pages. So 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and 8 appears 0 times. So the difference in hundreds place is +89 for 4's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each place:\n\n- Units place: 49 4's, 49 8's \u2192 difference 0\n- Tens place: 50 4's, 49 8's \u2192 difference +1\n- Hundreds place: 89 4's, 0 8's \u2192 difference +89\n\nTotal difference: 0 +1 +89 =90.\n\nWait, so 4's appear 90 more times than 8's in the page numbers.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place. Pages 400-488: 488 -400 +1=89 pages, so hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, I had 50 4's and 49 8's, so difference +1.\n\nUnits place: equal counts, so difference 0.\n\nSo total difference is 89 +1=90.\n\nWait, but let me cross-verify. Let's calculate total number of 4's and 8's.\n\nTotal 4's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal 4's=49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal 8's=49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So 4's appear 90 more times than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit's occurrence in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks of 10 pages in 480 pages, contributing 48 occurrences of each digit.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one more 4 and one more 8.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Difference: 0\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Four complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) contribute 40 occurrences of each digit.\n   - The partial block (401-488) adds 10 occurrences of 4 and 9 occurrences of 8.\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n   - Difference: +1\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages.\n   - The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n   - Difference: +89\n\n**Total Difference**:\n- Units: 0\n- Tens: +1\n- Hundreds: +89\n- Combined: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90\n\n**Answer**: The digit 4 appears 90 more times than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI think the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) separately and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nStarting with the digit 4, let's consider each position one by one.\n\nFirst, the units place. In the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 10, 4 appears once (at 4). From 11 to 20, it's again once at 14, and so on. So for each block of 10 numbers, there's one 4 in the units place. Since the book has 488 pages, we can divide 488 by 10 to find how many complete blocks of 10 there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So that means there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 more numbers. In each block, we have one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more at 484. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. If I have 488 pages, the units digit cycles every 10, so from 1 to 480, that's 480 numbers, which is 48 blocks of 10. Each block contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So 484 has a 4 in the units place, so that's one more, making it 49. That seems correct.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, from 101-200, the tens digit is 4 for 140-149, another 10. So each hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, how many hundreds do we have in 488 pages? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. Wait, no, more accurately, the hundreds digit goes from 1 to 4, since page 488 is 4 digits, but wait, actually, pages 1-99 are two-digit, 100-488 are three-digit. Hmm, maybe I should think of it differently.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to consider each position separately without considering the overall number of digits. So for the tens place, in each set of 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 ten times each. So for the tens digit being 4, each 100 numbers contribute 10 times 4 in the tens place. So from 1 to 400, that's 4 sets of 100, so 4 * 10 = 40 times. Then from 401 to 488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on. Wait, no, 401-410 would have tens digit 0, 411-420 tens digit 1, up to 480-489, which would have tens digit 8. Wait, but we only go up to 488, so up to 488, the tens digit goes up to 8. So in the 400-488 range, how many times does the tens digit equal 4? It would be from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's another 10. So total tens place 4's are 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50. Wait, but 488 is less than 490, so does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's correct, 50 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 tens digits of 4, so 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit cycles again. The next occurrence of tens digit 4 would be 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So 40 + 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. The hundreds digit is 4 for 400-499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 400-488, which is indeed 89 numbers. So that's 89 times 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So 4 appears 188 times.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's. So we'll count the number of times 8 appears in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with units place. Similar to 4's, each block of 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. So from 1-488, how many blocks of 10? 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So 48 blocks, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1-8, so 8 appears once at 488. So total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so the units digit is 8, so yes, that's correct. So units place 8's: 49.\n\nNext, tens place. In each set of 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So for the tens digit being 8, each 100 numbers contribute 10 times 8 in the tens place. From 1-400, that's 4 sets of 100, so 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit cycles again. The next occurrence of tens digit 8 would be 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So that's 9 times. So total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check. From 1-400, 40 times. Then from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nNow, hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, let me check again. Units: 49, tens: 49, hundreds: 0. So 49 + 49 = 98. That seems correct.\n\nSo now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then in the last 8 numbers (481-488), units digit 4 appears once at 484, so 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Tens: Each hundred contributes 10, so 4 hundreds (1-400) is 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, the next 80 numbers, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 40 +10=50.\n\n- Hundreds: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then in the last 8 numbers (481-488), units digit 8 appears once at 488, so 48 +1=49.\n\n- Tens: Each hundred contributes 10, so 4 hundreds (1-400) is 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 40 +9=49.\n\n- Hundreds: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 +49 +0=98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nSo the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. But wait, 480 is included in 401-488, right? So yes, 480 is the first number with tens digit 8 in that range, and it goes up to 488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So that's correct, 9 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** Each block of 10 numbers contributes 1 occurrence. There are 48 full blocks (480 pages) contributing 48, plus one more at 484, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences. From 1-400, that's 40. From 401-488, 440-449 adds 10, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, there are 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 48 full blocks contribute 48, plus one at 488, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** From 1-400, 40 occurrences. From 401-488, 480-488 contributes 9, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number is a three-digit number, right? From 1 to 488. Wait, actually, page 1 is just 1, page 10 is 10, so it's a mix of one, two, and three-digit numbers. Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every 10 pages, the units digit cycles through 0 to 9. So in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, in 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. Similarly, in 11-20, it's 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0 again. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 appears once. So, for the units place, the number of 4's and 8's is the same, right?\n\nNow, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks of 10, and then 8 extra pages (481 to 488). In each complete block, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for the units place, the count so far is 48 fours and 48 eights. Now, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, that's one more 4 and one more 8. So, adding that, units place gives us 49 fours and 49 eights. Wait, but wait, 481-488 is 8 pages, so units digits go from 1 to 8, so yes, 4 and 8 each appear once more. So, total in units place: 49 each.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. So, for each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for example, in 1-100, the tens digit cycles 0 (for 1-9), then 1 (10-19), up to 9 (90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times, and the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 488 is 4*100 + 88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. So, in each of these 4 hundreds, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 40 fours and 40 eights in the tens place.\n\nNow, what about the remaining pages from 401-488? Let's see, 488 - 400 = 88 pages. So, from 401 to 488, that's 88 pages. The tens digit here cycles through 0-9 for each ten. So, let's break it down:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nWait, but 401-488 is 88 pages, so each of these tens digits from 0 to 8 appears exactly 10 times except for the last one, which is 8 and goes from 481-488, which is 8 pages (481-488). So, in the tens place from 401-488:\n\n- 0 appears 10 times (401-410)\n- 1 appears 10 times (411-420)\n- 2 appears 10 times (421-430)\n- 3 appears 10 times (431-440)\n- 4 appears 10 times (441-450)\n- 5 appears 10 times (451-460)\n- 6 appears 10 times (461-470)\n- 7 appears 10 times (471-480)\n- 8 appears 8 times (481-488)\n\nWait, but 481-488 is 8 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 pages, not 10. So, in the tens place, in 401-488, the digit 4 appears 10 times, and the digit 8 appears 8 times. So, adding this to our previous total for the tens place:\n\nTotal fours in tens place: 40 (from 4 hundreds) + 10 (from 401-450) = 50\nTotal eights in tens place: 40 (from 4 hundreds) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the 4 hundreds would be 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. So, each of these contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 4*10=40 fours and 4*10=40 eights. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 times, and the tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 times. So, total in tens place:\n\nFours: 40 + 10 = 50\nEights: 40 + 8 = 48\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Because from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, with each digit appearing 10 times except for 8, which appears 8 times. So, the digit 4 in the tens place from 401-488 is in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. The digit 8 in the tens place is in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 eights. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. Wait, no, pages 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit, so the hundreds digit is 0, but since we're only considering the printed digits, maybe we can ignore leading zeros. Wait, but page numbers don't have leading zeros, so pages 1-99 are just one or two digits. So, the hundreds digit is only present from page 100 onwards. So, let's think about how many times each digit appears in the hundreds place.\n\nFrom 1-99: hundreds digit doesn't exist, so no contribution.\nFrom 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so 100 times 1.\nFrom 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, 100 times.\nFrom 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, 100 times.\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, 89 times (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\nWait, 400-488 is 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times, and the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal eights: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nSo, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 97. The difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with units place: 488 pages. Each 10 pages, units digits cycle 0-9. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing 1 four and 1 eight. So, 48 fours and 48 eights. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so that's one more four and one more eight. So, units place total: 49 fours, 49 eights. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) give 4*10=40 fours and 4*10=40 eights. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450 (10 times), and 8 appears in 481-488 (8 times). So, tens place total: 40 + 10 = 50 fours, 40 + 8 = 48 eights. That adds up.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, hundreds digit is 4, 89 times. So, 89 fours. No eights in hundreds place. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Eights: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97. Difference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. Pages 400-488: that's 89 pages, right? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nAnother way to check: total number of digits. Let's see, from 1-9: 9 numbers, 1 digit each: 9 digits. From 10-99: 90 numbers, 2 digits each: 180 digits. From 100-488: 389 numbers, 3 digits each: 1167 digits. Total digits: 9 + 180 + 1167 = 1356 digits.\n\nNow, total number of fours: 188, and eights: 97. So, total digits accounted for by fours and eights: 188 + 97 = 285. That seems reasonable, but maybe I can check another way.\n\nAlternatively, let's calculate the number of fours and eights in each place again.\n\nUnits place:\n\nTotal units digits: 488 numbers. Each digit 0-9 appears floor(488/10) = 48 times, with a remainder of 8. So, digits 1-8 appear one more time in the units place. So, digits 1-8 appear 49 times, and 0 appears 48 times. So, 4 appears 49 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the tens place, because 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 times per digit, so 4*10=40. Then, the remaining 88 pages (401-488) contribute 8 more times for each digit in the tens place except for the last digit, which only goes up to 8. Wait, no, the tens digit cycles 0-9 for each hundred, so in 401-488, which is 88 pages, the tens digit cycles through 0-8, with 8 appearing only 8 times instead of 10. So, for the tens place:\n\nDigits 0-7: each appear 10 times in 401-480 (80 pages), and then in 481-488, the tens digit is 8 for 8 pages. So, digits 0-7: 10 times each, digit 8: 8 times. So, total in tens place:\n\nDigits 0-7: 4*10 + 10 = 50? Wait, no, wait. Wait, in the first 400 pages, each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place (4 hundreds * 10). Then, in 401-488, which is 88 pages, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Each digit 0-7 appears 10 times (in 401-410, 411-420, etc.), and digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, in the tens place, digits 0-7 get an extra 10 each, and digit 8 gets an extra 8. So, total in tens place:\n\nFours: 40 (from first 400) + 10 (from 401-450) = 50\nEights: 40 (from first 400) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times. So, fours: 89, eights: 0.\n\nAdding up:\n\nFours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\nEights: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 91 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 91.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488.\n\nI think the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in each position.\n\n1. Units place: The digits cycle every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, it's 48 full cycles of 10, giving us 48 fours. But wait, does 488 include an extra 4 in the units place? Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so the last complete set is 480-488, where the units digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, yes, the units digit 4 appears 48 times.\n\nWait, but actually, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (each 10 numbers) plus an extra 8 numbers (481 to 488). So in each full cycle, 4 appears once in the units place, so 48 times. Then in the extra 8 numbers, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (484). So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, no, actually, from 1 to 488, the number of times the units digit is 4 is equal to the number of complete decades (each 10 numbers) which is 48 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete decades), each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the incomplete decade from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place, adding one more. So total units 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For each hundred, the tens digit runs from 0 to 9 for each set of ten. So for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). \n\nSince we're dealing with 488 pages, let's see how many hundreds we have. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then the 401-488 range.\n\nIn each full hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4 hundreds would have 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, ..., up to 8 for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 appears from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers, but we're looking for the tens digit 4. Wait, in 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So when the tens digit is 4, that's 440-449. How many numbers is that? From 440 to 449, that's 10 numbers, but wait, our book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488, right? Because 449 is less than 488. So that's another 10 times. So total tens place 4's: 40 (from the first 400 pages) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check again. From 1-100, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 sets of 10, making 50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that's correct. So total tens place 4's: 50.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40, plus 10 from 440-449, totaling 50. That seems correct.\n\n3. Hundreds place: Now, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 page numbers.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So there are 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. Units place: How many times does 8 appear in the units place? Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many complete decades are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the incomplete decade from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place. So that's one more. So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: How many times does 8 appear in the tens place? The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For each hundred, the tens digit runs through 0-9, so 8 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n\nFrom 1 to 488, we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, that's from 480 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the 401-488 range. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So yes, 9 times.\n\n3. Hundreds place: How many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So the hundreds place contributes 0 times.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems right. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** Every 10 numbers, '4' appears once. There are 48 full decades (488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8), contributing 48 fours. The incomplete decade (481-488) adds one more, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens place:** In each hundred, '4' appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). There are 5 sets (0-400), contributing 50 fours.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, '4' appears in the hundreds place 89 times (488 - 400 + 1).\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to '4', '8' appears 49 times (48 full decades + 1 in 481-488).\n   - **Tens place:** In each hundred, '8' appears 10 times. The incomplete set (401-488) adds 9 more (480-488), totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** '8' does not appear as the hundreds digit within 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488.\n\nI think the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately.\n\nFirst, the units place. For the units digit, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does each digit appear in the units place? Well, for every group of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, the number of times a specific digit appears in the units place is the total number of page numbers divided by 10, rounded down, plus one if the remainder is greater than or equal to the digit.\n\nWait, maybe a better way is to calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are and then see how many extra numbers are beyond that. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). Each complete group contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for the units digit, the number of 4's is 48 (from each group) plus 1 if the extra numbers include a 4. Looking at 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 4's = 48 + 1 = 49, 8's = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but hold on, 488 is included, so yes, 488 is page 488, so the units digit is 8, so that's correct. So units digit contributes 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, up to 9 for 90-99. Each digit appears 10 times in the tens place per hundred.\n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488).\n\nSo, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89). So, for each hundred, that's 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n\nSince there are 4 full hundreds, that's 4*10=40 4's and 4*10=40 8's in the tens place from the full hundreds.\n\nNow, we have the remaining 88 pages: 401-488. Let's look at the tens digit in these. The tens digit here cycles from 0 to 8. So, for each ten, the tens digit is 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), up to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? Well, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So, that's 10 numbers: 440, 441, ..., 449. So, 10 times. Similarly, how about 8 in the tens place? That would be 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, in the tens place for the remaining 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens digit 4's: 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 = 50.\n\nTotal tens digit 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, that seems right because in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (440-449), and 8 occurs 9 times (480-488). So, yes, 50 4's and 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When we have 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for each ten, 401-410: tens digit 0, 411-420: 1, ..., 480-488: 8. So, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, yes, 9 times. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers from 100 onwards. So, for 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, but since we're only considering page numbers, we don't print leading zeros, so the hundreds digit doesn't exist for pages 1-99. So, starting from page 100, the hundreds digit is 1, then 2, 3, 4 for pages 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 pages. So, 89 times.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit position.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate that. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 4's are more than 8's, but let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, let me recalculate:\n\nUnits place: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nTens place: 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\nHundreds place: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89.\n\n49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, for the partial hundred (401-488), I had 10 4's and 9 8's, which added to the 40 from the full hundreds, giving 50 4's and 49 8's. That seems correct.\n\nAnd in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, which is correct because from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I just want to make sure I didn't double-count or miss any numbers.\n\nLet me think about the units place again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nIt's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many terms are there in this sequence?\n\nThe first term is 4, the last term is 484. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place: 8,18,28,...,488. The last term is 488, so ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, that's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens digit, so 4 hundreds give 40, plus in the last partial hundred, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so total 50. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times per hundred, so 4 hundreds give 40, but in the last partial hundred, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 times, and 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So, 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nWait, but let me just think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by using a formula or another counting method to confirm.\n\nAnother approach: For each digit position, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nWe've already done that, but perhaps using a formula for each digit position.\n\nFor the units digit:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is floor(N/10) + (1 if N mod 10 >= d else 0).\n\nSimilarly, for the tens digit, it's floor(N/100) * 10 + something depending on the remainder.\n\nBut perhaps it's more complicated, and my initial approach was correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position and sum them up.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe I should check the total number of digits printed. Wait, but that's not necessary here since the problem is only about the count of 4's and 8's.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me recount the hundreds place. From 1 to 488, the hundreds digit is 1 from 100-199 (100 times), 2 from 200-299 (100 times), 3 from 300-399 (100 times), and 4 from 400-488 (89 times). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and 8 never appears there.\n\nIn the tens place, as calculated, 50 times for 4 and 49 times for 8.\n\nIn the units place, 49 each.\n\nSo, yes, 188 4's and 98 8's, difference is 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **4's:** Appear once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (48 full groups of 10 + 1 in the remaining 8 numbers).\n   - **8's:** Similarly, appear 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - **4's:** Each hundred contributes 10 4's, and in the last partial hundred (401-488), 440-449 adds 10 more, totaling 50.\n   - **8's:** Each hundred contributes 10 8's, but in the last partial hundred, only 480-488 adds 9, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **4's:** From 400-488, 4 appears 89 times.\n   - **8's:** Never appears, as the book ends at 488.\n\nSumming up:\n- **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488.\n\nI think I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and then do the same for the digit 8. Then, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. \n\nFirst, let's look at the units place. In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's 4; in 11-20, it's 14; and so on. Now, since the book has 488 pages, how many complete sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 complete sets of ten, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). \n\nSo, in each of the 48 complete sets, the units digit 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which adds one more 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for ten consecutive numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nIn each of the 4 complete hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49), so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for the numbers 440-449, which is another 10 times. So, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units: 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 484 adds one more, total 49. Tens: 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then 440-449 adds another 10, so 50. Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89. So 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems right.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nStarting with the units place again. Similar to 4's, in each set of ten, the units digit 8 appears once. So, 48 complete sets of ten, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 488 is included, which adds one more 8 in the units place. So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit is 8 for ten consecutive numbers in each hundred: 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, in each hundred, there are 10 occurrences. There are 4 complete hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. Wait, that's actually 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-489, but since 488 is the last page, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 times. So, tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Units: 48 complete sets, 48, plus 488 adds one, so 49. Tens: 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49. So total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. Hmm, but wait, is 480 included in the 401-488 range? Yes, because 480 is greater than 400, so it's in the 401-488 range. So, yes, 9 times.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49 for tens place. So, total 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, how many more 4's are there? 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts.\n\nFirst, 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in 481-488, 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place, so 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Tens place: 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in 401-488, 440-449 adds another 10, so 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 complete sets, 48, plus 488, so 49.\n\n- Tens place: 4 complete hundreds, 40, plus 480-488, which is 9, so 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but wait a second. When considering the tens place, from 1-400, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? It's 10 times per hundred, so 4 times 10 is 40. Then, from 401-488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total 49.\n\nWait, but 480 is part of the 401-488 range, correct. So, yes, 9 times.\n\nWait, but 480 is 4-8-0, so the tens digit is 8, correct. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, 9 times.\n\nSo, yes, 49.\n\nSo, 4's total 188, 8's total 98, difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, it's easy to miscount the last partial set. Let me verify the counts again.\n\nUnits place for 4's:\n\n- Each 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, from 1-480, that's 480 numbers, which is 48 sets of 10, so 48 times. Then, from 481-488, which is 8 numbers, 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place, so 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place for 4's:\n\n- Each 100 numbers, 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers. So, 1-100: 40-49, 10 times.\n\n101-200: 140-149, 10 times.\n\n201-300: 240-249, 10 times.\n\n301-400: 340-349, 10 times.\n\nSo, 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nThen, 401-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nSo, total 40 + 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place for 4's:\n\n- From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place:\n\n- Each 10 numbers, 8 appears once. So, 48 sets of 10, 48 times. Then, 488 adds one more, so 49.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each 100 numbers, 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers. So, 1-100: 80-89, 10 times.\n\n101-200: 180-189, 10 times.\n\n201-300: 280-289, 10 times.\n\n301-400: 380-389, 10 times.\n\nSo, 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nThen, 401-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nTotal tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check again. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, that's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, 9 times, correct.\n\nSo, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, yes, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I think about page numbers, sometimes the hundreds digit doesn't start until page 100, but I think I accounted for that correctly.\n\nWait, another way to check is to think about how many 4's and 8's appear in each digit position separately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a formula or a more systematic approach.\n\nFor any digit position (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times a digit d appears can be calculated by considering higher digits, current digit, and lower digits.\n\nBut maybe that's overcomplicating it for now. Since the book is only 488 pages, maybe manual counting as I did is sufficient.\n\nWait, let me try another approach for the units place. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to n is given by:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: floor(n / 10) * 1.\n\nPlus, if the remainder is >= d, add 1. But if d is 0, it's a bit different.\n\nWait, but in our case, d is 4 and 8, which are non-zero.\n\nSo, for units place:\n\nFor 4's: floor(488 / 10) = 48, so 48 times. Then, check if 488 mod 10 >= 4. 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so add 1. So, total 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's: floor(488 / 10) = 48, so 48 times. Then, 488 mod 10 is 8, which is equal to 8, so add 1. Total 49.\n\nThat matches what I found earlier.\n\nFor the tens place, the formula is a bit more involved.\n\nThe number of times digit d appears in the tens place up to n is:\n\nhigher = n / 100\n\ncurrent = (n / 10) % 10\n\nlower = n % 10\n\ncount = higher * 10\n\nif current > d, count += 10\n\nif current == d, count += lower + 1\n\nBut wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, the formula is:\n\nFor the tens place:\n\ncount = (higher) * 10\n\nif current > d, count += 10\n\nif current == d, count += (lower + 1)\n\nSo, for d = 4:\n\nhigher = 488 / 100 = 4 (integer division)\n\ncurrent = (488 / 10) % 10 = 48 % 10 = 8\n\nlower = 488 % 10 = 8\n\nSo, count = 4 * 10 = 40\n\nSince current (8) > d (4), we add 10, so 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but that's not matching my earlier count. Earlier, I had 50 for 4's in the tens place, which is correct.\n\nWait, but in the manual count, I had 40 from the first four hundreds and 10 from 440-449, totaling 50. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for d = 8 in the tens place:\n\nhigher = 4\n\ncurrent = 8\n\nlower = 8\n\ncount = 4 * 10 = 40\n\nSince current (8) == d (8), we add lower + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nSo, total count = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWhich matches my earlier count.\n\nFor the hundreds place, digit d appears in the hundreds place for numbers from d*100 to (d+1)*100 -1, but only if (d+1)*100 -1 <= n.\n\nSo, for d=4:\n\nStarts at 400, ends at 499. But our n is 488, so from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 times.\n\nFor d=8:\n\nStarts at 800, which is beyond 488, so 0 times.\n\nSo, that matches.\n\nThus, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm going to check once more to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, let me list out the counts again:\n\n4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n\n- Tens: 50\n\n- Hundreds: 89\n\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n\n- Tens: 49\n\n- Hundreds: 0\n\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI think the best way to approach this is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles through 0 to 9. So, for the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once every 10 numbers. Now, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). \n\nIn each of these 48 groups, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so the digit 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. So, total 4's in the units place: 48.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, each group of 10 has one 8, so that's also 48 times. But in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once (at 488). So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me check again. From 1 to 480, there are 48 groups of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1 to 8, so 8 appears once at 488. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place gives us 48 fours and 49 eights. So, 4's are actually one less than 8's in the units place. Hmm, but I'm supposed to find how many more 4's than 8's, so maybe the tens place will make up for it.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers. \n\nSince the book has 488 pages, let's see how many complete hundreds there are. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages left (401-488).\n\nIn each of these 4 hundreds, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49 in the first hundred, 140-149 in the second, etc.). So, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times for the digit 4 in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), so that's also 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, looking at the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? From 440-449, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480 is included and 488 is the end, so that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8.\n\nSo, in the remaining 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in the tens place: 40 (from the complete hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50.\n\nTotal 8's in the tens place: 40 (from the complete hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 49. So, 4's are one more than 8's here.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards, up to 488. So, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nFor the digit 4 in the hundreds place, it appears from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nFor the digit 8 in the hundreds place, it would appear from 800 onwards, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the digit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in the hundreds place: 89.\n\nTotal 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, subtract the total 8's from the total 4's to find how many more 4's there are: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 48 fours and 49 eights. In the tens place, 50 fours and 49 eights. In the hundreds place, 89 fours and 0 eights.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for the remaining 88 pages. From 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 4, that's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 fours in the tens place. For the eights, it's from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So that seems correct.\n\nIn the units place, from 1-480, 48 eights, and then 488 adds one more, making it 49. So, that's correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours, and no eights. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 187, and the total number of 8's is 98. The difference is 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 and one 8.\n   - Remaining 8 numbers (481-488): 4 doesn't appear; 8 appears once.\n   - Total 4's: 48\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - 488 \u00f7 100 = 4.88 \u2192 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's.\n   - Remaining 88 numbers (401-488): 4 appears 10 times (440-449); 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 4\u00d710 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears from 400-488 (89 times).\n   - 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers can be 1-digit (1-9), 2-digit (10-99), or 3-digit (100-488).\n\nI think the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4. I'll check each position one by one.\n\nFirst, the units place. For the units digit, the 4 can appear in every set of 10 numbers. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such numbers are there?\n\nWell, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (sets of 10) in 488. Let me calculate that.\n\n488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete decades and then 8 extra numbers. So, in each decade, the units digit is 4 once. So, that's 48 times. But wait, in the 489th number, which would be 488, the units digit is 8, so the 48th decade ends at 480. So, from 1 to 480, the units digit 4 appears 48 times. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit 4 doesn't appear again. So, total units place 4's: 48.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks is 10 numbers long, and the tens digit is 4 in each.\n\nLet me count how many such blocks there are. From 1 to 488, how many times does the tens digit cycle through 0-9?\n\nEach hundred has 10 tens digits (0-9), so for 488 pages, we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). So, for each hundred, that's 10 occurrences. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nNow, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10.\n\nWait, but 488 is less than 500, so 440-449 is within 401-488. So, that's 10 more. So total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is another 10. So, 40+10=50. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in this range, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers. So, that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400 is included, so 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, yes, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98; 98+89=187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, the units digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\n488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit is 8 in 488. So, that's one more occurrence. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488 (since 480-489 would be the next set, but we only go up to 488). So, let's count these.\n\nEach hundred has a block where the tens digit is 8, which is 10 numbers. So, from 1-400, how many such blocks are there?\n\nIn each hundred, 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, for 4 hundreds (1-400), that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 4*10=40.\n\nThen, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers here.\n\nWait, but 480-489 would be the next block, but we only go up to 488, so it's 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 401-488) = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the hundreds place has 0 occurrences of 8.\n\nTherefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nWait, that's 98 times the digit 8 appears.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, units place: 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, and then 488 adds another one, so 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the hundreds place had 0, so total 98.\n\nWait, but earlier for 4's, I had 187, and for 8's, 98. So, the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's:\n\nUnits place: 48 times.\n\nTens place: 50 times.\n\nHundreds place: 89 times.\n\nTotal: 48+50=98; 98+89=187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49 times.\n\nTens place: 49 times.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89. So, 49 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with hundreds digit 4. So, 89 times. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure about the tens place for 4's. I had 50 times.\n\nFrom 1-400, each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40+10=50. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, from 1-400, 4*10=40, and then 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 40+9=49.\n\nUnits place for 8's: 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, and then 488 adds another, so 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if I counted correctly in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems right.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the units place for 4's. From 1-488, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full times, and then in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit 4 doesn't appear again. So, 48 times. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for units place of 8's: 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, and then in 488, another 8, so 49 times.\n\nWait, but in the tens place for 4's, I had 50, which is 40 from 1-400 and 10 from 440-449. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check: 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place for 8's, from 1-400, it's 4*10=40, and then 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 187, 8's:98, difference:89.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that I double-counted or missed something?\n\nWait, in the hundreds place for 4's, it's only from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4's, it's 40 from 1-400, and 10 from 440-449, so 50.\n\nUnits place:48.\n\nYes, that adds up to 187.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTens place:40 from 1-400, and 9 from 480-488, so 49.\n\nUnits place:49.\n\nTotal 98.\n\nSo, 187-98=89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be different, but maybe it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check again.\n\nFrom 1-400, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. So, that's 4 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 more.\n\nSo, 40+9=49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, units place for 8's: 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, and then 488 adds another, so 49.\n\nSo, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 187-98=89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in different positions, it's easy to make off-by-one errors.\n\nLet me try another approach: for each digit position, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFor units digit, the number of times 4 appears is floor(488/10)=48, with a remainder of 8, but since 4 is less than the remainder, we don't add 1. Wait, actually, the formula is:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is floor(n/10) + (1 if d <= (n mod 10) else 0).\n\nWait, so for 4 in units place:\n\nfloor(488/10)=48, and since 4 <= (488 mod 10)=8, we add 1. So, 48+1=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, that's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The formula is:\n\nFor units digit, the number of times digit d appears from 1 to n is:\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor each i from 1 to n:\n\nif i mod 10 == d, count +=1\n\nBut another way is:\n\ncount = floor(n/10) * 1 + (1 if d <= (n mod 10) else 0)\n\nWait, so for 4 in units place from 1 to 488:\n\nfloor(488/10)=48, and since 4 <= 8, add 1, so 48+1=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 48. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let's take a smaller example. Suppose n=14.\n\nHow many times does 4 appear in units place from 1-14?\n\nNumbers:4,14. So, 2 times.\n\nUsing the formula: floor(14/10)=1, and 4<=4, so 1+1=2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=13.\n\nNumbers with units digit 4:4 only. So, 1 time.\n\nFormula: floor(13/10)=1, 4>3, so 1+0=1. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, n=18:\n\nUnits digit 4:4,14. So, 2 times.\n\nfloor(18/10)=1, 4<=8, so 1+1=2. Correct.\n\nSo, for n=488, units digit 4: floor(488/10)=48, and 4<=8, so 48+1=49.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 48, but according to this formula, it's 49. So, I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nSimilarly, for units digit 8:\n\nfloor(488/10)=48, and 8<=8, so 48+1=49.\n\nSo, units digit 8 appears 49 times.\n\nWait, so that changes things. So, earlier, I had units digit 4 as 48, but it's actually 49.\n\nWait, let me recount.\n\nSo, for units digit 4:\n\nFrom 1-488, the units digit 4 appears in 4,14,24,...,484. How many numbers is that?\n\n488/10=48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4, and then in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit 4 appears in 484. So, that's one more. So, total 48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, units digit 8 appears in 8,18,...,488. So, 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, and then 488 is included, so 48+1=49.\n\nSo, earlier, I had units digit 4 as 48, but it's actually 49. That changes the total count for 4's.\n\nSo, let's recalculate the total number of 4's.\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:50\n\nHundreds place:89\n\nTotal:49+50=99; 99+89=188.\n\nWait, so 4's:188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:49\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nSo, difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because earlier I thought units digit 4 was 48, but according to the formula, it's 49. So, I must have made a mistake in my initial count.\n\nLet me verify with a smaller number. Suppose n=44.\n\nHow many times does 4 appear in units place from 1-44?\n\nNumbers:4,14,24,34,44. So, 5 times.\n\nUsing the formula: floor(44/10)=4, and 4<=4, so 4+1=5. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for n=49:\n\nUnits digit 4:4,14,24,34,44. So, 5 times.\n\nfloor(49/10)=4, 4<=9, so 4+1=5. Correct.\n\nSo, for n=488, units digit 4: floor(488/10)=48, 4<=8, so 48+1=49.\n\nSo, I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought it was 48. It's actually 49.\n\nTherefore, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so the difference is 90.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 89, but that was because I had units digit 4 as 48, which was incorrect.\n\nSo, the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, let me make sure.\n\nWait, in the units place, 4's:49, 8's:49.\n\nTens place, 4's:50, 8's:49.\n\nHundreds place, 4's:89, 8's:0.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 4's again. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40+10=50. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place for 8's, from 1-400, 4*10=40, and in 401-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 40+9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 90.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** Every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades (480 numbers), contributing 48 occurrences. The last 8 numbers (481-488) include 484, adding 1 more. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** Each hundred contains 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49). For 4 hundreds (1-400), that's 40. From 401-488, 440-449 adds 10. Total: 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** Pages 400-488 have 89 numbers with 4 in the hundreds place. Total: 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers contribute one 8. From 1-488, 48 full decades plus 488 adds one more. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** Each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 8. For 4 hundreds, that's 40. From 401-488, 480-488 adds 9. Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place. Total: 0.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of 8's from 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number is a three-digit number, right? Wait, actually, no, because page 1 is just '1', page 10 is '10', and so on up to page 488. So, the page numbers can be one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit numbers. \n\nI think the best approach is to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. For each place, I'll calculate how many times the digit 4 appears and how many times 8 appears. Then, I'll sum them up for each digit and find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block, the digit 4 appears once (like 4, 14, 24, etc.) and the digit 8 appears once (8, 18, 28, etc.). \n\nHow many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra pages (481 to 488). In each complete block, we have one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 * 1 = 48, and the same for 8's. Now, looking at the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, the digit 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). Therefore, the total for units place is 48 + 1 = 49 for 4's and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8's. Wait, that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49. Hmm, but wait, 488 is included, so yes, that's correct.\n\nMoving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit goes through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89). \n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4 hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40 times. Similarly, 8's in the tens place would also be 4 * 10 = 40 times. \n\nNow, looking at the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. \n\nIn 401-410, the tens digit is 0. So, no 4 or 8 here. \nIn 411-420, tens digit is 1. \n... \nIn 441-450, the tens digit is 4, so that's 10 times. \nSimilarly, in 481-490, the tens digit would be 8, but since we only go up to 488, it's only 8 times (480-488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480, 481,...,488, which is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. Wait, no, 480 is part of the 480-489 range, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. But actually, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, so in 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. But wait, 480 is included, so that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Hmm, but let me check: 480 is 480, so tens digit is 8, and 481-488 have tens digit 8 as well. So that's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, from 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449, but wait, 401-488: 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 times. And 480-488 is 9 times for 8's.\n\nWait, but 480 is part of 480-488, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, in the remaining 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total for tens place: 4's = 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 = 50. 8's = 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers 100 and above. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's 0. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, 200-299 it's 2, 300-399 it's 3, and 400-488 it's 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, summing up the hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0.\n\nNow, let's total up all the digits for each place.\n\nUnits place:\n4's: 49\n8's: 49\n\nTens place:\n4's: 50\n8's: 49\n\nHundreds place:\n4's: 89\n8's: 0\n\nAdding them all together:\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place: 488 pages. For each 10 pages, 1 four and 1 eight in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1 four and 1 eight, so 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units: 48 +1=49 for 4's and 48 +1=49 for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) give 4*10=40 for each. Then, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, in the tens place, how many fours? 440-449: that's 10 pages, so 10 fours. And how many eights? 480-488: that's 9 pages, so 9 eights. So, tens place: 40 +10=50 fours, and 40 +9=49 eights. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 fours. No eights in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\nAdding up: 49 +50 +89 = 188 fours. 49 +49 +0=98 eights. Difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I thought about the tens place in 401-488, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, but actually, 480 is the first page in that range, so 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. That seems right.\n\nAnother way to check: Let's calculate the total number of digits printed. Wait, maybe that's overcomplicating, but perhaps I can check if the counts make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nWait, another approach: For each digit position, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\nNumber of times 4 appears: floor(488/10) = 48 full cycles, each contributing 1 four, plus in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), 4 appears once. So, 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears 48 +1=49 times in units place.\n\nTens place:\nNumber of times 4 appears: floor(488/100) = 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The number of times 4 appears in the tens place is the number of times the tens digit is 4 in 401-488. That's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So total 40 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place: 4*10=40 from the full hundreds, and in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\nNumber of times 4 appears: The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours.\n\nNumber of times 8 appears: Since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so 0.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each 10 consecutive numbers contribute one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks of 10 in 488 pages, contributing 48 each.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each 100 consecutive numbers contribute 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place.\n   - There are 4 complete hundreds, contributing 40 each.\n   - The remaining 88 pages (401-488) add 10 fours (440-449) and 9 eights (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, contributing 89 fours.\n   - No eights appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89.\n   - Total 8's: 0.\n\n**Summing Up:**\n- Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- Total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Each page number is a three-digit number, right? Because the book goes up to 488, so the page numbers range from 1 to 488. \n\nWait, actually, page 1 is just one digit, but maybe it's easier to think of all page numbers as three-digit numbers by padding with leading zeros. So, page 1 would be 001, page 10 would be 010, and so on. That way, I can analyze each digit place separately\u2014units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nLet me consider each digit place one by one. I'll start with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in a sequence of numbers, except maybe the last few if the total number isn't a multiple of 10. But since 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, the units digits from 0 to 9 will each appear 48 times, and then the digits 1 to 8 will appear one more time. Wait, no, actually, when you have 488 pages, the units digit cycles every 10 pages. So for each complete set of 10 pages, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. \n\nSo, the number of complete sets of 10 in 488 pages is 48 full sets (since 48*10=480), and then there are 8 extra pages (481 to 488). So, in the units place, each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times, and then digits 1-8 appear one more time each. So, the digit 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place, and the digit 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times as well. So, in the units place, the count for both 4 and 8 is equal.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each block of 100 pages. So, for 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? Well, 400 pages would be 4 complete hundreds, and then 88 pages remaining. \n\nIn each complete hundred (like 0-99, 100-199, etc.), the tens digit cycles from 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 400 pages, that's 4*10 = 40 times each digit in the tens place. Now, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). Wait, let's see: pages 401-409 have tens digit 0, 410-419 have 1, up to 480-488 having tens digit 8. So, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place in these 88 pages?\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 480-488). So, each digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times, except for 8, which appears 9 times because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481,...,488). Wait, no, actually, 401-410 is 10 numbers (401 to 410), so the tens digit is 0 for 10 pages. Similarly, 410-419 is another 10 pages with tens digit 1, and so on up to 470-479, which is 10 pages with tens digit 7. Then, 480-488 is 9 pages, so tens digit 8 appears 9 times. \n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 pages, right? So, in the tens place, digits 0-7 each appear 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times. So, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit counts are: 0-7: 10 each, 8: 9. So, adding this to the 400 pages, which had 4*10=40 each for digits 0-9, the total for each digit in the tens place would be:\n\nFor digits 0-7: 40 + 10 = 50 each.\n\nFor digit 8: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nFor digit 9: 40 + 0 = 40, since there's no 9 in the tens place beyond 488.\n\nWait, but wait, in the 400 pages, the tens digits go up to 9 in the 300s and 400s. Wait, no, 400-499 would have tens digits up to 9, but since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit in 400-488 only goes up to 8. So, for the 400-488 range, the tens digits are 0-8, and 9 doesn't appear in the tens place beyond 488. So, for the tens place overall, digits 0-8 appear 40 (from 0-399) plus their respective counts in 400-488. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it differently. The total number of times each digit appears in the tens place can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor each hundred (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, each digit appears 10 times per hundred. Since there are 4 full hundreds (0-399), that's 4*10=40 times each for digits 0-9 in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the remaining pages from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). Wait, no, 400-488 is 89 pages, but the tens digit in these pages is from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, each tens digit from 0-8 appears how many times?\n\nFrom 400-409: tens digit 0, 10 pages.\n\n410-419: 1, 10 pages.\n\n...\n\n470-479: 7, 10 pages.\n\n480-488: 8, 9 pages.\n\nSo, digits 0-7 appear 10 times each, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total for tens place:\n\nDigits 0-7: 40 (from 0-399) + 10 = 50 each.\n\nDigit 8: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nDigits 9: 40 (since in 0-399, 9 appears 10 times per hundred, but in 400-488, 9 doesn't appear in the tens place).\n\nWait, but 400-488 doesn't include any 9 in the tens place, so digit 9 in the tens place only appears 40 times (from 0-399). So, for the tens place, digit 4 appears 50 times, and digit 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place?\n\n- Digit 0: appears 99 times (pages 1-99). Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, but each page number is technically a three-digit number, so 001-099. So, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, which is 99 pages. So, digit 0 appears 99 times in the hundreds place.\n\n- Digit 1: 100-199, which is 100 pages, so digit 1 appears 100 times.\n\n- Digit 2: 200-299, 100 pages, so 100 times.\n\n- Digit 3: 300-399, 100 pages, so 100 times.\n\n- Digit 4: 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nDigits 5-9: don't appear in the hundreds place at all because the book only goes up to 488.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, digit 4 appears 89 times, and digit 8 doesn't appear at all (since the hundreds digit is 4 for 400-488, and 8 would require pages 800-899, which don't exist here).\n\nNow, let me summarize the counts:\n\nFor each digit, I'll sum up their occurrences in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49 times (from earlier calculation).\n\n- Tens place: 50 times.\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 times.\n\nTotal for 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nNow, for digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times.\n\n- Tens place: 49 times.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nTotal for 8: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nWait, let me double-check the hundreds place for 4. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nNow, digit 8 in the hundreds place: since the highest page is 488, there's no page 800, so 0 times. Correct.\n\nSo, total counts:\n\n4: 188\n\n8: 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, units place: I had 48 full tens, each contributing 1 occurrence of 4 and 8, and then 8 extra pages (481-488), so digits 1-8 each get an extra occurrence. So, 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8 in units place. Correct.\n\nTens place: 400 pages contribute 40 times each for digits 0-9 in the tens place. Then, 400-488: 89 pages, with tens digits 0-8. So, digits 0-7 appear 10 times each, and 8 appears 9 times. So, for digit 4 in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. Correct. For digit 8 in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: digit 4 appears 89 times, digit 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me think again. Did I count correctly in the hundreds place?\n\nWait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so 89 times. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the tens place. Let me recount the tens place for digit 8.\n\nIn the tens place, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. So, in the tens place, digit 8 appears 40 (from 0-399) + 9 = 49 times. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, digit 4 in the tens place: from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, 10 times. So, 40 (from 0-399) + 10 = 50. Correct.\n\nWait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 pages, so digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in that range, plus the 40 from earlier. Correct.\n\nSo, the total for 4 is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nFor 8, it's 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a large number. Let me check another approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\n- Units place: For every 10 pages, there's one 4. So, 488 / 10 = 48 full cycles, plus 8 extra pages. So, 48*1 = 48, plus one more if the extra pages include a 4. The extra pages are 481-488, which includes 484, so +1. So, 49.\n\n- Tens place: For every 100 pages, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 488 / 100 = 4 full cycles, contributing 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (400-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\n- Units place: Same as 4's, 49.\n\n- Tens place: In the remaining 88 pages (400-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 40 (from full cycles) + 9 = 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think if I missed something. For example, in the hundreds place, is digit 4 appearing 89 times? Yes, because from 400 to 488 is 89 pages, each with hundreds digit 4.\n\nIn the tens place, digit 4 appears 50 times, which includes 40 from the full hundreds and 10 from 440-449.\n\nIn the units place, 49 times.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Each page number is a three-digit number if we consider up to page 99, but wait, 488 is a three-digit number, so actually, all pages from 1 to 488 are three-digit numbers, except maybe the first few? No, wait, page 1 is just one digit, but as the pages go up, they become two-digit and then three-digit numbers. So maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nLet me think: to count how many times the digit 4 appears, I need to look at each digit place in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and count the number of 4's in each place. Similarly, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same for 8. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times plus one more if 484 is included. Wait, 484 is within the 481-488 range, so that's one more 4. So total 48 + 1 = 49 times for 4 in units place. Similarly, for 8 in the units place: in each set of 10, 8 appears once, so 48 times, plus in the extra 8 numbers, 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So 48 + 1 = 49 times for 8 in units place.\n\nWait, but wait: page numbers start at 1, so page 1 is 1, page 2 is 2, up to page 10, which is 10. So, in the first 10 pages, the units digit goes from 1 to 0 (page 10). So, in page 10, the units digit is 0, not 10. So, maybe I should adjust my calculation. Wait, actually, when counting the number of times a digit appears in the units place, it's the same as the number of complete tens and then the remainder. So, for 488 pages, the number of times a digit appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete tens, which is 48 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8), and then the remainder is 8, so in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times, and then the digits from 1 to 8 appear one more time in the units place of the last partial set. Wait, but page numbers start at 1, so page 1 is 1, page 2 is 2, up to page 488. So, in the units place, from 1 to 488, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally except for the last partial set.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each place separately.\n\nLet's start with the units place:\n\nFor the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once every 10 numbers. So, in 488 numbers, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times in the units place, and then in the last 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits are 1 through 8. So, for the digit 4, it appears once in each set of 10, so 48 times, plus one more in the last 8 numbers (since 484 is within 481-488). So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 times for 4. Similarly, for 8, it appears 48 times in the units place, plus one more in the last 8 numbers (488), so 48 + 1 = 49 times for 8.\n\nWait, but wait: page 488 is included, so units digit 8 appears once more. So, units place: 4 appears 49 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each set of 100 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 (since 4*100=400), with 88 remaining. So, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 4 times in the tens place for each hundred, so 4*10 = 40 times for each digit. Wait, no: in each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10=40 times each digit. Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (from 401 to 488), how does the tens digit behave?\n\nFrom 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490, but we only go up to 488). Wait, actually, from 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles through 0 to 8. Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times in each hundred, but since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit 8 appears from 480 to 488, which is 9 times (480-488 inclusive). Wait, but 480 is included in the 401-488 range, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, for the tens place:\n\n- For digits 0-7: each appears 10 times in the first 400 pages, and then in the remaining 88 pages, each of these digits appears 10 times as well? Wait, no, because in 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times do they appear in the tens place?\n\nWait, maybe a better way is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in the tens place from 1 to 488.\n\nIn the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times for each hundred. So, for 4 complete hundreds (1-400), each digit appears 4*10=40 times in the tens place. Now, from 401 to 488, that's 88 numbers. The tens digit in this range starts at 0 (401-410), then 1 (411-420), up to 8 (481-490, but we stop at 488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear in the tens place?\n\n- Tens digit 0: 401-410: 10 numbers, but 401 is included, so 10 times.\n- Tens digit 1: 411-420: 10 numbers.\n- Similarly up to tens digit 7: 471-480: 10 numbers.\n- Tens digit 8: 481-490, but we only go up to 488, so 481-488: 8 numbers.\n\nWait, but 481-488 is 8 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 8 times.\n\nWait, but wait: 480 is included in the 401-488 range, right? 480 is 480, which is in 401-488. So, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 times.\n\nWait, but 480 is 480, which is in the range 401-488, so yes, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the 401-488 range.\n\nSo, for the tens place:\n\n- Digits 0-7: each appears 10 times in the 401-488 range, so total in the tens place from 1-488 is 40 (from 1-400) + 10 = 50 times each.\n- Digit 8: appears 9 times in the 401-488 range, so total is 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but wait: in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, total for digit 8 in tens place is 40 (from 1-400) + 9 = 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 4 in the tens place:\n\nIn 1-400, digit 4 appears 40 times in the tens place (as each hundred has 10 times, 4 hundreds). In the 401-488 range, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, total for digit 4 in tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 times.\n\nWait, but wait: 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that's 10 numbers. So, digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in 401-488, so total 50 times.\n\nSimilarly, digit 8 in tens place: 40 times in 1-400, and 9 times in 401-488, so 49 times.\n\nSo, for the tens place:\n\n- 4 appears 50 times\n- 8 appears 49 times\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, each digit from 1 to 4 appears in the hundreds place for 100 numbers each. So, digit 1 appears from 100-199, digit 2 from 200-299, digit 3 from 300-399, and digit 4 from 400-488. So, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place?\n\n- Digit 1: 100-199: 100 numbers, so 100 times.\n- Digit 2: 200-299: 100 times.\n- Digit 3: 300-399: 100 times.\n- Digit 4: 400-488: 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Wait, 400 to 488 inclusive is 89 numbers, so digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nDigits 0,5-9 don't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488.\n\nSo, for the hundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times\n- 8 appears 0 times, since 800-899 isn't part of the book.\n\nWait, but wait: 8 in the hundreds place would be pages 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the total number of times 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nFor 4:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, but let me double-check these calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- 488 pages, so 488 / 10 = 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, total 4's in units: 48 + 1 = 49, 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- From 1-400: each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place (4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times per digit). So, 40 times each for 4 and 8.\n\nFrom 401-488:\n\n- Tens digit cycles through 0-8. Each digit from 0-7 appears 10 times, and digit 8 appears 9 times (from 480-488). So, for 4 in the tens place, from 401-488, it's 10 times (440-449). So, total 40 + 10 = 50 for 4.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place, it's 9 times in 401-488, so total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times (from 400-488), 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place, from 401-488, 440-449 is 10 pages, so 10 times for 4 in the tens place. So, 40 + 10 = 50. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nUnits place seems correct too.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the difference would be higher, but maybe not. Let me check again.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is to count the number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the tens place for 4. Let me think: from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times in 401-488, and 40 times in 1-400, so 50 total. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, which is correct.\n\nFor 8's, in the tens place, it's 9 times in 401-488, plus 40 times in 1-400, so 49 total. Units place: 49 each. So, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in different places, it's easy to make an off-by-one error. Let me try another approach to verify.\n\nAnother approach is to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately, then sum them up.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nUnits place: For every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 484, which has a 4 in the units place, so +1. Total: 49.\n\nTens place: For every 100 numbers, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 488 / 100 = 4 full groups, each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so +10. Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\nUnits place: Same as 4's, 48 full groups, 48, plus 488, so +1. Total: 49.\n\nTens place: For every 100 numbers, each digit appears 10 times. So, 4 full groups, 4*10=40. In the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, +9. Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something else. When counting the units place, I included 484 as an extra 4, but does page 484 exist? Yes, because the book has 488 pages, so 484 is within that range. Similarly, 488 is the last page, so that's included.\n\nAnother check: total number of digits printed. From 1 to 488, the number of digits can be calculated, but that's maybe more than necessary. Alternatively, maybe I can check the total number of 4's and 8's in another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nUnits place: 4 appears once every 10 numbers, so 48 times, plus 484, so 49.\n\nSame for 8's: units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds 0.\n\nSo, 188 vs 98, difference of 90.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears is calculated by considering each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately. Similarly, the digit 8 is counted in each place. \n\n- **Units place**: Each digit appears 48 times in 488 numbers, plus one more for 484 and 488, totaling 49 for both 4 and 8.\n- **Tens place**: 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place**: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSumming these:\n- Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- Total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nThe difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"
