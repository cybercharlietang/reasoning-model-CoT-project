    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488.\n\nI guess I'll start by looking at how often the digit 4 appears in each position: units, tens, and hundreds. Similarly, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Then, I'll compare the total counts of 4's and 8's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4. I'll consider each position separately.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place.\n   - For example, in 1-10: 4; 11-20: 14; and so on.\n   - Now, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 pages.\n   - In each complete block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times.\n   - In the partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once here as well (page 484).\n   - So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 100 pages. Each digit appears 10 times in each block of 100.\n   - For example, in 1-100: 40-49 have the tens digit as 4, which is 10 times.\n   - So, how many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete blocks.\n   - Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - Now, the remaining pages are from 401 to 488. Let's see how many 4's are in the tens place here.\n   - The tens digit in 401-409 is 0, and from 410-419 it's 1, and so on. Wait, actually, in 400-499, the tens digit is 0 in 400-409, 1 in 410-419, etc.\n   - But since we're only going up to 488, let's see: from 400-488, the tens digit is 0 for 400-409, 1 for 410-419, up to 8 for 480-488.\n   - The digit 4 in the tens place would occur in 440-449. So, how many pages is that? From 440 to 449, that's 10 pages. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488. So that's 10 more 4's in the tens place.\n   - Wait, but earlier I thought 4 complete blocks of 100 would give 40, and then the partial block adds 10, making it 50. But wait, 400-499 is actually part of the 5th block, right? So maybe I need to adjust my counting.\n\nWait, let me correct this. The first block is 1-100, the second 101-200, the third 201-300, the fourth 301-400, and the fifth would be 401-500. But since our book ends at 488, the fifth block is only up to 488.\n\nSo, in each of the first four blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each has 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nIn the fifth block (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The digit 4 in the tens place occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 more 4's in the tens place.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400 to 488. So, how many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages.\n   - So, each of these pages has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's.\n\nWait, but wait, 400 to 488 is 89 pages, right? Because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89.\n\nSo, total 4's in the hundreds place: 89.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Because from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4, which is correct, so that's 89 4's. But in the units and tens places, I might have overcounted.\n\nWait, let me go back.\n\nWait, when counting the hundreds place, I considered 400-488 as 89 pages, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, from 1-488, each hundred block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, except the last block which only goes up to 488. So, 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the 401-488 block, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, 40 +10=50. That seems correct.\n\nIn the units place, each 10 pages contribute one 4, so 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus the remaining 8 pages (481-488) which include 484, so that's one more, making 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, in each block of 10, the digit 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - Number of complete blocks of 10 in 488: 48, each contributing one 8, so 48.\n   - The partial block is 481-488, which has 8 in the units place at 488. So, that's one more.\n   - So, total 8's in units place: 48 +1=49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In each block of 100, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n   - Number of complete blocks of 100: 4, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n   - Now, in the partial block 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8.\n   - The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 8's in the tens place.\n   - So, total 8's in tens place: 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's correct.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n   - So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, for the 4's in the hundreds place, I had 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's in the tens place, I had 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 8's. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. For 4's, I had 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus 484, which is one more, making 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, units place: 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus 488, which is one more, making 49. Correct.\n\nTens place for 4's: 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10, so 40, plus 440-449, which is 10, making 50. Correct.\n\nTens place for 8's: 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10, so 40, plus 480-488, which is 9, making 49. Correct.\n\nSo, 4's total: 49+50+89=188.\n\n8's total:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but wait a minute, 488 is the last page, so in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 pages, correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the 4's in the tens place. From 440-449, that's 10 pages, but 449 is within 488, so that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 pages, correct.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the number of times the digits 4 and 8 appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** In every block of 10 pages, 4 appears once. There are 48 full blocks (480 pages) and 8 extra pages (481-488). In the full blocks, 4 appears 48 times. In the extra pages, 4 appears once (page 484). Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens place:** In every block of 100 pages, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. There are 4 full blocks (400 pages), contributing 40 times. In the partial block (401-488), 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. Total: 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 pages. There are 48 full blocks and 8 extra pages. In the extra pages, 8 appears once (page 488). Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens place:** In every block of 100 pages, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. There are 4 full blocks, contributing 40 times. In the partial block, 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No pages have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488). Total: 0.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number is a three-digit number, right? Well, actually, from 1 to 488, the page numbers can be one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit numbers. So maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nLet me start by thinking about the units place. For every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears once. So, for the units place, the number of 4's and 8's should be the same. But wait, I need to check if that holds true all the way up to 488. \n\nSo, let me calculate how many complete sets of ten there are in 488 pages. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten and then 8 more pages. In each complete set, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for the units place, 4 appears 48 times and 8 appears 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (page 484), and the digit 8 appears once in the units place (page 488). So, adding those, in the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, in the units place, they're equal.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. In the tens place, the digits cycle every 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. Wait, actually, from 1 to 100, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each, but starting from 10-19, 20-29, etc. So, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. So, for the digit 4, it appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 pages, and similarly, 8 appears 10 times every 100 pages. \n\nNow, how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and the same for 8 (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for 4 complete hundreds, the digit 4 appears 4 * 10 = 40 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 4 * 10 = 40 times. \n\nNow, let's check the remaining 88 pages (401-488). The tens digit in these pages ranges from 0 to 8. So, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. From 401-409, the tens digit is 0. From 410-419, it's 1; 420-429, it's 2; 430-439, it's 3; 440-449, it's 4; 450-459, it's 5; 460-469, it's 6; 470-479, it's 7; and 480-488, it's 8. \n\nSo, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 pages, but wait, our range is only up to 488, so 440-449 is within 401-488. So, 440-449 is 10 pages, so the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 pages (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 pages because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). Wait, actually, 480-489 would be 10 pages, but we only go up to 488, so it's 9 pages. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the remaining 88 pages.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times in the last partial hundred. So, adding that to the previous counts, the total for the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. That means there's one more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. The first 400 pages have 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times for 4 and 8 in the tens place, so 40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. For 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. From page 1 to 99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's 0. From page 100 to 199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4. \n\nSo, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488. How many times is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. \n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit cycles through 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., but 8 would appear in the hundreds place starting at 800. But since our book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the digit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. That's a significant difference.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's are printed than 8's, we subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's.\n\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the units place: 488 pages. Each 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. 48 complete sets of 10, so 48 each, plus the last 8 pages (481-488), which include 484 (units digit 4) and 488 (units digit 8). So, units digits: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: 4 complete hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place. So, 40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449 (10 times) and 8 for 480-488 (9 times). So, total tens place: 50 for 4 and 49 for 8. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 pages, so 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place, so 0. Correct.\n\nAdding up: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 for 4, and 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 for 8. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit surprised that the hundreds place contributes so many more 4's. Let me think again. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, yes, 89 times. So, that's a big chunk.\n\nIs there any other place where 8 could appear that I might have missed? For example, in the hundreds place, but as we saw, 8 doesn't appear because the book only goes up to 488. So, 800-899 would be needed for 8 in the hundreds place, which isn't the case here.\n\nAlso, in the tens place, from 480-488, that's 9 pages, so 9 times for 8 in the tens place. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times for 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's a lot more than the other digits.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. For 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. 188 - 98 = 90. Yes, that seems right.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires comparing the number of times the digits 4 and 8 appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n1. **Units Place Analysis**:\n   - Each set of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488 pages, contributing 48 each.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one more 4 and one more 8.\n   - Total: 49 each.\n\n2. **Tens Place Analysis**:\n   - Each set of 100 pages contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - Four complete hundreds contribute 40 each.\n   - The remaining 88 pages (401-488) contribute 10 4's and 9 8's.\n   - Total: 50 for 4, 49 for 8.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place Analysis**:\n   - Pages 400-488 contribute 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n   - No 8's appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nSumming up:\n- Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- Total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 all the way up to 488.\n\nI guess the best way to approach this is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll handle each digit place for both 4 and 8 and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. Units place: The digits in the units place cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, it's page 4; from 11-20, it's page 14, and so on.\n\nSince the book has 488 pages, there are 488 numbers. To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives me 48 full blocks of 10 and a remainder of 8. Each block contributes one 4, so that's 48 times. The last partial block (481-488) includes 484, which has a 4 in the units place, so that's one more. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The formula is usually floor((n + 1) / 10) for each digit, but maybe it's better to think as (n // 10) * 1 + (1 if the last digit is >= 4 else 0). Wait, no, perhaps a better approach is to calculate how many complete tens there are and then check the remainder.\n\nSo, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So there are 48 complete tens, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 * 1 = 48. Then, in the incomplete last ten (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 is included once (484). So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, for the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers, specifically from 40-49 in each hundred. So in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49). So how many hundreds are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. That's 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nThen, the last partial hundred is 401-488. In the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, ..., up to 8 for 481-490. But since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit is 8 for 481-488, which is 8 numbers. Wait, but 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit here is 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the tens place in the last partial hundred. Therefore, the tens place contributes 40 4's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but we only go up to 488). So in the tens place, 401-488 includes 40-49 in the hundreds place? Wait no, 401-488 is in the 400s, so the tens digit would be from 0 to 8. But 4 in the tens place would be from 440-449. Wait, no, wait: 401-488 is part of the 400s, so the tens digit in 401-488 can be 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-490). So 440-449 would be within 401-488, right? So in 440-449, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers. So that's 10 more 4's in the tens place. So total tens place 4's would be 4*10 (from the four complete hundreds) plus 10 from 440-449, making it 50.\n\nWait, that seems conflicting with my earlier thought. Let me clarify: Each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has a 40-49 section where the tens digit is 4, contributing 10 4's per hundred. So for 400-488, which is the 400s, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So in total, the 400s contribute 10 4's in the tens place. So from 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, 401-488 adds another 10 from 440-449, so total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but 400 is included in the 400s, so 401-488 is 88 pages, which includes 440-449 as part of that. So yes, that's correct.\n\n3. Hundreds place: Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but wait: 400 is the first number with hundreds digit 4, and 488 is the last. So the count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nSo total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\nNow, summing up all the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me check that addition: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Okay.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. Units place: Similar to 4, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers in the units place. So from 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nDivide 488 by 10: 48 full tens, remainder 8. Each full ten contributes one 8, so 48. Then, the last partial ten is 481-488, which includes 488, so that's one more 8. So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so yes, that's correct.\n\n2. Tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each hundred block contributes 10 8's in the tens place.\n\nFrom 1-488, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nNow, the last partial hundred is 401-488. In the tens place, 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So that's 9 more 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me confirm: In 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So yes, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo total 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So subtract the total 8's from the total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But let me just verify each step again to be sure.\n\nWait, in the tens place for 4's, I considered 401-488 and said that 440-449 contributes 10 4's, which is correct. So 4 complete hundreds (1-400) each contribute 10, so 4*10=40, plus 10 from 440-449, totaling 50. That seems right.\n\nIn the tens place for 8's, from 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place for 8's, in 480-488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So 9 8's in the tens place. So yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the hundreds place for 4's, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. That's correct.\n\nWait, but 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. Correct.\n\nIn the units place for 4's: 488 /10 = 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48, plus 1 more in the last partial ten, making 49. Correct.\n\nSame for 8's: 48 full tens, 48 8's, plus 1 in the last partial ten (488), so 49. Correct.\n\nWait, but in the units place for 8's, the last partial ten is 481-488, which includes 488, so that's one more 8. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98, difference: 90.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Page numbers go from 1 to 488, so each page number is a one, two, three, or four-digit number. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times 8 appears, then find the difference between those two counts.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units, tens, hundreds, and thousands. Since the book has 488 pages, the thousands place can only be 0 or 4, but since 488 is less than 1000, the thousands digit is 0 for all page numbers except maybe the last few? Wait, no, 488 is less than 1000, so the thousands digit is 0 for all pages. So I can ignore the thousands place because it doesn't contribute to 4's or 8's. That simplifies things a bit.\n\nNow, I'll look at the units place first. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each set of ten consecutive numbers. For example, from 1 to 10, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. But wait, actually from 1 to 10, the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So each digit appears once every ten numbers. But since we're starting at 1, the first set is 1-10, the next is 11-20, and so on.\n\nSo, for the units place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, in each block of ten numbers, 4 appears exactly once in the units place. Similarly, 8 appears once in each block of ten. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete tens in 488, which is 48 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete tens). But wait, that would give 48 times each. But wait, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48 times, and similarly for 8, it's also 48 times. But wait, let me check that. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). So, in each complete set, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place, so 48 times each. But in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So total units place 4's: 48 +1 = 49, and 8's: 48 +1 =49. Wait, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nWait, but let me check again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? For each ten numbers, 4 appears once. So 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So 4 appears once more, making it 49. Similarly, 8 appears once in each ten, so 48 times, and once more in the last partial set, making it 49. So yes, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and similarly, 8 appears 10 times.\n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then a partial hundred from 401-488.\n\nIn each complete hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so 4 times 10 is 40. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times in each hundred, so 4 times 10 is 40.\n\nNow, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, for the tens digit, how many times does 4 appear? From 400-499, the tens digit is 0-9 for each hundred, but we're only going up to 488. So, in 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. Wait, but 488 is less than 499, so does 440-449 fall within 401-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, in the partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place in 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, that's 9 times? Wait, no, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8, and there are 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the partial hundred.\n\nWait, let me make sure. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit, how many numbers are there? For tens digit 0: 401-410 (10 numbers), but wait, 401-410 would have tens digit 0, but 401 is actually 4-0-1, so tens digit 0. Similarly, 410 is 4-1-0, so tens digit 1. Wait, no, actually, the tens digit is determined by the second digit. So, for 401-410, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, which is 10 numbers. Then 411-420 have tens digit 1, and so on up to 480-489, which would have tens digit 8. But since we're only going up to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480-488.\n\nSo, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nTherefore, total tens digit 4's: 4 complete hundreds *10 =40, plus 10 in the partial hundred, so 50. Tens digit 8's: 4 complete hundreds *10=40, plus 9 in the partial hundred, so 49.\n\nWait, that seems right. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1,2,3, or 4 in this case because the book has 488 pages. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0 (since they're two-digit numbers), but in page numbers, 1 is just 1, so maybe I should consider that differently. Wait, no, page numbers start at 1, so pages 1-9 are single-digit, 10-99 are two-digit, 100-488 are three-digit. So, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in the range 1-488, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. There's no page with hundreds digit 8 because 800 is beyond 488. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, the count for 8 in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 +49 +0 = 98\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from the total 4's: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n- Each ten numbers contribute one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n- From 1-480, that's 480 numbers, so 48 sets of ten, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each.\n- Then from 481-488, units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n- So, units place: 48+1=49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred contributes 10 times 4 and 10 times 8 in the tens place.\n- From 1-400, that's four hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40 each.\n- Then from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449 (10 times) and 8 appears in 480-488 (9 times).\n- So, tens place: 40+10=50 for 4, and 40+9=49 for 8.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 times.\n- 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because 488 is less than 800, so 0 times.\n\nAdding up:\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets of 10, contributing 48 '4's and 48 '8's.\n   - In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), '4' appears once (484) and '8' appears once (488).\n   - Total in units place: 49 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred.\n   - From 1-400, there are four hundreds, contributing 40 '4's and 40 '8's.\n   - From 401-488, '4' appears 10 times (440-449) and '8' appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total in tens place: 50 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - '4' appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n   - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place within 488.\n   - Total in hundreds place: 89 '4's and 0 '8's.\n\n4. **Total Counts**:\n   - '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n5. **Difference**:\n   - 188 '4's - 98 '8's = 90\n\n**Answer**: The digit '4' is printed 90 times more than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488.\n\nI remember that to count the number of times a specific digit appears, I can look at each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. So, I'll need to calculate how many 4's and 8's appear in each place and then compare the totals.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times a specific digit appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10.\n\nWait, but since 488 isn't a multiple of 10, I need to adjust for the remaining pages. So, for the units place, the number of 4's would be the number of complete tens (which is 48) times 1 (since each ten has one 4 in the units place) plus whether the last partial set has a 4. The last set is pages 481 to 488, so the units digits go from 1 to 8. There's no 4 in this last set, so the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 * 1 = 48.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's in the units place, it's the same calculation. Each ten has one 8, so 48 tens give 48 eights. The last partial set from 481-488 includes an 8 in the units place (page 488), so we add 1 more. So, total 8's in units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Wait, page 488 is the last page, so the units digit is 8, so yes, that's correct. So, 48 eights from the complete tens and 1 more from the last page, making it 49 eights in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit appears 10 times in a block of 100. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 ten times each. So, for the 4's in the tens place, each hundred block has 10 pages where the tens digit is 4 (pages 40-49). Similarly, for 8's, it's pages 80-89.\n\nSince the book has 488 pages, that's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, for each hundred block, the number of 4's in the tens place is 10. So, 4 blocks give 4 * 10 = 40 fours in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, each hundred block contributes 10 eights, so 4 blocks give 4 * 10 = 40 eights in the tens place.\n\nBut wait, in the last partial block from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in pages 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in pages 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 9 pages (480-488). Wait, no, 480-489 is 10 pages, but the book stops at 488, so actually, pages 480-488 have the tens digit as 8, which is 9 pages. Wait, but 480-489 is 10 pages, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 9 pages. So, does that mean in the last block, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times?\n\nWait, let me think again. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for the tens digit 8, the pages are 480-489, but the book only goes up to 488, so that's 9 pages (480-488). So, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the last block. Therefore, the total number of 8's in the tens place is 4 * 10 (from the four full hundreds) plus 9 from the last partial hundred, totaling 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 blocks give 40, and the last partial block gives 9, so 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for the 4's in the tens place, in the last partial block (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in pages 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 4 * 10 (from the four full hundreds) plus 10 from the last partial block, totaling 50.\n\nWait, but wait, 401-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 pages, so yes, that's correct. So, 4 full hundreds give 40, plus 10 in the last block, totaling 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the number of 4's in the hundreds place is 89.\n\nThe digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is only 1, 2, 3, or 4. Therefore, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are, subtract the total 8's from the total 4's: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the units place for 4's: 48 times, correct because 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, and the last 8 pages (481-488) don't have a 4 in the units place, so yes, 48.\n\nUnits place for 8's: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, and the last page 488 adds one more, so 49, correct.\n\nTens place for 4's: Each hundred block has 10 pages where the tens digit is 4. There are four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, etc.), so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the last block (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so total 50. Correct.\n\nTens place for 8's: Each hundred block has 10 pages where the tens digit is 8. Four full hundreds give 40. In the last block, 480-488, which is 9 pages (since 488 is the last page), so 9 more, totaling 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 fours. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 8's: None, so 0.\n\nAdding up:\n4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 89 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 89 more than the number of 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Determine the total number of pages:** 488 pages.\n\n2. **Count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place (units, tens, hundreds).**\n\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - **4's:** Each 10 pages contribute one 4. There are 48 full sets of 10 pages (480 pages), contributing 48 fours. The last 8 pages (481-488) don't add any more 4's. Total: 48.\n     - **8's:** Similarly, 48 full sets contribute 48 eights. The last page (488) adds one more 8. Total: 49.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - **4's:** Each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Four full hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 fours. In the last partial hundred (401-488), pages 440-449 add 10 more fours. Total: 50.\n     - **8's:** Similarly, four full hundreds contribute 40 eights. In the last partial hundred, pages 480-488 add 9 eights. Total: 49.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - **4's:** Pages 400-488 contribute 89 fours. Total: 89.\n     - **8's:** No pages have 8 in the hundreds place. Total: 0.\n\n3. **Sum the counts:**\n   - **Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n4. **Calculate the difference:** 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI guess the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. \n\nFirst, looking at the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. \n\nNow, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, we'll take the integer part, which is 48 full sets. Each of these sets contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, after 480, we have pages 481 to 488, which is 8 more pages. In these, the units digit cycles from 1 to 8, so the digit 4 appears once more (page 484). So, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for pages 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, in 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10 times, and so on. \n\nLet's see how many hundreds are in 488. Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these contributes 10 times the digit 4 in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. \n\nNow, what about the remaining 88 pages (401-488)? The tens digit here ranges from 0 to 8. The digit 4 appears in the tens place from 440-449, which is 10 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10 times. So, total for the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, hold on, I think I made a mistake. Because 401-488 is 88 pages, and the tens digit cycles every 10 pages. So, in 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, it's 1; and so on. So, the digit 4 in the tens place occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so that's 10 times. Therefore, yes, 40 from the full hundreds and 10 from the remaining, totaling 50.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. That's 89 pages (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, hold on, 400 to 488 is 89 pages because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, that's 89 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus one more in 481-488, so 49. Tens place: each hundred contributes 10, so 4 hundreds give 40, plus in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10, so 50 total. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 times. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4, in every set of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (page 488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. Again, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 pages. For example, 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, in each hundred, that's 10 times. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here. Therefore, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me make sure. From 401-488, the tens digit cycles 0-8. The digit 8 in the tens place occurs from 480-488, which is 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). So, yes, 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is never 8. Therefore, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, that's 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI remember that to count the number of times a specific digit appears, I can look at each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds, etc. So, maybe I should calculate how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and do the same for the digit 8, then subtract the two totals to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So from 1 to 10, the digit 4 appears once (at page 4), and the digit 8 appears once (at page 8). This pattern repeats every 10 pages. So, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So there are 48 complete groups and an extra 8 pages.\n\nIn each complete group of 10, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for 48 groups, that's 48 times for each digit. Now, the remaining 8 pages (from 481 to 488) will have units digits from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). So, the total for the units place is 48 + 1 = 49 times for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 times for 8. Wait, that's the same, so the difference from units place is zero.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit changes every 10 pages. For example, from 1-9, the tens digit is 0, then from 10-19 it's 1, and so on. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears in the tens place for exactly 10 consecutive pages. So, for each digit, it appears 10 times every 100 pages. \n\nWait, but the book is 488 pages, so let me see. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. So, for each hundred, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 488 pages, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each full hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for 4 full hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 times for 4 and 40 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, the remaining 88 pages are from 401 to 488. Let's break this down. The tens digit in these pages goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? Well, 440-449 would be the next set where the tens digit is 4, but wait, 488 is only up to 488, so 440-449 is within 401-488. So, that's 10 pages (440-449), so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place here.\n\nSimilarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488. That's 9 pages (480-488), so the digit 8 appears 9 times here. Wait, but from 480-488, that's 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 times. Wait, but actually, 480-489 would be 10 pages, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 pages. So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the remaining 88 pages.\n\nSo, total for the tens place: 40 (from the full hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50 times for 4, and 40 (from the full hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49 times for 8. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times, so the difference here is 50 - 49 = 1 more 4 than 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit changes every 100 pages. From 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0. From 100-199, it's 1, from 200-299 it's 2, and so on up to 400-488, where it's 4. \n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. \n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would be where 8 appears in the hundreds place, but since the book only goes up to 488, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times and 8 appears 0 times. The difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let me add up the differences from each place. \n\nUnits place: 0 difference (49 each)\nTens place: 1 more 4\nHundreds place: 89 more 4's\n\nSo total difference is 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: Each 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once. 488 pages mean 48 full tens and 8 extra pages. So, 48*1 = 48, plus in the last 8 pages, 4 appears once at 484, and 8 appears once at 488. So total units: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4, 48 + 1 = 49 for 8. So, units difference is 0. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 full hundreds (1-400) give 4*10=40 each. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. The digit 4 in the tens place occurs from 440-449, which is 10 times. The digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 times. So, total tens for 4: 40 + 10 = 50, and for 8: 40 + 9 = 49. So, difference is 1. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 pages. So, 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488. So, 0 times. So, difference is 89.\n\nAdding up: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90. So, 4's appear 90 times more than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the digit 4 in the tens place occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. The digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 9 times. So, 50 vs 49, difference of 1. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have 4 at 484 and 8 at 488. So, 49 each. So, 0 difference. Correct.\n\nSo, total difference is 89 (hundreds) + 1 (tens) + 0 (units) = 90.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place.\n   - 488 pages mean 48 full groups of 10, contributing 48 each.\n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) add one 4 (at 484) and one 8 (at 488).\n   - Total: 49 each. Difference: 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n   - 4 full hundreds (1-400) give 40 each.\n   - From 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 for 4, 49 for 8. Difference: 1.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Difference: 89.\n\n4. **Total Difference:**\n   - Units: 0\n   - Tens: +1\n   - Hundreds: +89\n   - Total: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number is a three-digit number, right? From 1 to 488. Wait, actually, no, the first few pages are single-digit, then two-digit, and then three-digit numbers. So maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every 10 pages, the units digit cycles through 0 to 9. So in each set of 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. So if I can figure out how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488 pages, I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, every 100 pages, the tens digit cycles through 0 to 9 ten times each. So for example, from 0-99, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (40-49), and 8 for 10 pages (80-89). So each digit in the tens place appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n\nThe hundreds place is a bit trickier because not all hundreds are fully represented in a 488-page book. The hundreds digit goes from 0 to 4, but since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit for 4 only goes up to 488, not 500. So I'll need to adjust for that.\n\nWait, maybe I should calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately and then add them up.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nTotal number of pages is 488. So how many complete groups of 10 are there? That's 488 divided by 10, which is 48 with a remainder of 8. So there are 48 complete groups of 10 and 8 extra pages. In each group of 10, the units digit is 4 once and 8 once. So for 48 groups, that's 48 times 1 for 4's and 48 times 1 for 8's. But then we have 8 extra pages: 481 to 488. In these, the units digits are 1 through 8. So in the units place, the digit 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait a second. When I have 48 groups of 10, that's up to page 480. Then pages 481-488 are the extra. So in the units place, from 1-480, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times. So 4 appears 48 times, and 8 appears 48 times. Then from 481-488, units digits are 1-8. So 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488). So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So units place contributes equally, 49 each.\n\nNow moving to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each 100 pages. So in 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So there are 4 complete hundreds and 88 extra pages.\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49), and the digit 8 appears 10 times (80-89). So for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times for 4's and 40 times for 8's.\n\nNow, the extra 88 pages: from 400 to 488. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 4 complete hundreds would be up to page 400. Then the next 88 pages are 401-488. Wait, but that's not correct. Wait, 4 complete hundreds would be 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. So 400 pages. Then the remaining pages are 401-488, which is 88 pages.\n\nIn the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nWait, but 488 is only up to 488, so the last group is 481-488, which is 8 pages. So in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. The digit 8 appears in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 pages. So in the tens place, for the extra 88 pages (401-488), digit 4 appears 10 times, and digit 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo total tens place 4's: 4 * 10 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50.\n\nTens place 8's: 4 * 10 (from complete hundreds) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the complete hundreds (1-400), each hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place. So 4 hundreds * 10 = 40 each. Then in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (441-450) and 8 for 8 pages (481-488). So total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. 8's: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nWait, but wait, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit for 8 is only 8 pages because 488 is the last page. So yes, 8 pages where tens digit is 8.\n\nSo now, moving to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, 4 for 400-488. So how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So 4's in hundreds place: 89 times.\n\nWhat about 8's in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nSo the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nEach group of 10 has one 4 and one 8. 488 / 10 = 48 full groups, each contributing 1 to 4's and 1 to 8's. Then the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4's and 8's. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place. So 4 hundreds * 10 = 40 each. Then in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (441-450) and 8 for 8 pages (481-488). So 4's: 40 + 10 = 50, 8's: 40 + 8 = 48. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages. 8 never appears in the hundreds place, so 0.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So yes, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, when I calculated 4's in 401-488 as 10 pages, that's correct because 441-450 is 10 pages. Similarly, 481-488 is 8 pages, so 8's in tens place are 8.\n\nSo the total for 4's is indeed 188, and 8's is 97, so the difference is 91.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a way to cross-verify this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the total number of 4's and 8's in each digit place and sum them up.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488 / 10) = 48, plus if the last digit is >=4, add 1 if 488's units digit is >=4. Since 488 ends with 8, which is >=4, so 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in units place: same calculation, 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488 / 100) * 10 = 4 * 10 = 40. Then, the remaining pages are 488 % 100 = 88. So in the tens place, how many 4's in the last 88 pages? It's the number of times the tens digit is 4 in 0-88. The tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (40-49), so if 88 >= 49, which it is, then it's 10. So total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in tens place: floor(488 / 100) * 10 = 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the last 88 pages, the tens digit is 8 for 8 pages (80-88), since 88 is the limit. So 8's in tens place: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: if the hundreds digit is 4, then it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages. So 89.\n\nNumber of 8's: hundreds digit 8 would be from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are 0.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nI think that's correct. So the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 91.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number, right? Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI guess I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That way, I can count how many times 4 appears in each place and how many times 8 appears, then find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For the units digit, every 10 pages, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 appears once.\n\nNow, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're dealing with whole blocks, it's 48 full blocks and then 8 extra pages. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times in the full blocks, plus one more time in the last 8 pages (since the 48th block ends at 480, and the next pages are 481-488, so 484 has a 4 in the units place). Wait, no, 484 is in the 48th block? Wait, no, 480 is the end of the 48th block, then 481-488 is the 49th partial block. So in the units place, from 1 to 488, how many 4's? Each 10 pages, 4 appears once, so 48 times for the full blocks, and then in the last 8 pages (481-488), does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So yes, 484 has a 4 in the units place, so that's one more. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the units place 8's: each 10 pages, 8 appears once. So 48 times in the full blocks. Then, in the last 8 pages, 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So the difference in the units place is 0. Hmm, that's interesting. So maybe the difference comes from the tens or hundreds place.\n\nLet's move on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in a block of 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), then 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), and so on up to 9 (90-99). So each digit in the tens place appears 10 times per 100 pages.\n\nSo, how many full hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each of these 100-page blocks, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (e.g., 40-49 in the first block, 140-149 in the second, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n\nSo, for the tens place, in the 4 full hundreds, 4 appears 4*10 = 40 times, and 8 appears 4*10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nLet's see, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). Wait, actually, 401-410: tens digit is 0, 411-420: tens digit is 1, ..., 480-488: tens digit is 8.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? It would be from 440-449, but wait, 488 is the end, so 440-449 is within 401-488. So that's 10 times (440-449). But wait, 440-449 is 10 pages, but does 440 count as a page? Yes, because 440 is within 401-488. So that's 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, how about 8 in the tens place? That would be 480-488. So, from 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8, and there are 9 pages here (480-488 inclusive). So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the last partial hundred.\n\nSo, in the tens place, total 4's: 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50.\n\nTotal 8's: 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times, so the difference here is 1 more 4.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. For the hundreds digit, each digit from 1 to 4 appears in the hundreds place. Specifically, 1 appears 100 times (1-100), 2 appears 100 times (101-200), 3 appears 100 times (201-300), and 4 appears 88 times (301-488). Wait, 301-488 is 188 pages, but that's 188 pages, which would mean 188 numbers, but the hundreds digit is 3 from 301-399 (100 numbers) and 4 from 400-488 (89 numbers). Wait, 400-488 is 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive). So, 3 appears 100 times in the hundreds place, and 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, but 301-399 is 99 pages, right? Because 399 - 301 + 1 = 99. So, 3 appears 99 times in the hundreds place, not 100. Wait, no, because 301-399 is 99 numbers, each with hundreds digit 3. Similarly, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with hundreds digit 4.\n\nWait, let me correct that. The hundreds digit is 1 for 1-99 (but actually, 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit; they have one or two digits). Wait, actually, page 1 is just '1', so the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify.\n\nIn page numbers, the hundreds digit is only present when the page number is 100 or above. So, for pages 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, but since we're only counting digits printed, 0 isn't counted here. So, when considering the hundreds digit, we only look at pages 100 and above.\n\nSo, from 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, appearing 100 times (100-199 inclusive).\nFrom 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, appearing 100 times.\nFrom 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, appearing 100 times.\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all because the highest page is 488, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, the difference here is 89 more 4's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nUnits place:\n- 4's: 48 full blocks (1-480) with 48*1=48, plus 484, so 49.\n- 8's: 48 full blocks + 488, so 49.\n\nTens place:\n- 4's: 4*10=40 from full hundreds, plus 10 from 440-449, total 50.\n- 8's: 4*10=40 from full hundreds, plus 9 from 480-488, total 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's: 89 (from 400-488)\n- 8's: 0\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to 8's. \n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 pages. There are 48 full blocks of 10 pages, contributing 48 occurrences, plus one more in the last 8 pages (484), totaling 49.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times in each block of 100 pages. With 4 full blocks, that's 40 occurrences. Additionally, 440-449 adds 10 more, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 times.\n\n   **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears 49 times.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears 10 times in each block of 100 pages, totaling 40 from full blocks, plus 9 more in 480-488, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear.\n\n   **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number, right? Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, pages 1 through 9 are single-digit, 10 through 99 are two-digit, and 100 through 488 are three-digit numbers.\n\nI guess the first thing I should do is count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. Dividing 488 by 10 gives me 48 full groups of 10 and a remainder of 8. So, in each group of 10, there's one 4 in the units place. That would be 48 times, but wait, the last group only goes up to 488, which is 8 numbers beyond 480. So, in the last partial group, does the units digit 4 appear? Yes, because 484 is within 481 to 488. So, actually, it's 48 full groups plus one more in the last partial group, making it 49 times for the units place.\n\nWait, let me check that again. If I have 488 pages, then the number of times the units digit is 4 is equal to the number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. So, every 10 numbers, starting at 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. How many such numbers? Let's see, 484 is the last one before 488. So, from 4 to 484, that's 484 - 4 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 (since we include both endpoints) gives 49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 480-489 is beyond 488, so 480-488 would only include 480-488, but the tens digit here is 8, not 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nEach block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. For example, 40-49, which is 10 numbers, then 140-149, another 10, 240-249, another 10, 340-349, another 10, and 440-449, another 10. So that's 5 blocks of 100, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 440-449, which is entirely within 488, so we don't have to adjust for that. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is the sum of units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with units place: Similar to 4's, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then the last partial group from 481-488 includes 488, so that's another 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\nNow, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. So, how many blocks of 100 do we have? Each block contributes 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me make sure. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yep, that's correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, the hundreds digit is never 8 in any page number. So, 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 times.\n\nWait, but let me check again. For the tens place, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49, correct. So, 49 in tens, 49 in units, 0 in hundreds: 49+49=98.\n\nWait, but earlier for 4's, I had 188, and for 8's, 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me recount the number of 4's:\n\nUnits place: From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, and then the last group from 481-488 includes 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). So, in each of the first four hundreds, there's a block of 10 with tens digit 4, so 4*10=40. In the last hundred, 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens digit 4's: 5*10=50.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full groups, each with one 8, and the last group includes 488, so 49 times.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are 5 hundreds. In each, except the last one, there are 10 numbers. But in the last hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total tens digit 8's: 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: As before, no page numbers in 800s, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 +49 +0=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 -400 +1=89 numbers. So, 89 times the hundreds digit is 4. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, in the tens place, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the units place for 8's. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. So, 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and then the last group includes 488, so that's 49 times. So, 49 units digit 8's.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the units place, it's the same: 49 times.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, for 4's, we had 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 numbers, so 50 times. For 8's, we had 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, so 49 times.\n\nSo, 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 4's. Let me check again. For each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 0-99:40-49 (10 numbers), 100-199:140-149 (10), 200-299:240-249 (10), 300-399:340-349 (10), and 400-488:440-449 (10). So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, 50 times in the tens place for 4's. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place: 0-99:80-89 (10), 100-199:180-189 (10), 200-299:280-289 (10), 300-399:380-389 (10), and 400-488:480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nSo, 49 in tens place for 8's.\n\nSo, 4's total:188, 8's total:98. Difference:90.\n\nWait, but let me think about the hundreds place for 8's. Since the book only goes up to 488, there are no pages in the 800s, so the hundreds digit is never 8. So, 0 there.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is calculated by examining each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately. Similarly, the number of times the digit 8 appears is counted. \n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times\n\nThe difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " They go from 1 to 488, and each page number is printed once. So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by considering the different places where digits can appear: units place, tens place, hundreds place, and maybe even thousands place, although in this case, since the book only has 488 pages, the thousands place would only be relevant for the number 488 itself, but 488 is 4-8-8, so maybe I should check that as well.\n\nWait, actually, 488 is a three-digit number, so the thousands place isn't used here. So, the page numbers go from 1 up to 488, which is a three-digit number. So, I can analyze the occurrence of 4's and 8's in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\nLet me start by calculating the number of times 4 appears in each place.\n\nFirst, the units place: For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on.\n\nSo, how many such groups are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10 and then 8 extra pages (481 to 488). In each full group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so the digit 4 appears once more in 484. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\nWait, let me check that again. If I have 488 pages, the number of complete groups of 10 is 48 (since 48*10=480), and then 488-480=8 pages left. So, yes, each of the 48 groups contributes one 4 in the units place, and then in the last 8 pages, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The digit 4 can appear in the tens place as well. Each time the tens digit is 4, it contributes a 4. For example, from 40-49, each number has a 4 in the tens place, so that's 10 times. Similarly, from 140-149, another 10 times, and so on.\n\nLet me figure out how many such groups there are up to 488. The hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, but since we're starting from page 1, the hundreds digit starts at 0 (for pages 1-99) and goes up to 4 (for pages 400-488).\n\nWait, no, actually, page numbers start at 1, so the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, for each hundreds group, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\n- For hundreds digit 0 (pages 1-99): The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. Each time the tens digit is 4, that's 10 numbers (40-49). So, that's 10 times.\n- For hundreds digit 1 (pages 100-199): Similarly, the tens digit 4 occurs in 140-149, which is another 10 times.\n- For hundreds digit 2 (pages 200-299): Tens digit 4 occurs in 240-249, another 10 times.\n- For hundreds digit 3 (pages 300-399): Tens digit 4 occurs in 340-349, another 10 times.\n- For hundreds digit 4 (pages 400-488): The tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, but wait, does 440-449 fall within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's another 10 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: 440-449 is indeed within 400-488, so that's 10 times.\n\nSo, adding these up: 10 (for 0-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 50 times.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure that in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times. So, pages 440 to 449 would be 10 pages, so yes, that's correct. So, total 50 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. How many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place?\n\nWell, from 400 to 488, each page has 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400 up to 488, which is 89 pages because 488 - 400 = 88, and adding 1 gives 89. So, that's 89 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences of the digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, in each group of 10, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488 pages? 48 full groups (48*10=480) and 8 extra pages (481-488).\n\nSo, in each group of 10, 8 appears once in the units place, so 48 times. In the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in groups like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n- For hundreds digit 0 (pages 1-99): Tens digit 8 occurs in 80-89, which is 10 times.\n- For hundreds digit 1 (pages 100-199): Tens digit 8 occurs in 180-189, another 10 times.\n- For hundreds digit 2 (pages 200-299): Tens digit 8 occurs in 280-289, another 10 times.\n- For hundreds digit 3 (pages 300-399): Tens digit 8 occurs in 380-389, another 10 times.\n- For hundreds digit 4 (pages 400-488): Tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 times.\n\nWait, so in the hundreds digit 4 group, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo, adding these up:\n\n- 10 (0-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 49 times.\n\nSo, 49 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above. But since the book only has 488 pages, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, the digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place in any page number.\n\nSo, total 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so 98 total.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the tens place for 8's. In the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages, right? So, 9 times. So, 10 times for each of the first four hundreds groups (0,1,2,3) and 9 for the last one. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's.\n\nNumber of 4's: 188\nNumber of 8's: 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, checking the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full groups of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in 481-488, units digits go up to 8, so 484 has a 4, so +1. Total 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: For each hundreds group (0,1,2,3,4), the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times each. So, 5 groups, 10 each: 50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Correct.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 groups, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in 481-488, 488 has an 8, so +1. Total 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: For hundreds groups 0,1,2,3, each contributes 10 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 10 each for 4 groups: 40. Then, in the hundreds group 4 (400-488), the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: No 8's, as the book only goes up to 488. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nSo, difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again: 188 4's and 98 8's. So, 188 - 98 is indeed 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me just make sure I didn't miss any cases. For example, in the hundreds place for 4's, I considered 400-488 as 89 pages, which is correct because 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place for 4's, I had 10 times for each hundreds group, and there are 5 hundreds groups (0,1,2,3,4), so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 48 full groups, each contributing 1, and then one more in the last partial group, so 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, units place: 48 full groups, each contributing 1, and one more in the last partial group, so 49. Tens place: 10 for each of the first four hundreds groups, and 9 for the last one, totaling 49. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 90. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** In every group of 10 numbers, '4' appears once in the units place. There are 48 full groups (480 pages) and 8 extra pages (481-488). Thus, '4' appears 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n   - **Tens Place:** For each hundreds group (0-99, 100-199, etc.), '4' appears 10 times in the tens place. With 5 hundreds groups, this totals 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, '4' appears in the hundreds place for 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1).\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** Similarly, '8' appears 48 times in full groups and once in the last 8 pages, totaling 49 times.\n   - **Tens Place:** '8' appears 10 times in each of the first four hundreds groups and 9 times in the last group (480-488), totaling 49 times.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** '8' does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8'.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number, right? Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, I guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the different digit positions separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I think it's easier to count the occurrences in each position and then add them up.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, from 1 to 10, the digits in the units place are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, the digit 4 appears once in the units place every 10 numbers, and the same goes for 8. Now, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of 10, and then an extra 8 pages. In each complete group, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48, and the number of 8's is also 48. But wait, in the extra 8 pages (from 481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these extra pages, the digit 8 appears once in the units place (page 488), but the digit 4 doesn't appear in the units place in these extra pages because the units digits go up to 8, and 4 is before that. Wait, no, actually, in the extra group from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, the digit 4 does appear once in the units place (page 484) and the digit 8 appears once (page 488). So, in the units place, the count for 4's is 48 (from the complete groups) plus 1 (from the extra group) = 49. Similarly, the count for 8's is 48 plus 1 = 49. So, in the units place, both digits appear 49 times. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit changes every 10 pages. For example, from 1-9, the tens digit is 0, from 10-19 it's 1, 20-29 it's 2, and so on. So, each digit from 0 to 9 appears in the tens place exactly 10 times every 100 pages. Now, let's see how this applies to 488 pages.\n\nFirst, let's consider the tens digit. The number of times each digit appears in the tens place can be calculated by looking at how many complete hundreds are there and then the remaining pages.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4 (since 400-488 are in the 400s). So, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each hundred. Let's break it down:\n\n- Pages 1-99: Here, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. Wait, no, actually, for each ten pages, the tens digit is the same. For example, 10-19 have tens digit 1, 20-29 have 2, etc. So, in the first 99 pages, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 for each ten pages. So, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place from 1-99. So, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8.\n\n- Pages 100-199: Similarly, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 for each ten pages, so each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times.\n\n- Pages 200-299: Same as above, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times.\n\n- Pages 300-399: Same, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times.\n\n- Pages 400-488: Now, here, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digits go through 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Each of these digits appears 10 times except for the last one, which is 8, but since we're stopping at 488, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 times (pages 480-488). Wait, no, actually, each tens digit in 400-488 is as follows:\n\n- 400-409: tens digit 0\n- 410-419: tens digit 1\n- 420-429: tens digit 2\n- 430-439: tens digit 3\n- 440-449: tens digit 4\n- 450-459: tens digit 5\n- 460-469: tens digit 6\n- 470-479: tens digit 7\n- 480-488: tens digit 8, but only 9 pages (480-488 inclusive). So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in this range.\n\nSo, in the 400-488 range, the digit 4 appears in the tens place from 440-449, which is 10 times. The digit 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 times.\n\nSo, putting it all together for the tens place:\n\n- From 1-399: Each digit 4 and 8 appears 10 times in the tens place per hundred, so 3 hundreds (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) would be 4 hundreds? Wait, no, 1-99 is the first part, then 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, so up to 399, we have 4 sets of 100 pages each (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399). Each of these has 10 occurrences of 4 and 8 in the tens place. So, 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n\n- Then, in 400-488, as calculated, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n\nSo, total for tens place:\n\n- 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times. So, the difference here is 50 - 49 = 1.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. From 1-399, each hundred has 10 occurrences, so 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 for each digit. Then, in 400-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, yes, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's. So, the tens place contributes a difference of 1 in favor of 4's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place.\n\n- Pages 1-99: Hundreds digit is 0, so no 4 or 8 here.\n- Pages 100-199: Hundreds digit is 1, so no 4 or 8.\n- Pages 200-299: Hundreds digit is 2, so no 4 or 8.\n- Pages 300-399: Hundreds digit is 3, so no 4 or 8.\n- Pages 400-488: Hundreds digit is 4, so 4 appears here. How many times? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\n- Now, does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The next hundred would be 500-599, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 8's count in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89.\n\nNow, let's sum up the differences from each digit place:\n\n- Units place: 49 - 49 = 0\n- Tens place: 50 - 49 = 1\n- Hundreds place: 89 - 0 = 89\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again, especially for the hundreds place.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for each page. So, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, yes, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Since 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm supposed to count how many more 4's than 8's. So, the total number of 4's is the sum from units, tens, and hundreds places, and same for 8's. Let me compute the total counts for each digit.\n\nTotal 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nTotal 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I added the differences per digit place, I got 90, which matches. So, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the units place. From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nAs I calculated earlier, each group of 10 has one 4 in the units place, and there are 48 complete groups (since 488 / 10 = 48.8), so 48 times, plus in the last partial group (pages 481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (page 484). So, total 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears once in the units place in each group of 10, so 48 times, plus once in the last partial group (page 488), so total 49 times. So, units place is correct.\n\nIn the tens place, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me recalculate the tens place.\n\nFrom 1-99:\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\nFrom 100-199: same, 10 times each.\n\nFrom 200-299: same, 10 times each.\n\nFrom 300-399: same, 10 times each.\n\nFrom 400-488:\n\nTens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, each tens digit from 0-7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times (since 480-488 is 9 pages). So, for 4's in the tens place, it's 10 times (from 440-449). For 8's, it's 9 times (from 480-488).\n\nSo, total for tens place:\n\n4's: 10 (from 1-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 20? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, I think I messed up earlier. Wait, from 1-399, each hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 and 8 in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each contribute 10 times, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 for 4's and 40 for 8's.\n\nThen, in 400-488, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total for 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. For 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, that part is correct.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm counting correctly in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nIs there any other place where 8 appears in the hundreds place? No, because the next hundred would be 500, which is beyond 488. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't miss any other occurrence of 8 in the hundreds place. Since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit only goes up to 4, so no, 8 doesn't appear there.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me cross-verify this with another approach. Maybe I can calculate the total number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract.\n\nCalculating total 4's:\n\n- Units place: As before, 49 times.\n- Tens place: 50 times.\n- Hundreds place: 89 times.\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nCalculating total 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49 times.\n- Tens place: 49 times.\n- Hundreds place: 0 times.\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit surprised that the difference is so high. Let me check if I made a mistake in the hundreds place. 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, which is correct because from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages. So, 89 times.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, which is correct as we calculated.\n\nIn the units place, 49 times each for 4 and 8, so no difference there.\n\nSo, the total is indeed 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again: the hundreds place contributes 89 more 4's than 8's. The tens place contributes 1 more 4. Units place contributes 0. So, 89 + 1 = 90. That seems correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked all the parts, so I'm confident the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total groups of 10 in 488 pages: 48 complete groups and 8 extra pages.\n   - 4 appears once in each group, so 48 times from complete groups and once in the extra (page 484), totaling 49.\n   - 8 appears once in each group, so 48 times from complete groups and once in the extra (page 488), totaling 49.\n   - Difference in units place: 49 - 49 = 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - From 1-399: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times for 4 and 8, totaling 40 each.\n   - From 400-488: 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total for 4: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total for 8: 40 + 9 = 49.\n   - Difference in tens place: 50 - 49 = 1.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Difference in hundreds place: 89 - 0 = 89.\n\n4. **Total Difference:**\n   - Units: 0\n   - Tens: 1\n   - Hundreds: 89\n   - Total: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Page numbers start at 1 and go up to 488, so each page has a number from 1 to 488. Each digit in these numbers can be a 4 or an 8, and I need to count how many times each digit appears and then find the difference.\n\nI think the best approach is to count the number of 4's and 8's separately in each digit place: units, tens, hundreds, and then thousands if needed. Since 488 is a three-digit number, we'll go up to hundreds place. Let me start by considering each digit position one by one.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once and the digit 8 appears once. For example, in 1-10, 4 appears once (at 4), and 8 appears once (at 8). This pattern repeats every 10 numbers. Now, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and then an extra 8 numbers (481-488). So, in the units place, each digit 4 and 8 appears 48 times in each block, so 48 times each. But wait, I need to check the remaining 8 numbers to see if there's an extra 4 or 8 in the units place.\n\nLooking at the last partial block, which is 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in this partial block, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). Therefore, in the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 (from complete blocks) + 1 (from the partial block) = 49. Similarly, the total number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, in the units place, the count is equal. Let me note that down: units place, 4's: 49, 8's: 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). In each hundred block, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and the digit 8 appears 10 times (80-89). Now, how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial hundred from 401-488.\n\nSo, in each complete hundred, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times each. Now, let's check the partial hundred from 401-488. The tens digits here range from 0 (for 401-410) to 8 (for 480-488). Wait, but actually, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Let me list the tens digits:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so up to 488. So, in the tens place, from 401-488, how many times does 4 and 8 appear?\n\nLooking at the tens digits:\n\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4, so that's 10 numbers, so 10 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8, but how many numbers here? From 481 to 488, that's 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers. So, 8 times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\nWait, but wait, 481-488 is 8 numbers, right? 481,482,...,488. So, the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers. So, in the partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 8 times. So, adding that to the 40 from the complete hundreds:\n\nTotal 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 + 8 = 48\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 48 times.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. From 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 441-450, which is 10 times, and 8 in 481-488, which is 8 times. So, yes, 10 and 8. So, total for 4's in tens place is 40 (from 1-400) + 10 = 50, and 8's is 40 (from 1-400) + 8 = 48.\n\nWait, but wait, from 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 for both. Then, from 401-488, 4's in tens place: 10 times (441-450), and 8's: 8 times (481-488). So, yes, 4's total 50, 8's total 48.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought 481-488 is 8 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? So, that's 8 times 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers, so that's 8 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's:50, 8's:48.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, from 1-488, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, that's correct because the highest page is 488, so hundreds digit goes up to 4, not 8. So, 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, now, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = let's compute that.\n\n49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4's appear 188 times.\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nWait, 49 + 48 is 97, right? Yes.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. So, how many more 4's than 8's? That would be 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- Each 10 numbers, 4 and 8 each appear once in units place.\n- 488 pages: 48 full tens, and 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n- So, 48*1 = 48 for each, plus in the last 8 numbers, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each 100 numbers, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place.\n- 488 pages: 4 full hundreds, so 4*10=40 for each.\n- Then, in 401-488, the tens digits:\n  - 441-450: 10 times 4.\n  - 481-488: 8 times 8.\n- So, 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 8's: 40 + 8 = 48\nThat seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 400-488: 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times.\n- 8 never appears in hundreds place because the book ends at 488.\n- So, 4's: 89, 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49+48=97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me just check if I considered all the digits correctly, especially in the tens place for the partial hundred.\n\nIn the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. The tens digit is 8 in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so that's 8 occurrences. So, yes, 10 and 8 respectively.\n\nAnother way to check is to calculate the total number of digits and see if the counts make sense.\n\nTotal pages: 488.\n\nTotal digits: Each page number is up to 3 digits, so:\n\n- Pages 1-9: 1 digit each, 9 pages, 9 digits.\n- Pages 10-99: 2 digits each, 90 pages, 180 digits.\n- Pages 100-488: 3 digits each, 389 pages, 1167 digits.\nTotal digits: 9 + 180 + 1167 = 1356 digits.\n\nNow, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 97. So, 188 + 97 = 285 digits accounted for. The rest are other digits, which should be 1356 - 285 = 1071, which seems reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, let's check another digit, say 1, to see if the method is correct. But maybe that's overcomplicating.\n\nWait, another way to check: in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, which is from 400-488, which is correct.\n\nIn the tens place, in the partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 8 times, which seems correct.\n\nWait, another thing: in the units place, from 1-488, how many 4's and 8's are there?\n\nEach 10 numbers, one 4 and one 8. So, 48 full tens: 48*1=48 each. Then, the last partial ten is 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so units digits 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total 49 each. That's correct.\n\nSo, yes, I think the calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 97, so 188 - 97 = 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each 10 numbers contribute one 4 and one 8.\n   - 48 full tens: 48 occurrences each.\n   - Last 8 numbers (481-488): one 4 and one 8.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each 100 numbers contribute 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place.\n   - 4 full hundreds: 40 occurrences each.\n   - Last partial hundred (401-488):\n     - 441-450: 10 times 4.\n     - 481-488: 8 times 8.\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 8 = 48\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 400-488: 89 occurrences of 4.\n   - No occurrences of 8.\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI guess I should analyze the digits in each place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Maybe I can count how many times 4 appears in each place and do the same for 8, then subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in the units place. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, 4 appears once and 8 appears once.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and then a partial block of 8 numbers (since 488 = 48*10 + 8). \n\nIn each complete block, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 blocks, that would be 48 4's and 48 8's in the units place.\n\nNow, let's check the partial block from 481 to 488. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in this partial block, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). \n\nSo, in the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 + 1 = 49, and the total number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, they are equal.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit goes through 0-9 ten times each. Wait, no, actually, from 1 to 100, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each, but starting from 10, 20, etc. So, for each hundred, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, for 488 pages, how many hundreds are there? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, we have four complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then the last 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for each hundred, that's 10 4's and 10 8's.\n\nSince there are four complete hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 4's and 4 * 10 = 40 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's check the partial hundred from 401 to 488. The tens digit here goes from 0 (for 401-409) to 8 (for 480-488). So, we need to see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place in this range.\n\nLooking at the tens digit in 401-488: the tens digits go from 0 (for 401-409), 1 (410-419), ..., up to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit is 4 when the page numbers are 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, the tens digit is 8 when the page numbers are 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480-488), so 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, in the partial hundred, we have 10 4's and 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nTherefore, total in the tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 = 50 4's, and 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 = 49 8's.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times. That's a difference of 1 more 4.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, which we can ignore. From 100-488, the hundreds digit cycles as follows: 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488).\n\nSo, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nThe digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times, and 8's appear 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the total number of 4's and 8's across all places.\n\nTotal 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nTotal 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nFirst, units place:\n- Each 10 numbers contribute 1 4 and 1 8.\n- 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens and 8 extra numbers.\n- 48 * 1 = 48 for each digit, plus in the last 8 numbers (481-488), 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n- So, units place: 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n- 4 hundreds, so 40 each.\n- In the last partial hundred (401-488), tens place:\n  - 4 in tens place: 440-449, which is 10 numbers.\n  - 8 in tens place: 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n- So, 10 more 4's and 9 8's.\n- Total tens place: 50 4's and 49 8's. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n- 8 doesn't appear in hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAdding up:\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n- Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again: from 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times the hundreds digit is 4, so 89 4's. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place in the last partial hundred, 480-488: that's 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, that seems high, but maybe that's correct. Let me see another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately and see if I get the same result.\n\nCalculating number of 4's:\n\nUnits place:\n- Each 10 numbers have one 4. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus in the last 8 numbers, 481-488, 4 appears once (484). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place. 4 hundreds, so 40. Plus in the last partial hundred, 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10. Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\nUnits place:\n- Each 10 numbers have one 8. 48 full tens, so 48. Plus in the last 8 numbers, 488 is the only one with 8 in units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred contributes 10 8's in the tens place. 4 hundreds, so 40. Plus in the last partial hundred, 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n- No 8's, as before.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot. Let me check another approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nNumber of 4's in units place:\n- For each group of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place.\n- Total groups of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full groups (1-480) and a partial group (481-488).\n- In each full group, 1 four, so 48 * 1 = 48.\n- In the partial group (481-488), check if 484 is included, which it is, so 1 more.\n- Total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in units place:\n- Each group of 10 has one 8.\n- 48 full groups: 48 * 1 = 48.\n- Partial group (481-488) includes 488, which has an 8 in units place, so 1 more.\n- Total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's in tens place:\n- For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each.\n- So, in each hundred, 10 times the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n- There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 4's in the tens place: 4 * 10 = 40.\n- Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n- Total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNumber of 8's in tens place:\n- Similarly, each hundred contributes 10 8's in the tens place (80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n- 4 complete hundreds: 4 * 10 = 40.\n- In the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page), so 9 8's.\n- Total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's in hundreds place:\n- Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place.\n- Number of pages: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n- So, 89 4's.\n\nNumber of 8's in hundreds place:\n- Pages 800-899 would have 8, but the book only goes up to 488, so 0.\n\nAdding up:\n\nTotal 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think this confirms the earlier calculation. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers is 188, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number, right? Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI guess I should separate the problem into counting the number of 4's and the number of 8's in each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start with the 4's. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of 10 numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once. How many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, we take the integer part, which is 48 complete groups. So that gives 48 times 1, which is 48 fours. But wait, after 480, we have 481 to 488, which is 8 more pages. In those, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more in 484. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit is 4 for numbers 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, from 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10, and so on. So how many hundreds are there in 488? That's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. \n\nFor each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So 4 hundreds would give 4*10 = 40 fours. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 488 is less than 449? No, wait, 401-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's another 10 fours. So total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers 400-488. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers, contributing 89 fours.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: Units (49) + Tens (50) + Hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So there are 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's. Starting with the units place: Similar to 4's, in each group of 10, the digit 8 appears once. So 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing 1, so 48 eights. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The tens digit is 8 for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each such block has 10 numbers. How many hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds. In each, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times, so 4*10 = 40 eights. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So that's 9 eights. Therefore, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds place 8's. So hundreds place contributes 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once.\n   - Total groups of 10 in 488: 48 full groups (480 pages) + 8 extra pages (481-488).\n   - 48 * 1 = 48 fours.\n   - In 481-488, 4 appears once (484).\n   - Total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 40-49).\n   - 4 full hundreds (1-400) contribute 4 * 10 = 40 fours.\n   - In 401-488, 440-449 contributes another 10 fours.\n   - Total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - Total hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once.\n   - 48 full groups contribute 48 eights.\n   - In 481-488, 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89).\n   - 4 full hundreds contribute 4 * 10 = 40 eights.\n   - In 401-488, 480-488 contributes 9 eights (480-488).\n   - Total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The hundreds digit 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI remember that to count how many times a particular digit appears, I can look at each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. So, I'll need to count how many 4's appear in the units place, how many in the tens place, and how many in the hundreds place. I'll do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:** In every set of ten numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of ten, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 times. But wait, the last partial set is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. In this partial set, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of ten numbers. For example, 40-49 have 4 in the tens place for each of those ten numbers. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? The first block is 40-49, which is one block. The next would be 140-149, another block, and so on. To find how many blocks there are, I can divide 488 by 100, which gives 4.88. So, there are 4 complete blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349). Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 blocks give 4*10=40. Now, checking the last partial block from 440-449: wait, 488 is beyond 449, so 440-449 is another full block, making it 5 blocks in total. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 488 is less than 500. Let me think again. The blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. But 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10 4's. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's correct. So, tens place 4's are 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, in each set of ten, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of ten? 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. The last partial set is 481-488, which includes 8 in the units place (488). So, units place 8's are 48 +1 =49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Let's see how many such blocks are there up to 488. Each block is 100 numbers, so 488 /100 =4.88, so 4 complete blocks. Each block contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, the next block would be 480-489, but since our book ends at 488, we only have 480-488, which is 9 numbers. In these, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers, so that's 9 more 8's. So, total tens place 8's are 40 +9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor the 4's:\n\n- Units: 48 full decades, each contributing 1, so 48, plus the last partial decade (481-488) has 488, which is 8 in units, so actually, 481-488: the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once in 484, so yes, units place 4's are 48 +1=49.\n\n- Tens: The blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 10 each, 50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89=188.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\n- Units: 48 full decades, 48, plus 488, so 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 (4 blocks, 40), plus 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more. Total 49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds: None, since 488 <800. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 +49=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 4's. Let me check again. The blocks are 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (another 10), 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's in the tens place, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, which is 4 blocks, each 10, so 40. Then 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 more, total 49. That seems right.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488.\n\nI guess the best way to approach this is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. Units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so actually, there are 49 times when the units digit is 4, because the last group would be 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 484, which is the 49th occurrence. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as 488 // 10 = 48, but since 488 is included, and 488 mod 10 is 8, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, that's not right because 488 is 48*10 + 8, so the units digit cycles 48 full times, each contributing one 4, so 48 times, and then in the 49th group, we have 480-489, but since we stop at 488, the units digit 4 occurs once more at 484. So total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, maybe I should use a formula. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is given by floor(n/10) + 1 if the last digit is >= d, else floor(n/10). But wait, let me test this.\n\nAlternatively, for units digit, the number of 4's is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus 1 if the units digit of n is >=4. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor(488/10) = 48. Then, since 8 >= 4, we add 1, so total 49 4's in the units place.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, for the tens digit. The digit 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there?\n\nFrom 1 to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488). So, the tens digit is 4 in the following ranges:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So total tens place 4's: 5*10=50.\n\n3. Hundreds place: Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 occurrences. So, hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\nNow, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 +89=188.\n\nWait, let me add again: 49 +50=99, 99+89=188. So total 4's: 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. Units place: Similar to 4's, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nUsing the same method as before: floor(488/10)=48, and since 8 >=8, we add 1, so 48 +1=49. So, units place 8's:49.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, the tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-489 would only go up to 488. So, how many full blocks do we have?\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, the first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9. So total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=40+9=49.\n\nWait, let me confirm: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9 (since 488 is included). So yes, 4*10 +9=49.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's:0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=49+49=98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, total 4's:188, total 8's:98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, for the 4's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50=99; 99+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, another way to check: For hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nFor tens place, 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449: each is 10 numbers, 5 blocks, so 50 4's.\n\nUnits place: every 10 numbers, so 488//10=48, plus 1 because 488's units digit is 8 >=4, so 49.\n\nTotal 4's:89+50+49=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nHundreds place: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nTens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488: first four blocks are 10 each, last block is 9, so 4*10 +9=49.\n\nUnits place: same as 4's, 49.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me recount.\n\nIn the tens place, the digit 8 appears in:\n\n- 80-89:10 numbers\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 numbers\n\nSo that's 4 full blocks of 10 and one partial block of 9, totaling 4*10 +9=49. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I think about 480-488, that's 9 numbers:480,481,...,488. So yes, 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, yes, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for 8's would contribute something, but since the book ends at 488, which is less than 800, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the units place for 8's. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers:8,18,28,...,488. So, how many terms are there?\n\nThe first term is 8, the last term is 488. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So yes, 49 times.\n\nSame for 4's in units place:4,14,24,...,484. The last term is 484 because 488's units digit is 8, which is higher than 4, so the last 4 in units place is 484. So, number of terms: (484-4)/10 +1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, and the last 4 is at 484).\n- **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, there are 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488 (9 numbers), totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears, and then find the difference between those two counts. That makes sense. So, I should probably go through each digit place\u2014units, tens, hundreds\u2014and count the occurrences of 4 and 8 separately.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every set of ten consecutive numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So in each set of ten, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. That means for each ten numbers, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. \n\nNow, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 complete sets of ten, and then an extra 8 pages (481 to 488). So in each of these 48 complete sets, we have 48 occurrences of 4 and 48 occurrences of 8 in the units place. \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because each set of ten contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so for 48 sets, that would be 48 times 1 for each digit, so 48 4's and 48 8's in the units place. But then we have the last 8 pages, from 481 to 488. Let me check those. \n\nFrom 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So in the units place, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So in the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 (from the complete sets) plus 1 (from the last partial set), making it 49. Similarly, the total number of 8's in the units place is 48 plus 1, which is also 49. \n\nWait, that seems like they're equal so far, but I might have made a mistake here. Let me double-check. Each complete set of ten has one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 sets would give 48 each. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So 484 is within this range, contributing one more 4, and 488 is also in this range, contributing one more 8. So yes, units place gives 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, in each hundred, there are 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial hundred from 401-488. \n\nIn each of these 4 complete hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), so that's 4 times 10, which is 40 4's in the tens place. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times in each hundred, so that's 4 times 10, which is 40 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, looking at the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. \n\nThe tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 occurrences. But wait, 440 is within 401-488, so yes, that's 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488), so that's 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480 is the first and 488 is the last. So, 480, 481, ..., 488 is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, from 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). \n\nSo, adding that to the previous counts: total 4's in tens place = 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50. Total 8's in tens place = 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for those 9 numbers, so that's 9 8's in the tens place. So, 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here because 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. But in 401-488, 440-449 is entirely within that range, so yes, that's correct. And 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, moving on, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so it doesn't contribute any 4's or 8's. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's. From 200-299, it's 2, so again, no 4's or 8's. From 300-399, it's 3, so no. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's where 4's will appear in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these page numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 4's.\n\nAs for 8's in the hundreds place, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8's in the hundreds place are zero.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow for 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place: 48 complete sets of ten, each contributing one 4 and one 8. So 48 each. Then, the last partial set from 481-488, which adds one more 4 and one more 8. So units place: 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each complete hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So 4 hundreds give 40 each. Then, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. The tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. So total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89 4's. 8's in hundreds place: 0. That's correct.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, but let me think again. Is the count in the hundreds place correct? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so yes, 89 4's.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So 9 8's in the tens place. So 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the units place. Let me check again. The last partial set is from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So units place counts are correct: 49 each.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When counting the tens place in the partial hundred (401-488), I considered the tens digit 4 appearing in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. Similarly, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the units place again. Each complete set of ten (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So for 488 pages, how many complete sets of ten are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 and one 8. So 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) contribute one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488). So units place: 48 +1 =49 for 4's and 48 +1=49 for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, 4's total 188 and 8's total 98, so the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Units Place Analysis:**\n   - Each set of 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) contains exactly one '4' and one '8' in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488 pages (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8).\n   - Each set contributes 1 '4' and 1 '8', totaling 48 each.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one more '4' (484) and one more '8' (488).\n   - **Total in units place:** 49 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place Analysis:**\n   - Each set of 100 consecutive numbers (e.g., 1-100) has 10 occurrences of '4' and 10 of '8' in the tens place.\n   - There are 4 complete hundreds in 488 pages (400 pages), contributing 40 '4's and 40 '8's.\n   - The remaining 88 pages (401-488) are analyzed:\n     - '4' in tens place: 440-449 (10 occurrences).\n     - '8' in tens place: 480-488 (9 occurrences).\n   - **Total in tens place:** 50 '4's (40 + 10) and 49 '8's (40 + 9).\n\n3. **Hundreds Place Analysis:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have '4' in the hundreds place, contributing 89 '4's.\n   - No page numbers have '8' in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 89 '4's and 0 '8's.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488.\n\nI guess the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have those counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately.\n\n1. **Units place (the first digit from the right):** The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n\n   Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and a partial block of 8. In each full block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. In the partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place (the second digit from the right):** The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each cycle of 100 has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Now, how many such blocks are there?\n\n   Since the book has 488 pages, we have 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and a partial block from 400-488. In each full hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49), so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the partial block (400-488), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (440-449). However, since 440-449 is within 400-488, that's another 10 times. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 488 is less than 499, so 440-449 is fully included. So, 40 + 10 = 50 times for the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place (the third digit from the right):** The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 4's in total.\n\nNext, I'll do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, in every block of 10, 8 appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks and a partial block of 8. So, 48 times in full blocks, and in the partial block (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit cycles every 100. Each cycle has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). Now, how many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 8's, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the partial block 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 480-489. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 times. So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 full blocks (each contributing 1) = 48, plus 1 in the partial block = 49.\n- Tens: 4 full hundreds (each 10) = 40, plus 10 in 440-449 = 50.\n- Hundreds: 89 times (400-488 inclusive).\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full blocks = 48, plus 1 in 481-488 = 49.\n- Tens: 4 full hundreds = 40, plus 9 in 480-488 = 49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to 8's. \n\n1. **Counting 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll go through each place one by one.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. So, for the units place, the count of 4's and 8's should be the same, right? \n\nBut wait, the book has 488 pages, which isn't a multiple of 10. Let me calculate how many complete sets of 10 there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). \n\nIn each complete set of 10, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 sets would give me 48 4's and 48 8's in the units place. Now, the extra 8 numbers: 481 to 488. Let me list them out: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. \n\nLooking at the units digits here: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So, in the units place, there's a 4 (in 484) and an 8 (in 488). So that's one more 4 and one more 8 in the units place. \n\nWait, but in the units place, the extra numbers contribute one 4 and one 8. So, the total for units place: 48 + 1 = 49 4's and 48 + 1 = 49 8's. So, in the units place, they're equal. \n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and the same for 8 (80-89). \n\nBut again, since the book ends at 488, I need to check if the last hundred is complete. The hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 400-488. Let me break it down:\n\n- Pages 1-99: Here, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n- Pages 100-199: Similarly, the tens digit cycles again, so another 10 4's and 10 8's.\n- Pages 200-299: Another 10 4's and 10 8's.\n- Pages 300-399: Another 10 4's and 10 8's.\n- Pages 400-488: Now, here, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480, 481, ..., 488 is 9 numbers. Hmm, wait, no: from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the 400-488 range.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 400 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit, it's 10 numbers except for the last one, which is only 9. So, for tens digit 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here.\n\nSo, let me add up the tens digits:\n\n- 1-99: 10 4's, 10 8's\n- 100-199: 10 4's, 10 8's\n- 200-299: 10 4's, 10 8's\n- 300-399: 10 4's, 10 8's\n- 400-488: 10 4's, 9 8's\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 10 * 4 = 40\nTotal 8's in tens place: 10 * 4 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49\n\nWait, that can't be right because 400-488 only adds 10 4's and 9 8's. So, total 4's in tens place: 10 (from 1-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 50 4's.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in tens place: 10 (1-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 49 8's.\n\nWait, so in the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 49. So, 4's are one more than 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought each hundred had 10 4's and 10 8's, but in the last hundred, 400-488, the 8's in the tens place are only 9, not 10. So, that's why 8's are one less.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, let's see:\n\n- Pages 1-99: Hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's.\n- Pages 100-199: Hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's.\n- Pages 200-299: Hundreds digit is 2, so no 4's or 8's.\n- Pages 300-399: Hundreds digit is 3, so no 4's or 8's.\n- Pages 400-488: Hundreds digit is 4, so every page from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nBut wait, 400 to 488 is 89 pages, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. How about 8's in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's are 89 and 8's are 0.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place:\n\n- Units place:\n  - 4's: 49\n  - 8's: 49\n- Tens place:\n  - 4's: 50\n  - 8's: 49\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 4's: 89\n  - 8's: 0\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, wait a minute, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check my calculations because 188 - 98 = 90, but I feel like that might be too high. Let me go through each place again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 484, which has a 4 in the units place. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 4's in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in the units place: same logic. 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus the remaining 8 numbers include 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\nFrom 1-99: 10 4's, 10 8's\n100-199: 10 4's, 10 8's\n200-299: 10 4's, 10 8's\n300-399: 10 4's, 10 8's\n400-488: Now, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, for 4's in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 pages. For 8's, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages because 488 is the last page.\n\nSo, 4's in tens place: 10 each in the first four hundreds (1-399) and 10 in 400-488, so 10*4 +10=50\n8's in tens place: 10 each in the first four hundreds and 9 in 400-488, so 10*4 +9=49\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place:50, 8's:49\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly in 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's. 8's in hundreds place: none, since the book ends at 488, so 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99+89=188\nTotal 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I thought maybe the difference would be smaller, but maybe it's correct. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, 4's are 89, which is a lot. So, that's a big contributor to the total number of 4's. So, 89 4's from hundreds place, 50 from tens, 49 from units, totaling 188.\n\n8's: 49 from units, 49 from tens, 0 from hundreds, so 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each set of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 full sets, contributing 48 each.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - From 1-399: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's.\n   - From 400-488: 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 4\u00d710 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Only in 400-488, contributing 89 4's.\n   - 8's: 0\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number, right? So, from page 1 to page 488, the page numbers go from 1 up to 488.\n\nI guess the first thing I should do is figure out how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the different positions where the digits can appear: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll need to check each position separately for both 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every group of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has one 4 in the units place. So, how many such groups are there up to 488? Let me calculate 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we take the integer part, which is 48. So, 48 times. But wait, in the last group, which is 481-490, but our book ends at 488, so the units digit 4 appears in 484. So, does that mean 48 times? Hmm, maybe. Let me check: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically for 10 numbers at a time. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. So, how many such groups are there up to 488? Let's see, the first group is 40-49, the second would be 140-149, then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? So that's 5 groups. Each group contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, 5 groups * 10 = 50 times.\n\nWait, but does 440-449 count as a full group? Since 488 is beyond 449, yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 5 groups.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? Well, from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 times.\n\nNow, adding up the occurrences of 4 in each place: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, the digit 4 appears 187 times.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Again, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups. So, 48 times. But wait, in the last group, 481-490, the units digit 8 is at 488, which is within the book. So, yes, 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically for 10 numbers at a time. So, the groups would be 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, the first four groups (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 numbers, and the last group 480-488 has 9 numbers. So, total occurrences in the tens place: 4 groups * 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. Yes, that's correct.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800 to 899. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. Therefore, the hundreds digit 8 doesn't appear at all. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up the occurrences of 8: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97 times.\n\nWait, but let me check if I missed any. For the units place, 488 is included, so 8 in units place occurs 48 times. For the tens place, as calculated, 49 times. So, 97 total.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. Let me go through each step again.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 times. Because 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place.\n- Tens: 5 groups (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50.\n- Hundreds: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\nTotal: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 times, same as above.\n- Tens: 4 full groups (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each with 10, so 4*10=40, plus 480-488 which is 9, so 40+9=49.\n- Hundreds: 0, since the book doesn't go beyond 488.\nTotal: 48 + 49 = 97.\n\nSo, 187 - 97 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 = 88, but since both ends are inclusive, it's 89. Yes.\n\nAnd for the tens place of 4, the groups are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct, 5 groups.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, the last group is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so yes, 9. So, 4 groups of 10 and 1 group of 9, totaling 49.\n\nI think that's correct. So, 97 8's and 187 4's, difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nAlternatively, for units digit: from 1 to n, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place is floor((n + 1)/10). But wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of full cycles and remainders.\n\nWait, for units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's in units place: For each 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, up to 488, how many full decades are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4, so 48. Plus, in the last partial decade (481-488), does 4 appear in the units place? 484 is in that range, so yes, one more, making it 49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, now I'm confused.\n\nWait, no, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify.\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to number n can be calculated as:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: floor(n / 10). Each group contributes one occurrence. Then, if the last partial group (from 10*floor(n/10)+1 to n) includes d, add 1.\n\nSo, for 4 in units place up to 488:\n\nfloor(488 / 10) = 48. So, 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4, so 48.\n\nNow, check if the last partial group (481-488) includes a number ending with 4. 484 is in that range, so yes, add 1. So, total 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 48. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, no, let me think again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (1-480), and then 481-488 is the 49th cycle, but only 8 numbers. In that last cycle, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (at 484). So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nWait, so earlier I was wrong. The correct number of 4's in the units place is 49, not 48.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place: floor(488 / 10) = 48, and in the last partial group (481-488), 8 appears at 488, so add 1. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, so both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place. That changes things.\n\nSimilarly, let's recalculate the tens place.\n\nFor 4 in the tens place: It appears in the tens digit for numbers 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 groups, 10 each, totaling 50.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place: It appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four groups are 10 numbers each, and the last group is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, so 4 in tens place is 50, 8 in tens place is 49.\n\nNow, for hundreds place:\n\n4 in hundreds place: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\n8 in hundreds place: from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place for 4 was 48, but now I'm getting 49. So, that changes the total count.\n\nWait, so where did I go wrong earlier? I think I confused whether to include the last partial group or not. So, the correct count for units place for both 4 and 8 is 49.\n\nSo, 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, so the initial calculation was correct, but when I thought I made a mistake, I realized that units place for 4 is actually 49, not 48, which changes the total. So, the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the units place calculation again to be sure.\n\nFor units digit 4:\n\nNumbers where units digit is 4 up to 488 are: 4,14,24,...,484.\n\nHow many such numbers? The sequence is 4 + 10k, where k is 0,1,2,...,n.\n\nThe last term is 484, which is 4 + 10*(48) = 484. So, k goes from 0 to 48, which is 49 terms. So, 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for units digit 8: 8,18,28,...,488.\n\nThe last term is 488, which is 8 + 10*(48) = 488. So, k goes from 0 to 48, which is 49 terms. So, 49 times.\n\nSo, yes, both units digits for 4 and 8 occur 49 times.\n\nTherefore, the correct total for 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nFor 8's, it's 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I thought units place for 4 was 48, but upon re-evaluating, it's 49. So, that changes the total count.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n- Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct now.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers is calculated by considering each digit position (units, tens, hundreds). \n\n- **Units place:** 4 appears 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears 89 times.\n\nTotal for 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n\n- **Units place:** 8 appears 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear.\n\nTotal for 8: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nThe difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number, right?\n\nLet me start by considering the different positions where the digits can appear: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each of these positions and do the same for the digit 8. Then, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles through 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for 8. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). In each complete set, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So that's 48 times each. Now, looking at the extra numbers from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1 through 8. So, the digit 4 appears once more in 484, and 8 appears once more in 488. So, total units place counts: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4's and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8's. Wait, that seems like they're equal in the units place. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there. Let me check again. From 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of 10, so 48 4's and 48 8's. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 has a 4, and 488 has an 8. So, that's one more 4 and one more 8. So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4's and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8's. So, they are equal in the units place. Interesting.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (80-89). Now, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, there are 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 4's and 40 8's. Now, looking at the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, and 8 for 480-489, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, from 401-488, the digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total tens place counts: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's. So, in the tens place, there are 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\nNow, onto the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. Wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times. How about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place counts: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences of 4's and 8's across all digit positions.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nUnits place:\n- 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8, so 48 each. Then, from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, 48 + 1 = 49 for both. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n- 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 full centuries. Each contributes 10 4's and 10 8's, so 4*10=40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449 (10 numbers) and 8 for 480-488 (9 numbers). So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each 10 consecutive numbers contain one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 each.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) add one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - Total: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each 100 numbers have 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - 4 complete hundreds contribute 40 each.\n   - The remaining 88 numbers (401-488) add 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number, right? So from page 1 to page 488, the numbers go from 1 up to 488.\n\nI guess I should start by figuring out how many times the digit 4 appears in each position: units, tens, and hundreds. Similarly, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can compare the total counts of 4's and 8's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4. I'll check each digit position one by one.\n\n1. **Units place**: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets and then an extra 8 pages. Each set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, in the extra 8 pages (from 481 to 488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which adds another 4. So that's 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\nWait, no, maybe I should think differently. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, which means 48 full cycles and then 8 extra numbers. In each cycle, 4 appears once, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial cycle (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (at 484). So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place**: Now, for the tens digit. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are up to 488.\n\nFrom 1-488, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. Wait, but page numbers start at 1, so 0 isn't used. So, the blocks are:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10\n- 240-249: 10\n- 340-349: 10\n- 440-449: 10\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So 5 * 10 = 50 times.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check if 440-449 is fully included. Since 449 is less than 488, yes, it's fully included. So 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: Now, the hundreds digit. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times.\n\nWait, but wait, no. Wait, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, but the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So 89 times.\n\nSo total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nWait, let me add again: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So total 4's are 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place**: Similar to 4's, in the units place, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which is another 8. So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place**: Now, 8 in the tens place. This happens in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers instead of 10.\n\nSo each full block contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's count how many full blocks there are.\n\n- 80-89: 10\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9\n\nSo that's 4 full blocks contributing 10 each, and one partial block contributing 9. So total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that. 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9. So 4*10 + 9 = 49. Yes, that's correct.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: Now, 8 in the hundreds place. This would be from page 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So 0 times.\n\nSo total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, let me add again: 49 + 49 is 98. So total 8's are 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So subtract the total 8's from total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 4's. I said there are 5 blocks of 100 where 4 appears in the tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each contributes 10, so 5*10=50. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, I have 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, and 480-488 contributing 9, so 4*10 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages. So 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 48 full sets of 10, plus 1 in 484, total 49. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 8's: 48 full sets, plus 1 in 488, total 49. Correct.\n\nTens place for 4's: 50, as calculated. Tens place for 8's: 49.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number, right? Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI guess I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are. That makes sense. \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll need to check each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, the units place. In every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, etc. So from 1 to 488, how many such blocks are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then an extra 8 numbers. In each of those 48 blocks, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the extra 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digit is 1 through 8, so 4 doesn't appear there. So total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for a block of 10 numbers every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds and then 88 extra pages. In each of the 4 hundreds, there's one block of 10 where the tens digit is 4, contributing 10 each, so that's 4*10=40. Now, in the extra 88 pages (from 400 to 488), the tens digit is 0-8. So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 occurrences. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So total for tens place is 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but wait, 488 is less than 500, so from 400 to 488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So yes, that's 10 more. So total tens place 4's are 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the hundreds digit is 4 in all these 89 numbers, contributing 89 occurrences of the digit 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So there are 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4's, in every block of 10, 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, that's 48 complete blocks and an extra 8 numbers. So 48 times in the units place. In the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once (at 488). So total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each such block contributes 10 occurrences. How many such blocks are there in 488? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds. Each contributes 10, so 4*10=40. Now, in the extra 88 pages (400-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488). Wait, but from 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8, but the units digits go from 0 to 8, so that's 9 numbers. So that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, there are 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 400 to 488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences. So that's correct.\n\nSo now, the number of 4's is 187 and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, for 4's in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's. That seems right.\n\nFor 4's in the tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Wait, but earlier I thought there were 4 hundreds, but actually, from 0-400, it's 0-399, then 400-488. So maybe I should think of it as 0-488, so the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nWait, but for the tens place, the digit 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 4's in the tens place. But earlier I thought 4 blocks, but perhaps it's 5 because 440-449 is within 488. So that's 50, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, not 10. So that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, so 4*10 +9=49. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I calculated the 4's in the tens place, I had 5 blocks, each 10, so 50. So that's correct.\n\nSo total 4's: 48 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=187.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:187-98=89.\n\nHmm, but let me think again. Wait, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nWait, but when I counted the units place for 4's, I had 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digit goes from 1-8, so no 4's there. So 48 units place 4's.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then in the last partial block, 481-488, units digits 1-8, so 8 appears once at 488. So total 48+1=49.\n\nWait, but when I calculated the 4's in the tens place, I had 50, which is correct because there are 5 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, no, actually, each hundred has one block of 10 where the tens digit is 4. So from 0-99:40-49, 100-199:140-149, 200-299:240-249, 300-399:340-349, and 400-488:440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 50. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, from 0-99:80-89, 100-199:180-189, 200-299:280-289, 300-399:380-389, and 400-488:480-488. So that's 5 blocks, but the last block is only 9 numbers because 488 is the end. So 4 blocks of 10 and one of 9, so 4*10 +9=49. So that's correct.\n\nSo, the total 4's are 187 and 8's are 98, so the difference is 89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the difference might be smaller, but maybe it's correct. Let me try another approach to verify.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately by considering each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: floor(488/10) = 48, plus if the remainder is >=4, add 1. But since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so 48 +1=49? Wait, no, wait, actually, the formula is a bit different. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N is floor((N + 1)/10) if d !=0, but I think I'm complicating it. Alternatively, for each digit place, the count is as follows.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to use the formula for digit counting.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's in units place: floor(488/10) = 48. Then, check if the units digit of 488 is >=4. Since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so add 1. So total 48 +1=49? Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is calculated as follows:\n\nFor units digit, it's floor(N/10) + (if the units digit of N is >=d, then 1 else 0).\n\nWait, but wait, actually, from 1 to N, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place is:\n\nIf d=0: floor((N-1)/10)\nElse: floor(N/10) + (if (N mod 10) >= d, 1 else 0)\n\nWait, but let me test with N=488 and d=4.\n\nfloor(488/10)=48. 488 mod 10=8. Since 8 >=4, add 1. So total 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check.\n\nWait, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So in 488 numbers, there are 48 full cycles of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once at 484? Wait, no, 484 is 484, which is within 481-488. So that's an additional 1. So total 48+1=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 48 because I thought the last partial block didn't include a 4, but actually, 484 is within 481-488, so that's correct. So the units place for 4's is 49, not 48. So I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, so let me correct that. So units place for 4's: 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place: floor(488/10)=48. 488 mod10=8, which is >=8, so add 1. So total 48+1=49. So that's correct.\n\nWait, so earlier I had 48 for 4's in units place, but it's actually 49. Hmm, so I need to adjust my previous calculations.\n\nWait, let me redo the counts with this correction.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: Let's see, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place from 1 to 488.\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9, so in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. How many hundreds are there? 488 is less than 500, so we have 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So that's 5 sets.\n\nIn each of the first four sets (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times each, so 4*10=40.\n\nIn the last set, 400-488, the tens digit is 0-8, so 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's 10 more.\n\nSo total tens place 4's:40 +10=50.\n\nNow, hundreds place: From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 187, but now it's 188. Wait, because units place was 49 instead of 48.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place: Let's calculate.\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times. So in 0-99:80-89 (10), 100-199:180-189 (10), 200-299:280-289 (10), 300-399:380-389 (10), and 400-488:480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the end).\n\nSo that's 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: As before, 0, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nSo total 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nSo now, total 4's=188, 8's=98. Difference=188-98=90.\n\nWait, but now I'm getting 90 as the difference, but earlier I thought 89. Hmm, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nWe can list them: 4,14,24,34,...,484. Wait, 484 is within 481-488, so that's the last one. So how many terms are there?\n\nThe first term is 4, and the last term is 484. The common difference is 10, so the number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So yes, 49 times. So units place 4's=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place:8,18,28,...,488. The last term is 488, which is included. So number of terms: ((488-8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So units place 8's=49.\n\nNow, tens place for 4's: As before, 50.\n\nHundreds place for 4's:89.\n\nTotal 4's=49+50+89=188.\n\nSimilarly, tens place for 8's:49.\n\nTotal 8's=49+49=98.\n\nDifference=188-98=90.\n\nWait, so earlier I had 187-98=89, but now with corrected units place for 4's, it's 188-98=90.\n\nWait, so where did I go wrong earlier? I think I initially miscalculated the units place for 4's as 48 instead of 49. So the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check again.\n\nWait, when I thought about the units place for 4's, I considered 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial cycle (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once at 484. So total 48+1=49. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, so 48, and in the last partial cycle, 488 has 8, so 48+1=49.\n\nSo, yes, units place 4's=49, 8's=49.\n\nTens place 4's=50, 8's=49.\n\nHundreds place 4's=89, 8's=0.\n\nSo total 4's=49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's=49+49=98.\n\nDifference=188-98=90.\n\nSo the correct answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference was 89, but that was due to an error in counting the units place for 4's as 48 instead of 49.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n- 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98\n- Difference=188-98=90\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Count the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** In every block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete blocks of 10, contributing 48 times. Additionally, in the last partial block (481-488), 4 appears once at 484. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens place:** In every block of 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488, each contributes 10, except the last which contributes 10 (440-449). Total: 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Total: 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Count the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears once in each block of 10. From 1-488, 48 blocks contribute 48, and in the last partial block, 488 adds one more. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens place:** In each block of 100, 8 appears 10 times. From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488, the last contributes 9 (480-488). Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488. Total: 0.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number, right? So, pages 1 to 9 are single-digit, 10 to 99 are two-digit, and 100 to 488 are three-digit numbers. \n\nI guess I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4. I'll consider each position separately.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, for 488 pages, that's 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, I think we take the integer part, so 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so actually, the units digit cycles exactly 48 times, but let me check: from 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of 10, so 48 fours in the units place. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1 to 8, so no additional 4's. So, total 48 fours in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, for the tens place, 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, each hundred has one such block. So, from 1-100, 40-49 is one block. Then 101-200, 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249 and 340-349. Now, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is another block. So, that's five blocks in total. Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check: from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, that's 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 times. But wait, let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction, it's 48 full tens, so 48 eights in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the units digit goes up to 8 on page 488. So, from 1 to 480, that's 48 eights, and from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1 to 8, so page 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's 49 eights in the units place. Wait, did I make a mistake earlier with 4's? Because for 4's, 488 didn't add an extra 4 in the units place, but for 8's, 488 does add one. So, perhaps I was wrong with the 4's count. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, when I calculated the units place for 4's, I had 48 fours because from 1 to 480, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once, and from 481 to 488, the units digits go up to 8, so no 4. But for 8's, from 481 to 488, the units digit 8 appears once on page 488. So, total eights in units place would be 48 (from 1-480) plus 1 (from 488), totaling 49. So, I think I made a mistake earlier with the 4's; maybe I should check that again.\n\nWait, no, for 4's in the units place, from 1-480, it's 48 fours, and from 481-488, units digits go up to 8, but 4 doesn't appear again. So, 48 fours in units place. But for 8's, from 1-480, it's 48 eights, and from 481-488, 488 has an 8 in units place, so 49 eights in units place.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with my initial thought. Let me think again. How many times does 8 appear in the units place from 1 to 488?\n\nEach ten's place, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-480, that's 48 times. Then, from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once on page 488. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place.\n\nSo, for 8's, units place: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, how about the tens digit being 8? Similar to 4's, each hundred has a block where the tens digit is 8. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. So, let's count these blocks.\n\nFrom 1-100: 80-89 is one block, 10 numbers, so 10 eights in the tens place.\n\nFrom 101-200: 180-189, another 10 eights.\n\nFrom 201-300: 280-289, another 10 eights.\n\nFrom 301-400: 380-389, another 10 eights.\n\nFrom 401-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9. So, in the tens place, that's 9 eights.\n\nSo, total eights in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9.\n\nSo, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8. When does that happen? From 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought for 4's, the hundreds place had 89 fours, but for 8's, hundreds place is 0. So, total eights are 98.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Did I count correctly?\n\nUnits place: 49 eights.\n\nTens place: 49 eights.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, for 4's, I had 187 fours.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 89.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot, but let me verify.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the 4's. Let me go through it again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits place: From 1-488, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 times. But page 488 has units digit 8, so no extra 4. So, 48 fours in units.\n\nTens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d710 = 50 fours.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nTotal: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 fours.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49 eights.\n\nTens place: 49 eights.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal: 98 eights.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count the units place correctly for 8's? Because from 1-480, that's 48 eights, and 488 adds one more, so 49. That seems right.\n\nAnd for the tens place, from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks is 10 numbers, so 4\u00d710=40, and the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nSo, yes, 49 + 49 = 98 eights.\n\nAnd 187 fours minus 98 eights is 89 more fours.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{89}."

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll go through each place and calculate the occurrences of 4 and 8.\n\nFirst, for the units place. In the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each set of ten numbers. For example, from 1 to 10, the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, each digit appears once every ten numbers. \n\nNow, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten and then 8 extra numbers (from 481 to 488). \n\nIn each set of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 appears once as well. So, for 48 complete sets, the number of 4's in the units place would be 48, and the same for 8's. \n\nBut wait, I have those extra 8 numbers: 481 to 488. Let me check the units digits here. The units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). So, adding these to our counts, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. \n\nHmm, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. That means there's no difference in the units place. \n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digits go from 0 (for 1-9) up to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers.\n\nSo, how many complete sets of 100 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 extra numbers (401-488). \n\nIn each complete set of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49, 140-149, etc.), and the digit 8 appears 10 times as well (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for 4 complete sets, that's 4 * 10 = 40 occurrences of 4 and 40 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's check the extra 88 numbers: 401-488. The tens digit here ranges from 0 (for 401-410) to 8 (for 480-488). So, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nFirst, for the digit 4 in the tens place: It appears in the range 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. \n\nFor the digit 8 in the tens place: It appears in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), so 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. \n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, 9 times. \n\nSo, adding these to our counts, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 40 (from the complete sets) + 10 = 50. And the number of 8's is 40 + 9 = 49. \n\nSo, in the tens place, there are 50 fours and 49 eights. That means there's one more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers 100 and above. From 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so we can ignore those. \n\nIn the hundreds place, each digit from 1 to 4 appears for 100 numbers each. For example, 100-199 have 1 in the hundreds place, 200-299 have 2, and so on up to 400-488 having 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, how many times does the digit 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, the count for 8 in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. That's a difference of 89 more 4's than 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let me summarize the counts for each place:\n\n- Units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49. Difference: 0.\n- Tens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 49. Difference: 1.\n- Hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0. Difference: 89.\n\nNow, adding up the differences: 0 (units) + 1 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the units place: 488 pages. For units digits, each digit 0-9 appears equally in each ten. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens and 8 extra. Each full ten gives one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 each. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 complete hundreds (1-400) give 4*10=40 for each digit. Then, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. For 4 in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. For 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40+10=50 for 4, 40+9=49 for 8. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times. 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book doesn't go beyond 488. So, 0 for 8. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up the differences: units (0) + tens (1) + hundreds (89) = 90. So, 4's appear 90 more times than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The hundreds place for 4 is from 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, 89 fours. The tens place for 4 is 50, units is 49. So total fours: 89 + 50 + 49 = 188.\n\nFor 8's: hundreds place is 0, tens place is 49, units place is 49. So, total eights: 0 + 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. Let me recount the fours and eights separately to make sure.\n\nTotal fours:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal eights:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because I might have miscounted the tens place for the 401-488 range. Let me check that again.\n\nFrom 401-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's in 440-449, which is 10 numbers: 440, 441,...,449. So, 10 times. That's correct.\n\nAnd 8 in the tens place is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 times. Correct.\n\nSo, the counts for the tens place are correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, which is correct because from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers.\n\nTherefore, the total difference is indeed 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Count the number of '4's and '8's in each digit place (units, tens, hundreds):**\n\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n     - Total complete sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 sets.\n     - Each set contributes 1 '4' and 1 '8' in the units place.\n     - Partial set (481-488): '4' appears once (484), '8' appears once (488).\n     - Total '4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n     - Total '8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n     - Complete sets of 100 in 488 pages: 4 sets.\n     - Each set contributes 10 '4's and 10 '8's in the tens place.\n     - Partial set (401-488): '4' appears 10 times (440-449), '8' appears 9 times (480-488).\n     - Total '4's in tens place: 4*10 + 10 = 50.\n     - Total '8's in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - '4' appears in page numbers 400-488, which is 89 times.\n     - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n     - Total '4's in hundreds place: 89.\n     - Total '8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\n2. **Sum the counts for each digit:**\n   - Total '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - Total '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - Difference = Total '4's - Total '8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number is a three-digit number, right? From 1 to 488. So, the pages go from 001 to 488, but since leading zeros aren't actually printed, I need to be careful with how I count the digits.\n\nWait, no, actually, page numbers don't have leading zeros. So page 1 is just '1', page 10 is '10', page 100 is '100', and so on. So, the digits are only as many as needed. That means I can't just count all three-digit numbers because some pages are one or two digits. Maybe I should think of each page number as a three-digit number with leading zeros, but without actually printing them, just for counting purposes. So, pages 1 to 9 would be 001 to 009, pages 10 to 99 would be 010 to 099, and pages 100 to 488 would be 100 to 488. That way, I can analyze each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nAlright, so I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each place (units, tens, hundreds) and then do the same for the digit 8. Then, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's in each position.\n\nFirst, the units place. In the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, every 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. Now, how many full groups of 10 are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. So, in each full group, there's one 4 in the units place, so 48 times 1 is 48. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (from 481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so there's one more 4 (at 484). So total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me check that again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The first term is 4, the last term is 484, and the common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, the digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many full hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), and then 88 pages in the next hundred (400-488). So, in each full hundred, there are 10 4's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds times 10 is 40.\n\nNow, in the partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 in the range 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 more 4's. Therefore, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, let me verify that. From 0-99: 40-49, that's 10. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 10. 300-399: 340-349, 10. Then 400-488: 440-449, which is 10. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. Yep, that's correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. Therefore, the number of 4's in the hundreds place is 89.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Each page number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4. So, from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many 8's in the units place?\n\nAgain, using the same approach. The first 8 is at 8, then 18, 28,..., 488. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, let's see: the sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms?\n\nThe first term is 8, the last term is 488, common difference 10. So, number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place.\n\nWait, but hold on. 488 is included, so 488 is the last term, which is correct. So, 49 8's in the units place.\n\nNow, moving to the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let me check each.\n\nFrom 0-99: 80-89, that's 10 numbers. So, 10 8's.\n\nFrom 100-199: 180-189, another 10.\n\nFrom 200-299: 280-289, another 10.\n\nFrom 300-399: 380-389, another 10.\n\nFrom 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. Wait, no: 480 is the first, then 481, up to 488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 +1 =9.\n\nWait, let me check: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, how many 8's? Each of these numbers has an 8 in the tens place, so 9 8's.\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. From 0-99: 10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, and 400-488:9. So, 10*4 +9=49. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's there.\n\nTherefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. So, 98 8's in total.\n\nWait, but hold on, I think I might have made a mistake in the units place for 8's. Let me check again.\n\nIn the units place, we have 8,18,28,...,488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10 each time. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, we have 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct too.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nNow, total 4's were 188, and total 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct.\n\n8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in the hundreds place for 4's? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's there. That seems right.\n\nAnd for the tens place of 4's, I had 50, which came from 4 blocks of 100 each contributing 10, and then the last partial block contributing another 10. So, 4*10 +10=50. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the units place of 4's, 49, as every 10 numbers contribute one 4, and the last partial set contributes one more.\n\nFor 8's, same approach, but in the tens place, the last partial block only had 9 numbers instead of 10, so 9 instead of 10.\n\nSo, yeah, 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I missed any 8's in the hundreds place. Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so no 8's there. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the hundreds place, only from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 4's there.\n\nWait, but let me think about the tens place for 8's again. From 480-488, that's 9 numbers, right? Because 480 is the first, 481, 482,...,488. That's 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, 9 8's there. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number, right? Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, I'll need to look at each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nLet me start by thinking about the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each set of 10, there's one 4 and one 8. But wait, since the book goes up to 488, I need to figure out how many complete sets of 10 there are and then check if there's an incomplete set at the end.\n\nSo, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 more pages (481 to 488). In each complete set of 10, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 sets, that's 48 fours and 48 eights. Now, looking at the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in these, there's one 4 and one 8. So, adding that, the total units place fours are 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for eights: 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, the number of 4's and 8's is equal. Hmm, so no difference there.\n\nNext, I should consider the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, in each hundred, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. So, for 488 pages, how many hundreds are there? Well, 488 is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nIn each full hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and the digit 8 appears 10 times (80-89). So, for 4 full hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 fours and 4*10 = 40 eights.\n\nNow, looking at the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). Wait, 480-488 is actually 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit here is 8 for pages 480-488, which is 9 times. So, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears 9 more times. The digit 4 in the tens place in this last partial hundred would be from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 fours. Wait, but 488 is less than 490, so does 440-449 fall within 401-488? Yes, because 440 is greater than 401 and less than 488. So, that's 10 fours. So, in the tens place, the fours are 40 (from the four full hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50 fours. The eights are 40 (from four full hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49 eights. So, in the tens place, there are 50 fours and 49 eights, meaning there's one more four than eight in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Each full hundred has 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 40 fours and 40 eights. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times, so that's 10 fours. The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page, so 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, yes, 10 fours and 9 eights in the tens place of the last partial hundred. So total fours in tens place: 40 +10=50, eights:40 +9=49. So, 50 fours vs 49 eights, so one more four.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, which we can ignore since we're only counting 4's and 8's. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299 is 2; 300-399 is 3; 400-488 is 4.\n\nSo, how many times does each hundreds digit appear? Let's see:\n\n- 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's here.\n- 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, again no 4's or 8's.\n- 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, same thing.\n- 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so every page from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4. So, how many pages is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, we have 89 fours and 0 eights. That's a significant difference.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each digit place.\n\nFirst, units place: 49 fours and 49 eights.\n\nTens place: 50 fours and 49 eights.\n\nHundreds place: 89 fours and 0 eights.\n\nSo, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate that. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 488 pages. Each 10 pages, one 4 and one 8 in units. 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1 four and 1 eight. So, 48 fours and 48 eights. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so one 4 and one 8. So, total units fours:48 +1=49, same for eights:49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each full hundred has 10 fours and 10 eights in tens place. 4 full hundreds: 4*10=40 fours and 40 eights. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449 (10 fours) and 8 for 480-488 (9 eights). So, tens fours:40 +10=50, tens eights:40 +9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 pages, so 89 fours. No eights in hundreds place. So, hundreds fours:89, hundreds eights:0.\n\nAdding up: fours:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188. Eights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98. Difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems right because each of those pages has a 4 in the hundreds digit.\n\nIs there any other place where 8's could appear? No, because the hundreds digit only goes up to 4, so 8 never appears there. So, eights only come from units and tens places.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, from 480-488, that's 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place:40 (from four full hundreds) +9=49. Units place:49, so total eights:98.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, fours are 188, eights are 98, so 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 -400 +1 =89 pages. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: Each page from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 fours right there. Then, in the tens and units places, we have additional fours and eights.\n\nWait, but let me check if I added correctly: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188 fours. 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98 eights. So, 188 -98=90. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place Analysis:**\n   - Each 10 pages contribute one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488 pages, contributing 48 fours and 48 eights.\n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) add one more 4 and one more 8.\n   - **Total Units Place:** 49 fours, 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens Place Analysis:**\n   - Each 100 pages contribute 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place.\n   - Four complete hundreds contribute 40 fours and 40 eights.\n   - The last 88 pages (401-488) add 10 fours (440-449) and 9 eights (480-488).\n   - **Total Tens Place:** 50 fours, 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place Analysis:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n   - No eights appear in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total Hundreds Place:** 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\n4. **Summing Up:**\n   - **Total Fours:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **Total Eights:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n   - **Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number, right? So, pages 1 to 9 are single-digit, 10 to 99 are two-digit, and 100 to 488 are three-digit numbers.\n\nI guess I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Because the digits can appear in any of these places, I need to calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, every 10 numbers, the digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times a specific digit appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10.\n\nWait, but since 488 isn't a multiple of 10, I should adjust for that. Let me see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10 pages and then 8 extra pages. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times for the full sets, and then in the last 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digit is 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once more in 484. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, it also appears 48 times in the full sets, and in the last 8 pages, 8 appears once in 488. So, units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that seems equal. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake because 488 is the last page, so the units digit 8 only appears once in the last set. Let me check again. From 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of 10, so 48 times each digit appears in the units place. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So yes, both 4 and 8 have 49 occurrences in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers, right? Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, same with 8.\n\nLet's calculate how many hundreds we have. 488 pages mean 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nSo, for each of the 4 hundreds, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40 times. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times in each hundred, so 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? From 440 to 449, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place from 480 to 488, but wait, 480 to 488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481,...,488), so the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. Wait, but 480 is included, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 times.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, right? So, 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 times. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in the last partial hundred.\n\nSimilarly, 4 appears in the tens place from 440 to 449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's are 40 (from the full hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50.\n\nTens place 8's are 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times.\n\nNow, onto the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, pages 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit, so we can ignore them for the hundreds place.\n\nFrom page 100 to 488, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, for the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n\nWait, but 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8's in the hundreds place are 0 times.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49\n- Tens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 49\n- Hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0\n\nNow, let's add them up.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 49 for both 4 and 8, which seems correct. Then in the tens place, 4's were 50 and 8's were 49. So, 4's have 50 vs 8's 49. Then in hundreds place, 4's have 89, 8's have 0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me double-check the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those, so 89 times. That seems right.\n\nIn the tens place, I had 4's appearing 50 times and 8's 49 times. That's because in the last partial hundred, 480-488, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place, whereas in the full hundreds, it was 10 times each, so 4 *10 = 40, plus 9, so 49. For 4's, in the last partial hundred, 440-449 is 10 times, so 40 +10=50. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 full sets of 10, so 48 times each, plus 484 and 488, so 49 each. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, 188 4's and 98 8's, so 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. Yes.\n\nAnd 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only has 488 pages, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, 8's in hundreds place are zero.\n\nSo, the total 4's are 188, and 8's are 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total full sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48.\n   - '4' appears 48 times in the units place.\n   - '8' appears 48 times in the units place.\n   - In the last 8 pages (481-488), '4' appears once (484) and '8' appears once (488).\n   - Total: '4' = 49, '8' = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Full hundreds (1-400): 4 sets, so '4' and '8' each appear 40 times.\n   - Last partial hundred (401-488):\n     - '4' appears 10 times (440-449).\n     - '8' appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total: '4' = 50, '8' = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 1-99: No hundreds digit.\n   - Pages 400-488: '4' appears 89 times.\n   - '8' never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: '4' = 89, '8' = 0.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, pages 1 to 9 are single-digit, 10 to 99 are two-digit, and 100 to 488 are three-digit numbers.\n\nI guess I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4. I'll go through each position one by one.\n\n1. **Units place for 4:**\n   - In the units place, the digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 10, 4 appears once (page 4). Then from 11 to 20, it's page 14, and so on.\n   - Since the book has 488 pages, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete groups and then 8 extra pages.\n   - In each group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 groups mean 48 times. Plus, in the last partial group (pages 481 to 488), does the units digit reach 4? Yes, page 484. So that's one more.\n   - So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place for 4:**\n   - Now, looking at the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for a range of 10 numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - How many such ranges are there in 488 pages?\n   - From 1-99: 40-49 is one set, so 10 numbers. That's 10 times.\n   - From 100-199: 140-149, another 10.\n   - From 200-299: 240-249, another 10.\n   - From 300-399: 340-349, another 10.\n   - From 400-488: 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10.\n   - Wait, let me count: 1-99 has one set, 100-199 another, 200-299 another, 300-399 another, and 400-488 another. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place.\n   - So total tens place 4's: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place for 4:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400 to 488. So, how many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages.\n   - Each of these pages has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNext, I need to do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place for 8:**\n   - Similar to the 4's in the units place, each group of 10 has one 8. So, 488 pages mean 48 complete groups and 8 extra pages.\n   - In each group, 8 appears once, so 48 times. In the last partial group (481-488), page 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more.\n   - So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place for 8:**\n   - The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Let's count the sets:\n     - 1-99: 80-89, 10 numbers. So 10 8's.\n     - 100-199: 180-189, another 10.\n     - 200-299: 280-289, another 10.\n     - 300-399: 380-389, another 10.\n     - 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here because from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers.\n   - So, the first four sets give 10 each, and the last set gives 9.\n   - Total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place for 8:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only in pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no pages where the hundreds digit is 8.\n   - So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, but wait, when I counted the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers. Let me confirm that. From 480 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So yes, 9 times the digit 8 in the tens place there. So that part is correct.\n\nAnother thing to check: when counting the units place for 4, I had 48 groups of 10, each contributing one 4, and then one more in the last partial group (page 484). So 49 in units place. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly for 8's in units place, same logic: 49.\n\nFor the tens place of 4, I had 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's. Let me list them again:\n- 40-49: 10\n- 140-149: 10\n- 240-249: 10\n- 340-349: 10\n- 440-449: 10\nYes, that's 5 sets, so 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but from 440-449, that's within 488, so that's fine. So 50 is correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nI think my counts are correct. So the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I missed any 8's in the hundreds place. Since the book only goes up to 488, pages 800-899 don't exist, so no 8's in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nWait another thing: when counting the tens place for 4's, I included 440-449 as a set, which is correct because 449 is less than 488. So that's fine.\n\nI think I've covered all the cases. So the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** In every 10 numbers, '4' appears once. There are 48 complete groups of 10 (480 pages) and 8 extra pages. The last group includes page 484, so total units place '4's = 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens place:** '4' appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), each contributing 10 '4's, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** '4' appears in pages 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n\n   **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to '4's, '8' appears once every 10 numbers. Total units place '8's = 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens place:** '8' appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last range (480-488) contributes 9. Total tens place '8's = 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No pages have '8' in the hundreds place.\n\n   **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

For each place, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears and how many times 8 appears. Then, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, in every block of 10 pages, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, for each complete block of 10, there's one 4 and one 8.

So, for 48 blocks, that's 48 times 1, which is 48 fours and 48 eights. Now, the remaining 8 pages are from 481 to 488. Let me check the units digits in these: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So, in the units place, there's one more 4 (page 484) and one more 8 (page 488). Therefore, the units place contributes 48 + 1 = 49 fours and 48 + 1 = 49 eights. Wait, that can't be right because the problem says there are more 4's than 8's, so maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me think again. The units digits from 1 to 488: for each 10 pages, there's one 4 and one 8. So, for 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20,...,471-480), that's 48 fours and 48 eights. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in this partial block, there's one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So, total units fours: 48 + 1 = 49, units eights: 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place: 49 fours and 49 eights. Hmm, so the units place doesn't contribute to the difference. Let me move on to the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, the digits cycle every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, ..., 9 for 90-99. Each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, from 101-200, the tens digits cycle again, and so on.\n\nSo, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. Now, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). Wait, no, 400-488 is 89 pages, but let me check: 400 to 488 is 89 pages because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. Wait, but maybe it's better to think in terms of how many full hundreds and then the remaining.\n\nWait, actually, each hundred block is 100 pages. So, 400 pages would be four hundreds, and then 88 pages beyond that. So, from 1-400, there are four hundreds. Then, from 401-488, that's 88 pages.\n\nSo, for the tens place, in each hundred, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the digit 8 appears 10 times as well. Therefore, for four hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 fours and 40 eights.\n\nNow, what about the remaining 88 pages from 401-488? Let's break it down. The tens digits in 401-488 go from 0 to 8. Let me list them:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so from 481-488, that's 8 pages, right? So, the tens digit in 481-488 is 8, appearing 8 times? Wait, no, because 481-488 is 8 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so 8 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: 481 to 488 is 8 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for each of these 8 pages. So, in the tens place, how many 4's and 8's are there in 401-488?\n\nLooking at each block:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0, no 4's or 8's\n- 411-420: tens digit 1, no 4's or 8's\n- 421-430: tens digit 2, no 4's or 8's\n- 431-440: tens digit 3, no 4's or 8's\n- 441-450: tens digit 4, so 10 pages, so 10 fours\n- 451-460: tens digit 5, no 4's or 8's\n- 461-470: tens digit 6, no 4's or 8's\n- 471-480: tens digit 7, no 4's or 8's\n- 481-488: tens digit 8, 8 pages, so 8 eights\n\nWait, but 441-450 is 10 pages, so tens digit 4 appears 10 times. Similarly, 481-488 is 8 pages, so tens digit 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, in the 401-488 range, the tens place contributes 10 fours and 8 eights.\n\nTherefore, total tens fours: 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 10 = 50 fours\nTotal tens eights: 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 8 = 48 eights\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because from 401-488, the tens digits beyond 400 would be part of the fifth hundred? Wait, no, 401-500 would be the fifth hundred, but our book ends at 488, so it's only part of the fifth hundred.\n\nWait, but in the first four hundreds (1-400), each hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40 each.\n\nThen, from 401-488, as calculated, tens fours: 10, tens eights:8.\n\nSo, total tens fours:40 +10=50\nTotal tens eights:40 +8=48\n\nSo, in the tens place, there are 50 fours and 48 eights.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, so 89 fours.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, hundreds fours:89, hundreds eights:0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the fours and eights across units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nUnits place:\nFours:49\nEights:49\n\nTens place:\nFours:50\nEights:48\n\nHundreds place:\nFours:89\nEights:0\n\nTotal fours:49 +50 +89= 188\nTotal eights:49 +48 +0=97\n\nWait, so 188 fours and 97 eights. The difference would be 188 -97=91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: For each 10 pages, one 4 and one 8. 488 pages mean 48 full tens and 8 extra pages. So, 48 fours and 48 eights from the full tens. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, one 4 and one 8. So, units fours:48+1=49, units eights:48+1=49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights. Four hundreds (1-400) give 40 fours and 40 eights. Then, from 401-488, the tens digits are as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0\n- 411-420: tens digit 1\n- 421-430: tens digit 2\n- 431-440: tens digit 3\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 pages)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5\n- 461-470: tens digit 6\n- 471-480: tens digit 7\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 pages)\n\nSo, in 401-488, tens fours:10, tens eights:8. So, total tens fours:40+10=50, tens eights:40+8=48. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 pages. So, 89 fours. No eights in hundreds place, so 0.\n\nAdding up:\n\nFours:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\nEights:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe the units place would have more fours, but it seems that in units and tens, they were almost equal, but the hundreds place skewed it because of the 4's.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages where the hundreds digit is 4, so 89 fours. But wait, 488-400=88, so 88 pages, but since we include both endpoints, it's 89 pages. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check another way: how many times does 4 appear in each digit place.\n\nUnits place:49\nTens place:50\nHundreds place:89\nTotal:49+50+89=188\n\nEights:\n\nUnits place:49\nTens place:48\nHundreds place:0\nTotal:49+48=97\n\nSo, 188-97=91.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any 8's in the hundreds place. Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can only be 1,2,3,4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights there.\n\nWait, another thought: when I was calculating the tens place in 401-488, I considered that 481-488 has 8 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 pages. But wait, 481-488 is 8 pages: 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, 8 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for each of these, so 8 times. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, 441-450 is 10 pages, so tens digit 4 appears 10 times.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct.\n\nThus, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97, so the difference is 91. Therefore, there are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - 488 pages = 48 full decades + 8 extra pages.\n   - Fours: 48 (from decades) + 1 (from 484) = 49.\n   - Eights: 48 (from decades) + 1 (from 488) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - 400 pages = 4 full hundreds.\n   - Fours: 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - Eights: 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - From 401-488:\n     - Tens digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450).\n     - Tens digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n   - Total Fours: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total Eights: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - Hundreds digit 4 appears from 400-488 (89 pages).\n   - Fours: 89.\n   - Eights: 0.\n\n**Total Counts**:\n- Fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- Eights: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n**Difference**: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number, right? Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. That means the page numbers can be 1-digit (1-9), 2-digit (10-99), or 3-digit (100-488).\n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in a complete set of numbers. But since we're only going up to 488, I need to be careful about the last few numbers.\n\nFirst, for the units digit, how many times does 4 appear? Well, every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So from 1 to 480, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 480 divided by 10 is 48. So that's 48 times. But wait, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear again in the units place here. So total 4's in units place: 48.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place: from 1 to 480, 480 divided by 10 is 48, so 48 times. Then from 481 to 488, the units digit 8 appears once at 488. So total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but hold on, when I count from 1 to 480, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place, right? So 8 appears 48 times, and then in 488, it's another 8, so 49 total. That seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, from 1 to 400, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Well, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So that's 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n\nWait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, but 450-488 is beyond 449. So actually, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 50 times. So 4's in the tens place: 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place: from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place here? From 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so the tens digit is 8 for all these, right? So each of these blocks contributes 10 8's except the last one, which contributes 9 because we stop at 488.\n\nWait, let me think again. From 1 to 488, the tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, so 10 times each, and the last block (480-488) has 9 numbers. So total 8's in the tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total 10+10+10+10+9=49. So 8's in the tens place:49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So 8's in the hundreds place:0.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place:48\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's:48+50=98, 98+89=187.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187-98=89.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- 4's: From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full times, but since 488 is included, does that add another 4? Wait, 488's units digit is 8, so no. So units place 4's:48.\n\n- 8's: Similarly, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. From 1-480, that's 48 times. Then 488 has another 8, so 49 total.\n\nTens place:\n- 4's: From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d710=50. Correct.\n\n- 8's: From 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks are 10 each, and the last block is 9. So 4\u00d710+9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Correct.\n\n- 8's: No 8's in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo total 4's:48+50+89=187.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:187-98=89.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So the answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number, right? So, pages 1 to 9 are single-digit, 10 to 99 are two-digit, and 100 to 488 are three-digit numbers. \n\nI guess I should count the number of times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4. \n\nFirst, the units place: For every 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from page 1 to page 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, it's 48 complete sets. Each set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, does the 48th set end at 480, so the 489th page would be beyond the book's pages. So, actually, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 times, each time adding a 4 once. So, 48 fours in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive pages every 100 pages. For example, pages 40-49 have 4 in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds. Each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 times 10 is 40. But wait, the last hundred is from 400 to 488. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for pages 400-409, which is 10 pages. So, that's another 10 fours. So, total tens place fours would be 40 + 10 = 50? Wait, no, because from 1-100, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each of these hundreds has a block where the tens digit is 4, contributing 10 each, so that's 4 blocks times 10, which is 40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for pages 400-409, which is 10 pages, so adding another 10. So, total tens place fours would be 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is actually 89 pages, right? So, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only from 400-409, which is 10 pages, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. So, how many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, but the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, every 10 pages, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, so 48 eights in the units place.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive pages every 100 pages, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds. Each contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 times 10 is 40. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 9 pages: 480-488. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights would be 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that. From 1-400, each hundred has a block where the tens digit is 8, contributing 10 eights each. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) would have 4 blocks, each with 10 eights, so 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488), so 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book is only 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total eights: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, total fours are 187, and total eights are 97. So, 187 - 97 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFor fours:\n- Units: 48 (since 488/10 = 48.8, so 48 times)\n- Tens: 50 (40 from the first four hundreds, 10 from 400-409)\n- Hundreds: 89 (pages 400-488)\nTotal fours: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\nFor eights:\n- Units: 48 (same as fours)\n- Tens: 40 (from first four hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal eights: 48 + 49 = 97\n\nDifference: 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** For every 10 pages, '4' appears once. There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488 pages, so 48 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** '4' appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive pages (e.g., 40-49) every 100 pages. There are 4 complete hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10 '4's, totaling 40. Additionally, in 400-488, '4' appears in the tens place for 10 pages (400-409), adding 10 more. Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** '4' appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total '4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to '4', '8' appears once every 10 pages, totaling 48 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** '8' appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive pages every 100 pages. There are 4 complete hundreds, contributing 40 '8's. In 400-488, '8' appears in the tens place for 9 pages (480-488), adding 9. Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** '8' never appears in the hundreds place since the book has only 488 pages.\n   - **Total '8's:** 48 (units) + 49 (tens) = 97.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - More '4's than '8's: 187 (total '4's) - 97 (total '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI guess the first thing I should do is figure out how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll handle each digit position one by one for both 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So in each set of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the units digit is 4 exactly once. I need to calculate how many such sets there are up to 488.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4. So in each hundred, there are 10 occurrences. I'll need to calculate how many hundreds are there in 488 and adjust for the last partial hundred if necessary.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Wait, no, actually, 488 is included, so it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. But wait, 488 - 400 is 88, so adding 1 gives 89. Hmm, but let me check that again. 400 is the first, so 400 is 1, 401 is 2, ..., up to 488. So yes, 89 numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to the digit 8:\n\n1. **Units place:** Similarly, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So I'll calculate the number of sets of 10 up to 488.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers, like 80-89. So again, I'll calculate how many full hundreds there are and check for any partial hundreds.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So there are no page numbers from 800 onwards, so the hundreds place doesn't have any 8's.\n\nWait, actually, the hundreds digit for page numbers 1-99 is 0 (since they're two-digit numbers), but for 100-199, it's 1, and so on up to 400-488. So the hundreds digit is never 8, so no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nLet me now calculate the number of 4's:\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, so total sets of 10 are 488 / 10 = 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, we take the integer part, which is 48. Each set contributes one 4, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last number, so the 48th set would end at 480, and then we have 481-488, which is 8 more numbers. In those, the units digit 4 appears once more at 484. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me think again. For each complete set of 10, it's one 4. From 1-480, there are 48 sets of 10, so 48 times. Then from 481-488, the units digit 4 is at 484, which is one more. So total units 4's: 49.\n\nNow, tens place for 4's:\n\nThe tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4.\n\nSo how many such ranges are there up to 488?\n\nWell, each hundred has one such range (40-49, 140-149, etc.), so from 1-488, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-500, but we only go up to 488). Wait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so the last hundred is 401-488, which is part of the 400-499 range.\n\nSo in each hundred, there's one 10-number block where the tens digit is 4. So up to 400, we have 4 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349). Then from 401-488, the next block would be 440-449, which is entirely within 401-488. So that's another one. So total tens place 4's: 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 5 * 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but let me check: 40-49 is in 1-100, 140-149 in 101-200, 240-249 in 201-300, 340-349 in 301-400, and 440-449 in 401-500, but since we only go up to 488, 440-449 is still within 401-488. So yes, 5 blocks, each with 10 4's, so 50.\n\nNow, hundreds place for 4's:\n\nAs I thought earlier, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. So how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds:\n\n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems a bit high, but let me check each part.\n\nWait, units: 48 full sets of 10 up to 480, which is 48, plus one more at 484, so 49. That seems right.\n\nTens: 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10, so 50. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds: 89 numbers from 400-488, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89. That's correct.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, moving on to 8's:\n\nSimilarly, I'll calculate the number of 8's in units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nUnits place for 8's:\n\nSame as 4's, every 10 numbers, so total sets of 10 up to 488.\n\n488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. Then, in the last partial set 481-488, the units digit 8 is at 488. So that's one more. So total units 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait: 488 is the last page, so in 481-488, the units digit 8 is at 488, which is the last number. So yes, that's one more. So 49.\n\nTens place for 8's:\n\nThe tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but we don't go up to 489, only 488. So how many full tens blocks with 8 in the tens place do we have?\n\nEach hundred has one such block: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489 (but only up to 488). So how many full blocks are there?\n\nFrom 1-488, the blocks are:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nWait, so the last block is only 9 numbers, from 480 to 488, inclusive. So that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So in terms of the tens place, each of these blocks contributes 10 8's except the last one, which contributes 9.\n\nSo total tens place 8's: 4 blocks with 10 each, and 1 block with 9. So 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So 4*10 + 9 = 49. So total tens place 8's: 49.\n\nWait, but wait, when we count the tens digit, each number in 80-89 has an 8 in the tens place, so 10 numbers, each contributing one 8. Similarly for the other blocks. So yes, 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, so 49.\n\nHundreds place for 8's:\n\nAs I thought earlier, the hundreds digit can't be 8 because the book only goes up to 488. So the hundreds digits are 1, 2, 3, or 4. So no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units + tens:\n\n49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 49 + 49 is 98. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. Each block of 100 has one block where the tens digit is 8, except the last hundred, which only goes up to 488. So in 1-400, we have four such blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each contributes 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSo total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So we subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's.\n\nNumber of 4's: 188\nNumber of 8's: 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations.\n\nWait, let me go back through each step.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. But let me check again.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89 is correct.\n\nIn the tens place for 4's, we had 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each contributes 10, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 48 full sets of 10 up to 480, plus one more at 484, so 49. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full sets of 10 up to 480, plus one more at 488, so 49. Correct.\n\nTens place for 8's: 4 blocks of 10 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10, so 40. Plus the last block 480-488, which is 9 numbers, contributing 9. So 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nSo yes, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit surprised it's 90. Let me think if there's another way to approach this, maybe using a formula or a different counting method.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider each digit position separately and calculate the number of times each digit appears.\n\nFor the units digit:\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is given by:\n\nunits = (n // 10) + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place:\n\ntens = (n // 100) * 10 + min(max(n % 100 - 10*d + 1, 0), 10)\n\nAnd for the hundreds place:\n\nhundreds = (n // 1000) * 100 + min(max(n % 1000 - 100*d + 1, 0), 100)\n\nBut since n is 488, which is less than 1000, the hundreds place for 4's is 89, as calculated before.\n\nWait, maybe I can use this formula to cross-verify.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits place:\n\nn = 488\n\nunits_4 = (488 // 10) + (1 if (488 % 10) >= 4 else 0)\n= 48 + (1 if 8 >= 4 else 0)\n= 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\ntens_4 = (488 // 100) * 10 + min(max(488 % 100 - 10*4 + 1, 0), 10)\n= 4 * 10 + min(max(88 - 40 + 1, 0), 10)\n= 40 + min(max(49, 0), 10)\n= 40 + 10 = 50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nhundreds_4 = (488 // 1000) * 100 + min(max(488 % 1000 - 100*4 + 1, 0), 100)\n= 0 + min(max(488 - 400 + 1, 0), 100)\n= min(89, 100) = 89. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place:\n\nunits_8 = (488 // 10) + (1 if (488 % 10) >= 8 else 0)\n= 48 + (1 if 8 >= 8 else 0)\n= 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\ntens_8 = (488 // 100) * 10 + min(max(488 % 100 - 10*8 + 1, 0), 10)\n= 4 * 10 + min(max(88 - 80 + 1, 0), 10)\n= 40 + min(max(9, 0), 10)\n= 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nhundreds_8 = (488 // 1000) * 100 + min(max(488 % 1000 - 100*8 + 1, 0), 100)\n= 0 + min(max(488 - 800 + 1, 0), 100)\n= min(max(-311, 0), 100)\n= 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo yes, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Count the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 48 full sets of 10 (480 numbers) contribute 48 fours. The last partial set (481-488) adds one more (484), totaling 49.\n   - **Tens place:** Five blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449) each contribute 10 fours, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** Numbers 400-488 contribute 89 fours.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Count the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 48 full sets of 10 contribute 48 eights. The last partial set adds one more (488), totaling 49.\n   - **Tens place:** Four full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 40 eights. The last partial block (480-488) contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** None, as the book doesn't reach 800.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI guess the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll handle each place for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:** The digits cycle every 10 numbers. So in every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. To find how many times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full blocks and 8 extra numbers. Each block contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digit cycles from 1 to 8. So 4 appears once more in the units place. So total for units place is 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each block of 100 has 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 4 full hundreds in 488 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 times. So that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, the last partial hundred is 401-488. In this range, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so up to 488. The tens digit is 8 for 481-488, but we're looking for 4 in the tens place, which would be 440-449. So in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449). So total for tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the places for 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check again. Hmm, in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488 is indeed 89 numbers, so 89 times. For the tens place, each hundred has 10 times, so 4 hundreds give 40, plus 10 in 401-488, so 50 total. Units place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, plus one more in 481-488, so 49. So total 89 + 50 + 49 = 188. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. So 488 divided by 10 is 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, the last partial block is 481-488, where the units digit goes up to 8, so 8 appears once more. So total units place for 8 is 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each block of 100 has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are 4 full hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. So that's 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, but actually, 480 has tens digit 8? Wait, 480 is 4 8 0, so yes, tens digit is 8. So from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So that's 9 more times. So total for tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, each 100 has 10 times, so 400-499 would have 10 in the tens place for 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So yes, 9 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So that's 0 times.\n\nAdding up for 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8. In 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So that's correct. So total for 8 is 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier for 4, I had 188 times, and for 8, 98 times. So the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me check the hundreds place for 4 again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct.\n\nFor 8, the hundreds place is 0, so that's correct.\n\nUnits place for both digits: 49 each, correct.\n\nTens place: 50 for 4, 49 for 8. Wait, why is it 50 for 4? Because in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10, plus 40 from the full hundreds, so 50. For 8, in 401-488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9, plus 40 from full hundreds, so 49.\n\nSo yes, 50 for 4 in tens place, 49 for 8.\n\nSo total for 4: 89 (hundreds) + 50 (tens) + 49 (units) = 188.\n\nTotal for 8: 0 (hundreds) + 49 (tens) + 49 (units) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in the tens place for 8? Because in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers. But does 480 count as part of the last partial hundred? Yes, because 480 is within 401-488. So that's correct.\n\nAnother way to check: Let's think about how many times 8 appears in each digit place up to 488.\n\nUnits place: For each 10 numbers, 8 appears once. So 488 / 10 = 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial ten (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so that's one more 8. So 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For each 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So 400-488 is the last partial hundred. In each full hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.), there are 10 times. So 4 full hundreds give 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So total tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: As before, 0.\n\nSo 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSimilarly, for 4:\n\nUnits place: 488 / 10 = 48 full tens, each with one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial ten (481-488), units digit 4 appears once. So 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: Each 100 has 10 times 4 in the tens place. 4 full hundreds give 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89.\n\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nSo 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for 4 is 89, but when I think about it, 400-488 is indeed 89 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nSo the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting Digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full tens (48 occurrences) + 1 in the last partial ten (481-488) = 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 full hundreds (40) + 10 in 440-449 = 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 numbers (400-488) = 89.\n- **Total for 4:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting Digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full tens (48) + 1 in the last partial ten = 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 full hundreds (40) + 9 in 480-488 = 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 0.\n- **Total for 8:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI guess I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for the digit 8. Then, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense.\n\nStarting with the digit 4, let me think about each place value separately.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. How many such numbers are there? Well, since the book has 488 pages, the last page with a 4 in the units place is 484. So, from 1 to 484, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? \n\nI can calculate this by dividing 484 by 10, which gives 48.4, but since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 484 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me check: 4,14,24,...,484. So, starting from 4, each step is 10. The number of terms can be calculated as ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of ten numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there?\n\nSince the book goes up to 488, the last block would be 440-449. Let's see: 40-49 is the first block, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n\nWait a second, but does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, all 5 blocks are within the range. So, 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the occurrences of 4 in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4, the digit 8 appears once every ten numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is included, right? So, let's calculate how many times 8 appears in the units place.\n\nUsing the same method: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let me check each block:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n- 180-189: 10 occurrences.\n- 280-289: 10 occurrences.\n- 380-389: 10 occurrences.\n- 480-488: How many numbers? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nAdding these up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers from 800 to 899. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that's 98 times. So, 8 appears 98 times.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8 again. The last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences. So, 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, totaling 49. That seems right.\n\nAnd for 4's, in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, so 89 occurrences. That seems correct.\n\nI think my calculations are accurate. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488. This is 89 numbers, so 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This gives 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** No pages from 800-899 exist, so 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488.\n\nI remember that to count the number of times a specific digit appears, I can look at each digit place separately\u2014units, tens, hundreds\u2014and count how many times the digit appears in each place. So, I'll need to count how many 4's and 8's appear in the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times a specific digit appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then considering any remainder.\n\nWait, but 488 isn't a multiple of 10. The last block will be from 481 to 488, which is only 8 numbers. So, I need to adjust for that. Let me think: the total number of complete blocks of 10 is 48 (since 48*10 = 480), and then there are 8 extra pages (481-488). So, for the units place, each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times in the complete blocks, and then in the remaining 8 pages, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, digits 1-8 each appear once more in the units place, and 9 and 0 don't appear in the units place of these last 8 pages.\n\nSo, for the digit 4 in the units place: it appears 48 times in the complete blocks, and then in the last 8 pages, 484 is the only page where the units digit is 4. So that's one more time. So total 48 + 1 = 49 times 4 appears in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place: it appears 48 times in the complete blocks, and then in the last 8 pages, 488 is the only page where the units digit is 8. So that's one more time. So total 48 + 1 = 49 times 8 appears in the units place.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I did that right. Let me double-check. For each digit from 0-9, in each block of 10, they each appear once in the units place. So, for 488 pages, there are 48 complete blocks (480 pages) and 8 extra pages. So, in the units place, digits 1-8 appear once more, and 9 and 0 don't. So, for digit 4, it's 48 times plus one more in 484, making it 49. Similarly, 8 is 48 plus one in 488, so 49. So, units place: both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So, the difference in units place is zero.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit changes every 10 pages and stays the same for 10 consecutive numbers. So, for example, from 1-10, the tens digit is 0 or 1 (but 10 is the first page with a tens digit of 1). Wait, no, actually, the tens digit is 0 for pages 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, etc. So, each digit from 0 to 9 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive pages, except when the total number of pages isn't a multiple of 100.\n\nWait, but 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, the tens digit goes up to 8. Let me think about how many times each digit appears in the tens place.\n\nEach digit from 0 to 9 appears in the tens place for 10 pages, except when we reach the end. So, for 488 pages, the number of complete hundreds is 4 (since 4*100=400), and then we have 88 pages left. Wait, no, that's not the right way to think about it. Actually, each digit in the tens place appears 10 times for each hundred. So, for each hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.), each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 400 pages, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times each digit in the tens place, so 4*10=40 times each digit from 0-9 in the tens place.\n\nThen, we have 88 pages left after 400 (401-488). So, in these 88 pages, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 401-410) to 8 (for 481-488). So, each digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times in the tens place, except that the last digit, 8, only appears for 8 pages (481-488). Wait, no, because 481-488 is 8 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for those 8 pages, not 10. So, for the tens digit in the remaining 88 pages, digits 0-7 each appear 10 times (since each digit is in the tens place for 10 pages: 401-410, 411-420, etc.), but digit 8 appears only 8 times (481-488).\n\nWait, let me correct that. From 401 to 488, that's 88 pages. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. Each digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times in the tens place because each digit is present for 10 consecutive pages (e.g., 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, etc.), but the digit 8 appears only 8 times because we stop at 488. So, in the tens place, digits 0-7 each appear 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, for the tens place, the total number of times each digit appears is:\n\n- For digits 0-7: 4*10 (from the first 400 pages) + 10 (from the next 88 pages) = 50 times each.\n- For digit 8: 4*10 (from the first 400 pages) + 8 (from the next 88 pages) = 48 times.\n- For digit 9: 4*10 (from the first 400 pages) + 0 (since 488 is less than 490) = 40 times.\n\nWait, but wait, 400 pages: each hundred contributes 10 times each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 times each digit 0-9 in the tens place. Then, the remaining 88 pages: as I said, digits 0-7 each appear 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times. So, total for each digit:\n\n- 0: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 1: 40 + 10 = 50\n- ...\n- 7: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 8: 40 + 8 = 48\n- 9: 40 + 0 = 40\n\nSo, in the tens place, digit 4 appears 50 times, and digit 8 appears 48 times. So, the difference here is 50 - 48 = 2 more 4's than 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 48 times. So, 4's are more by 2.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is a bit different because it only changes every 100 pages. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0 (since they're two-digit numbers). From 100-199, it's 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place?\n\n- 0: from 1-99, which is 99 pages, but since we're starting from page 1, which is a one-digit number, but in terms of hundreds digit, it's 0. So, 0 appears 99 times? Wait, no, because page numbers from 1-99 have two digits, but the hundreds digit is 0. So, how many times does 0 appear in the hundreds place? Well, it's from page 1 to page 99, which is 99 pages. So, 0 appears 99 times in the hundreds place.\n\n- 1: from 100-199, which is 100 pages, so 100 times.\n\n- 2: from 200-299, another 100 pages, so 100 times.\n\n- 3: from 300-399, another 100 pages, so 100 times.\n\n- 4: from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nDigits 5-9: from 500 onwards, but since the book only has 488 pages, these digits don't appear in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- 0: 99 times\n- 1: 100 times\n- 2: 100 times\n- 3: 100 times\n- 4: 89 times\n- 5-9: 0 times\n\nWait, but wait, pages 1-99: 99 pages, so 0 appears 99 times in the hundreds place. Pages 100-199: 100 pages, so 1 appears 100 times. Similarly for 200-299 and 300-399. Then 400-488 is 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times.\n\nSo, for the hundreds place:\n\n- Digit 4 appears 89 times.\n- Digit 8: does 8 appear in the hundreds place? No, because the highest hundreds digit is 4 (400-488). So, digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's than 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the differences from each digit place:\n\n- Units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49 \u2192 difference 0\n- Tens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 48 \u2192 difference +2\n- Hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0 \u2192 difference +89\n\nSo, total difference is 0 + 2 + 89 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in units place? Every 10 pages, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once more (484). So total 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, 8 in units place: same calculation, 48 +1 =49.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For 488 pages, the tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times per hundred in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 times each digit. Then, the remaining 88 pages: from 401-488. The tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, digits 0-7 each appear 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times. So, for digit 4 in the tens place: 40 (from the first 400 pages) +10 (from 401-480) =50 times. For digit 8 in the tens place: 40 (from first 400) +8 (from 481-488) =48 times.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- As calculated, 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up the differences:\n\n- Units: 0\n- Tens: +2\n- Hundreds: +89\nTotal difference: 91.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so 89 times. Correct.\n\nAnd 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, which is less than 500. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =97.\n\nDifference: 188 -97 =91.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total complete blocks of 10: 48 (480 pages).\n   - Remaining pages: 8 (481-488).\n   - 4 appears once in the remaining pages (484).\n   - 8 appears once in the remaining pages (488).\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Difference: 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Total complete hundreds: 4 (400 pages).\n   - Remaining pages: 88 (401-488).\n   - Digits 0-7 each appear 10 times in the tens place.\n   - Digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n   - 4 appears 50 times (40 from 400 pages + 10 from 401-480).\n   - 8 appears 48 times (40 from 400 pages + 8 from 481-488).\n   - Difference: 50 - 48 = 2.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 1-99: 0 appears 99 times.\n   - Pages 100-199: 1 appears 100 times.\n   - Pages 200-299: 2 appears 100 times.\n   - Pages 300-399: 3 appears 100 times.\n   - Pages 400-488: 4 appears 89 times.\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Difference: 89 - 0 = 89.\n\nSumming the differences:\n- Units: 0\n- Tens: +2\n- Hundreds: +89\nTotal difference: 0 + 2 + 89 = 91.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 91.  \n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number, depending on how big the page number is. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nLet me start by thinking about how many times the digit 4 appears in each position: units, tens, and hundreds. Similarly, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can compare the total counts.\n\nStarting with the digit 4. \n\nFirst, the units place: In every set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10 and then an extra 8 pages. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times, plus one more time in the 484th page, making it 49 times.\n\nWait, actually, let me correct that. Since 488 is the last page, the units digit cycles every 10 pages. So, from 1 to 480, there are 480 pages, which is 48 sets of 10. Each set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which adds another 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 pages. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many times this happens.\n\nFrom 1-400: There are four sets of 100 pages. In each set, the 40-49 range contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40 times.\n\nThen, from 400-488: The next set would be 440-449, which is 10 pages, but 488 is less than 499, so 440-449 is fully included. So, that's another 10 times. So, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, no, because from 400-488, 440-449 is within that range, so that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's are 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 400-488) = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4, in every set of 10, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\n488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, from 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which is another 8 in the units place. So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 pages. So, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 pages, not 10.\n\nSo, from 1-400: There are four sets of 100 pages. Each set contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n\nFrom 400-488: The 480-489 range would be the next set, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 pages (480-488). So, that's 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's = 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 4's were 188 and 8's were 98, so the difference would be 90. But let me check again.\n\nWait, when calculating the tens place for 8's, from 400-488, the 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, 40 (from 1-400) + 9 = 49. So, total 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, but when I calculated 4's, I had 188. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But let me double-check because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, for the 4's in the tens place: From 1-400, there are four sets of 100, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, from 400-488, the 440-449 range is 10 pages, so that's another 10. So, 40+10=50. So, that's correct.\n\nFor the 8's in the tens place: From 1-400, four sets, each with 10 8's, so 40. From 400-488, 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9. So, 40+9=49. That's correct.\n\nUnits place for both digits: 49 each, so that's correct.\n\nHundreds place: 89 for 4's and 0 for 8's. So, 89 + 50 +49=188 for 4's, and 49+49=98 for 8's.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again.\n\nFrom 400-488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? It's every page from 400 to 488, which is 488-400+1=89 pages. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the hundreds place, there are none because 800 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place, 50 in the tens, 49 in the units, total 188.\n\nFor 8's: 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, total 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can use a formula or another method to cross-verify.\n\nAlternatively, for each digit position, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n- For 4: floor(488/10) = 48, plus if the last digit is >=4, add 1. Since 488 ends with 8, which is >=4, so 48+1=49.\n- For 8: Similarly, floor(488/10)=48, plus if the last digit >=8, add 1. Since 488 ends with 8, so 48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n- For 4: floor(488/100)=4, so 4 full cycles. Each cycle contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, the remaining pages are 488 - 4\u00d7100=88 pages. So, in the tens place, how many 4's? The tens digit cycles every 100, so in the remaining 88 pages (400-488), the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, total 40+10=50.\n- For 8: Similarly, floor(488/100)=4, so 4\u00d710=40. Remaining pages: 488-400=88. In the tens place, 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, total 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n- For 4: floor(488/1000)=0, but since 400-488 is within the book, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages (400-488). So, 89.\n- For 8: Since 800>488, no hundreds place 8's.\n\nSo, adding up:\n- 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188\n- 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - In every block of 10 numbers, '4' appears once in the units place.\n     - Total blocks of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full blocks (480 pages) + 8 extra pages.\n     - '4' appears 48 times in the units place from 1-480.\n     - In 481-488, '4' appears once (at 484).\n     - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - In every block of 100 numbers, '4' appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49).\n     - Total blocks of 100 in 488 pages: 4 full blocks (400 pages) + 88 extra pages.\n     - '4' appears 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 times in the tens place from 1-400.\n     - In 400-488, '4' appears in 440-449, contributing another 10 times.\n     - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - '4' appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n     - Total pages: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n     - Total: 89.\n\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Similar to '4', '8' appears once in every block of 10.\n     - Total blocks: 48 full blocks + 8 extra pages.\n     - '8' appears 48 times from 1-480.\n     - In 481-488, '8' appears once (at 488).\n     - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - In every block of 100, '8' appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89).\n     - Total blocks: 4 full blocks (400 pages) + 88 extra pages.\n     - '8' appears 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 times from 1-400.\n     - In 400-488, '8' appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages.\n     - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - No pages in 1-488 have '8' in the hundreds place.\n     - Total: 0.\n\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8' in the page numbers.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number, depending on how big the page number is. \n\nWait, the book has 488 pages, so the page numbers go from 1 to 488. That means the page numbers can be one-digit (1-9), two-digit (10-99), or three-digit (100-488). So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each of these positions and do the same for the digit 8, then find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 fours. But wait, in the last partial block, which is 481-488, the units digit goes up to 8, so 484 is the last number where the units digit is 4. So, that's one more 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for a block of 10 numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. How many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: The hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're starting from page 1, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, then 1 for 100-199, and so on up to 400-488.\n\nWait, no, actually, the tens place cycles every 100 numbers. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 exactly 10 times. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete hundreds do we have? Well, 488 is in the 400s, so we have four complete hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and then 400-488. Wait, that's actually five hundreds, but the first one is 0-99, which is technically the same as 1-99. Hmm, maybe I should think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to calculate how many times the tens digit is 4. So, in each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times, so each digit appears 10 times in the tens place per hundred. So, from 1-99, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then from 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's five blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each contributes 10 fours, so 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, total tens place 4's are 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each number from 400-488 has a hundreds digit of 4. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, every block of 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48 eights. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which is an 8. So, that's one more, making total units place 8's = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each such block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. How many such blocks are there up to 488?\n\nFrom 1-99: 80-89 is one block, contributing 10 eights.\n\nFrom 100-199: 180-189, another 10.\n\nFrom 200-299: 280-289, another 10.\n\nFrom 300-399: 380-389, another 10.\n\nFrom 400-488: 480-489, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers, right? Because 488 is the last page, so 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers, not 10. So, that block contributes 9 eights.\n\nSo, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one block of 9 (480-488). So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, hundreds place eights are 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, total 4's are 188, total 8's are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, 4's:\n\n- Units: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, plus one more in 484, so 49. That seems right.\n\n- Tens: 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). Each has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That seems correct.\n\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so 89. So, 49+50+89=188. That's correct.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, plus one more in 488, so 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds: 0, since no pages are in 800s. So, total 8's=49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me think again. Wait, when counting the hundreds place for 4's, I included 400-488, which is 89 numbers. But in the tens place for 8's, I included 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place for 4's. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there? The last term is 484, which is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: 8,18,28,...,488. Last term is 488. So, (488-8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place for 4's: Each hundred contributes 10, and there are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, right? So, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place for 8's: Each hundred contributes 10, except the last one, which contributes 9. So, 4 blocks of 10, and one of 9, totaling 49. Correct.\n\nSo, the total 4's are 188, 8's are 98. So, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again: 188-98=90. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in higher places, I might have made a mistake. Let me try a different approach: calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position separately again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write a small table for each position.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal: 49+50+89=188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** Every 10 numbers contribute one '4'. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades and one extra in 484, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens place:** Each hundred contributes 10 '4's in the tens place. There are five such blocks (40-49, 140-149, etc.), totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 contribute 89 '4's in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to '4's, there are 49 '8's.\n   - **Tens place:** Each hundred contributes 10 '8's, except the last block which contributes 9 (480-488), totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No '8's as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI guess the first thing to do is to figure out how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll handle each position for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:** The digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, in every set of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. How many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets and then 8 extra numbers. So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 times, plus one more time in the 481-490 range, but since we only go up to 488, that's actually 48 times plus 1 more (since 484 is within 481-488). Wait, no, actually, 488 is the last page, so the units digit cycles up to 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, which is 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48 times, plus in the last partial cycle (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (484). So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). How many such sets are there? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds and then 88 pages. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (301-488), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? The tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, etc., but wait, 400-488 is within the last partial hundred. Wait, no, 301-488 is actually from 301 to 488, so the tens digit 4 appears in 400-409 and 410-419, but wait, 400-409 is 10 numbers, and 410-419 is another 10, but 488 is beyond 419, so actually, 400-488 includes 400-488, so the tens digit 4 appears in 400-409 (10 times) and 410-419 (another 10 times), but wait, 419 is 419, and 488 is higher, but the tens digit is 4 only up to 419. So, from 400-419, that's 20 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, in the last partial hundred, we have 20 occurrences. Therefore, total tens place 4's are 40 (from the first 300 pages) plus 20, making 60.\n\nWait, hold on, I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me check again. The total number of pages is 488, so the hundreds are 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, for the tens digit 4, each hundred block (like 1-99, 100-199, etc.) has a set where the tens digit is 4. In each of the first four hundreds (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times each (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 400-409 and 410-419, which is 20 numbers, so 20 times. So total tens place 4's are 40 + 20 = 60.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (60) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 60 = 109, plus 89 is 198. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, actually, when calculating the hundreds place, I think I made a mistake. The hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. So, total 4's are units (49) + tens (60) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 60 = 109, plus 89 is 198. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. In the last partial cycle (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit 8 appears in sets like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each such set has 10 numbers. How many full sets are there? 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 full hundreds. Each contributes 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, in the last partial hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times. Therefore, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. From 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, yes, 9 times. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit 8 would be from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's are 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 198, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 198 - 98 = 100.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, when calculating the hundreds place for 4, I had 89 numbers from 400-488, which is correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nFor the tens place, 4's: in each hundred, 10 times, so 4 hundreds give 40, plus in 400-488, we have 400-409 (10) and 410-419 (another 10), so 20. So, 40 + 20 = 60. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place for 4: 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus one more in 484, making 49. Correct.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 48 full cycles, 48, plus one in 488, making 49. Correct.\n\nTens place for 8's: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40, plus in 400-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 8's: 0, correct.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 (units) + 60 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 198.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 198 - 98 = 100.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 100 seems like a big difference. Let me see if I missed anything.\n\nWait, perhaps I overcounted the hundreds place for 4. Let me think: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, 89 times, correct.\n\nTens place for 4: in each hundred, 10 times, so 4 hundreds give 40, plus in 400-488, 400-409 and 410-419, which is 20 more, so 60 total. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 4: 48 full cycles, 48, plus one more in 484, so 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, units and tens seem correct.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 100. So, there are 100 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 198, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 100.\n\n$\\boxed{100}$"
