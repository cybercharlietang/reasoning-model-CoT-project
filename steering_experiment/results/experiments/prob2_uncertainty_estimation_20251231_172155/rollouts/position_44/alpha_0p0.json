Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, let's count how many sets of 10 numbers have 8 in the tens place. Each set is 10 numbers, so 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 489 is beyond 488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, the first four sets have 10 each, and the last set has 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 98.

But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set. - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189:10. - 280-289:10. - 380-389:10. - 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yep, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, let me check that again. Units:49, tens:49, so 49+49=98. That seems right. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me go through the 4's again. Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, how many numbers? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, (484-4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488:89 numbers. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For the 8's: Units place:8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89:10,180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place:0. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. So, 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 488 - 400 +1=89. Correct. And for the tens place in 4's, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. Similarly, for the 8's in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, I think the calculation is accurate.

But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit being 8. Let me count how many full sets there are. Each 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-489 would be the next set, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many eights in the tens place? 4 full sets (80-89, etc.) give 4*10=40, plus the partial set 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total eights in tens place: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488.

Each of these blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10 because 489 is beyond 488). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we stop at 488, it's 480,481,...,488, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks give 4*10=40 eights, and the last block gives 9 eights.

Wait, but 480-488 is part of the tens digit being 8, right? So, let's count each block. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page).

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49 =98. Wait, that seems correct? Let me check again. Units:49, tens:49, so total 98 eights. Wait, but when I counted the tens place, I had 480-488 as 9 numbers, so 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. That's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, 49 in tens place, 49 in units, total 98. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98 =90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many numbers? The formula is (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in units. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 488 -400 +1=89. So, 89 fours. 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. Now for 8's: Units place:8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=49. So, 49. Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.

For the hundreds place, 400-488: 89 numbers, correct. For the tens place in 4's, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. For the tens place in 8's, 480-488 is 9 numbers, which is correct.

Let's see: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights. So, 4*10=40 eights in the tens place.

Then, the next set would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 more eights in the tens place.

For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, when I was counting the tens place for eights, I thought 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's 9 eights. So, in the tens place, it's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 49. That seems right. Units place: 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers.

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last set.

Let's count how many sets of 10 there are. Each block of 100 numbers has a set of 10 where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488).

That's correct. And hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. That's 49 terms, as calculated earlier. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets contributes 10, and the last set contributes 9, totaling 49. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems a large difference. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct. For eights, hundreds place is zero. So, yes, 188 fours vs 98 eights, difference is 90.

Wait, 480-489 would be the next set, but since the book ends at 488, we only go up to 488.

Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. Wait, that can't be right because 188-98 is 90. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through the fours again. Units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I thought the answer was 90, but I'm a bit unsure. Let me check another way. Maybe I can count the number of times each digit appears in each position again. Units place for 4: from 4,14,...,484. That's (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place for 4: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Correct. Hundreds place for 4: 400-488:89 numbers. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: Units:8,18,...,488. That's (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, 49+49=98 eights. Therefore, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when counting digits, especially in the hundreds place, I might have missed something. Let me think again about the hundreds place for 4. From 400 to 488, inclusive. 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct. So, yes, 188 fours and 98 eights, so 90 more fours. I think that's right.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The last block contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No occurrence since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count each block. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10 +10+10+10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me check my calculations again to be sure. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit '4' appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit '4' appears in numbers 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** The digit '8' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit '8' appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. The last block is 480-488, contributing 9. Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** Subtract the total '8's from '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me calculate how many numbers that is. Each full hundred (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.

So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = \\frac{480}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n   \n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).  \n     \\[\n     5 \\times 10 = 50\n     \\]\n   \n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n     \\]\n   \n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 50 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 89 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = \\frac{480}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n   \n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     Each block contributes 10 numbers, except the last block (480-488) which contributes 9 numbers.  \n     \\[\n     4 \\times 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49\n     \\]\n   \n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book only has 488 pages.  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     0\n     \\]\n   \n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 49 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 0 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 98\n\\]\n\n**Difference between the number of 4's and 8's:**  \n\\[\n188 \\, (\\text{number of 4's}) - 98 \\, (\\text{number of 8's}) = 90\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"
