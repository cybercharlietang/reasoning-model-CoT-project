Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. Let's count how many numbers have 8 in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, is that right? 480 is the first, then 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers. So, total eights in the tens place: 10 +10+10+10+9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188 -98=90. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me recount the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488 inclusive. 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. Correct. For eights in the tens place, I had 480-488 as 9 numbers. But wait, 480 is included, right? So from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Units place for eights: 488 is included, so 49 numbers. Correct. So, 188 fours and 98 eights, difference is 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Wait, 480-488 is part of the tens digit being 8, but since 488 is the last page, that's correct. Let's count how many numbers: Each set of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, right? Wait, 480, 481,...,488: that's 9 numbers because 488 -480 +1=9. So, the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, etc.) each have 10 eights, and the last set (480-488) has 9.

Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 380-389 is included, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so only up to 488. So, how many sets of 10 in the tens place? Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights. So, 4*10=40 eights in the tens place. But wait, 480-488 is part of the book, so does that count as a set? Let me think. The tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, the numbers 480-488 have 8 in the tens place. That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place for the 400s. So, total tens place eights would be 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 from 480-488. Wait, no, actually, 480-488 is part of the 400s, so maybe I should consider it as a separate case. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the tens digit as 8 in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place.

Units:49, tens:49, so total eights are 98. Now, the number of fours was 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.

For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

    "text": " So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many numbers have 8 in the tens place. Each full block (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Then, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, so 49. Wait, no, let me think again. Wait, 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, that's 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours -98 eights = 90. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake. Wait, when I calculated the tens place for fours, I thought it was 50, but let me double-check. For fours in the tens place, it's 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, which is 50 fours. That seems correct. For eights in the tens place, I have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So that's 4 full sets (each 10 numbers) and one partial set from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That seems correct. For units place, both fours and eights have 49 each, right? Because 488 is included for both. Wait, but for fours, in the units place, the last number is 484, which is 484. So, 484 is the 49th occurrence. Similarly, for eights, the last occurrence in units place is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, that's correct. So, fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188. Eights:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98. So, 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. That seems correct. So, yes, the difference is 90.

For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's the answer. But let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me recount the hundreds place for fours: from 400-488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Yep. For the tens place, I had 5 sets of 10 for fours, which is 50. Units place for fours was 49. For eights, units place was 49, tens place was 49, so 98 total. So, 188-98=90.

But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there?

So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed. Hmm, but let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly for fours? The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. That's correct. For eights in the tens place, I had 4 blocks of 10 (from 1-400) and then 9 more in 480-488, totaling 49.

Well, the book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks we have. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199:180-189 (10). From 200-299:280-289 (10). From 300-399:380-389 (10). From 400-488:480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10, because 488 is the last page.

Tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   Number of 4's:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.  \n   Each block of 100 contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks within 488 pages.  \n   Number of 4's:  \n   \\[\n   5 \\times 10 = 50\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.  \n   Number of 4's:  \n   \\[\n   488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n   \\]\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 50 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 89 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   Number of 8's:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.  \n   Each block of 100 contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block which contributes 9.  \n   Number of 8's:  \n   \\[\n   4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.  \n   Number of 8's:  \n   \\[\n   0\n   \\]\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 49 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 0 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 98\n\\]\n\n**Difference between the number of 4's and 8's:**  \n\\[\n188 - 98 = 90\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last set. So, how many sets do we have? From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, the tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80s, 180s, 280s, 380s) and one set of 9 (480s). So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. Maybe I should check the counts again. For fours in units place: from 4,14,...,484. The formula is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each set is 10, and there are 5 sets, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets is 10, last set is 9. So, 4*10=40, 40+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, since 800+ is beyond 488. So, 98 eights. So, 188-98=90.

But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that range. So, each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks we have. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480, 481, ..., 488 is 9 numbers? Wait, no: 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers? Let me check: 488 - 480 = 8, so 8 +1 =9. So, the last block has 9 numbers instead of 10. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks with 10 each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one block with 9 (480-488).

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me double-check that. Units:49, tens:49, so 49+49=98. Yep, that's correct. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each full hundred (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Then, from 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488).

So, 484 is the last one. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488:488-400+1=89. Correct.\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nNow, eights:\n\n- Units place:8,18,...,488. The last term is 488. The number of terms is (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: none, since 800>488. So, 0.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many eights in the tens place. Each full block (like 80-89) has 10 eights in the tens place.

So 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, so the difference is 90. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place. For the tens place in fours, I have 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Units place: 49. So, 188 seems correct.
