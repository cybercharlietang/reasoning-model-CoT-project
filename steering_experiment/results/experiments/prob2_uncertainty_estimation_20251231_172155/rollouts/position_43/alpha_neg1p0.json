    "text": " The number of terms can be calculated by (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 also count? But the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me see. Each set of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, right? Wait, no, from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488). Wait, but 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, but 480 is included, so actually, it's 9 numbers. Wait, but 480 is the first, then 481 up to 488, which is 9 numbers in total. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place for the 480-488 range. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. So, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place (Ones Place):** The digit '4' appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). The count is calculated as:\n     - First occurrence: 4\n     - Last occurrence: 484\n     - Number of terms: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '4' appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each hundred has 10 such numbers, and there are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). However, the last range (400-488) only goes up to 488, but since we're considering the tens place, it's still 10 numbers (440-449). Thus:\n     - Number of terms: 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '8' appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). The count is:\n     - First occurrence: 8\n     - Last occurrence: 488\n     - Number of terms: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '8' appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each hundred has 10 such numbers, and there are 5 hundreds. However, the last range (480-488) only includes 9 numbers (480-488). Thus:\n     - Number of terms: 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 49\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers with '8' in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.  \nThe final answer is \\boxed{90}."

Wait, but 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Let's calculate how many sets of 100 we have where the tens digit is 8. From 0-99: 80-89:10 numbers. 100-199:180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488: let's see, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, how many 8's in the tens place? For each complete hundred, it's 10. There are four complete hundreds (0-399), so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (400-488), we have 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So total eights in tens place: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's it.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each full hundred (like 1-100) has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place.

So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but since the book ends at 488, we have 480-488. So, let's count how many sets of 100 have 10 eights in the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Now, the 480-488 range: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so the tens digit is 8 for all of these. So, that's an additional 9 eights. So total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that can't be right because 49+49 is 98, but let me check again. Units: 49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. So total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, fours:\n\n- Units: 4,14,...,484. So, from 4 to 484, step 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n- Tens: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Correct.\n- Hundreds: 400-488: 488-400+1=89. Correct.\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nEights:\n\n- Units:8,18,...,488. ((488-8)/10)+1=(480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n- Tens: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. So 4 sets, 40. Then 480-488: 9 numbers, so 9 eights in tens place. Total tens eights:40+9=49. Correct.\n- Hundreds: none, so 0.\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm thinking, does the page number 488 have an 8 in the tens place? Yes, 488 is in the 480-489 range, so the tens digit is 8, and it's counted in the tens place count. So, that's correct.\n\nAnother check: let's see, from 1-100, how many 4's and 8's.\n\n4's: 4,14,24,34,44: that's 5 in units, and 40-49:10 in tens, and 0 in hundreds. So 5+10=15 fours. Wait, but in 1-100, hundreds digit is 0, so no fours there. So 15 fours in 1-100.\n\nSimilarly, 8's: 8,18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98: 10 in units, and 80-89:10 in tens, so 20 eights in 1-100.\n\nBut according to my earlier count, in 1-100, units eights are 10 (8,18,...,98) and tens eights are 10 (80-89), so total 20. But in my overall count, for the entire book, I had 49 units eights and 49 tens eights, totaling 98. Wait, but 49 units eights would be up to 488, which is correct because 488 is the last page.\n\nWait, but in 1-100, units eights are 10, so in 1-400, units eights would be 40, and from 401-488, units eights would be 8 (481,491,...,488? Wait, 481 is 481, but 491 is beyond 488, so actually, from 401-488, the units eights would be 481, 491 is beyond, so only 481 and 491 is beyond. Wait, no, 481 is 481, 491 is 491, but 491 is beyond 488, so only 481, 491 is beyond, so only 481. Wait, but that's not right because 481 is 481, but 488 is the last page. So, from 401-488, the units eights would be 481, 491 is beyond. So only one more unit eight. So total units eights would be 40 (from 1-400) plus 1 (481), totaling 41. But earlier, I thought it was 49. Hmm, that suggests a mistake in my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the units eights. Let me recalculate.\n\nThe units eights occur every 10 numbers. So, starting at 8, then 18, 28, ..., up to 488.\n\nHow many terms are there? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1.\n\nSo, last term is 488, first is 8, step is 10.\n\nSo, ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So that's correct. So, 49 units eights.\n\nWait, but when I think about 1-400, that's 40 terms (8,18,...,398), which is 40 eights. Then from 401-488, the next eights would be 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 8 more, making it 40+8=48. Wait, but 488 is included, so that's 8 terms. So, total units eights would be 40+8=48, plus the initial 40? Wait, no, because from 1-400, it's 40 eights, and from 401-488, it's 8 more, so total 48. But according to the formula, it's 49. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Let me check: 8,18,...,488.\n\nLet me list them:\n\n8,18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98,108,118,...,398,408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488.\n\nWait, so from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. How many terms?\n\nFrom 8 to 488, inclusive, step 10.\n\nNumber of terms = ((488 -8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 terms. So, the count is correct. So, perhaps when I was thinking about 401-488, I missed that 408 is within 401-488, right? 408 is 408, which is within 401-488. So, from 401-488, the units eights are 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 terms, not 8. So, 408 is the first one after 400, then 418, 428,...,488. That's 9 terms. So, from 1-400:40 eights, and from 401-488:9 eights, total 49. So, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for tens eights:\n\nFrom 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total tens eights:49.\n\nSo, total eights:49+49=98.\n\nSimilarly, for fours, the counts seem correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 fours -98 eights=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I initially thought 4's would be more than 8's, but 90 seems like a lot. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 188 fours and 98 eights. So, 188-98=90. That's correct. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 fours, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - First four blocks contribute 10 eights each, totaling 40.\n   - The range 480-488 contributes 9 eights.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 fours - 98 eights = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Let me count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, except the last one which might be shorter. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So that's 4 full sets of 10 and one set of 9. So total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. Wait, but let me make sure. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9.

For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Wait, 480-488 is part of the tens digit being 8, but only up to 488. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with tens digit 8, except possibly the last block if it doesn't go up to 490. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 = 8, so 8+1=9). So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 40+9=49.

Wait, but in the tens place, when I considered 480-488, that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, etc.) is 40, plus 9, totaling 49 in the tens place. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the number of fours is 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

Let's count how many sets there are. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, because 488 is the last page). Wait, is that right? From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488). So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, the tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place.

So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is within range, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so we only go up to 480-488. Wait, does 480-488 count? Let me think. The tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except maybe the last block. Let's see: From 1-100: 80-89:10 eights. 101-200:180-189:10. 201-300:280-289:10. 301-400:380-389:10. Now, 401-488: The tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total eights in tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, actually, 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, so let's see: From 400-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? It's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in each hundred block before 400, we have 10 eights in the tens place. So, 1-300: 3 sets of 10, so 30. Then 400-488: 9. So, total eights in tens place: 30 +9=39? Wait, that conflicts with my earlier thought. Let me clarify: The hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488, so the tens digit in 400-488 is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, prior to that, from 1-399, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? It's 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 4 sets, which is 40 eights. Then, in 400-488, it's 9 more eights in the tens place. So, total eights in tens place: 40 +9=49. Wait, that seems correct. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, but earlier I thought in the tens place, from 1-399, it's 40 eights, and then 9 more in 400-488, totaling 49. That seems correct. So, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.

Let me see: 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 49 numbers. That seems right. For eights, units place: 8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, plus 1 is 49. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10, the last set has 9, so 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, total 98 eights. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488 only 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, so 4*10=40 +9=49.

So, 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Units place: starting at 4, every 10, up to 484. So, 484 is the 49th number because (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in units. Similarly, for eights, units place: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, which is 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: how many? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens place in the hundreds block 400-499 would be 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 40, plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, 49 + 49 is 98? Wait, 49 + 49 is actually 98, but let me check again. Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Let me recount the fours. Units place: from 4,14,...484. 484 is the 49th term because (484-4)/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each 10 numbers, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place:8,18,...488. (488-8)/10 +1=49. Tens place:80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

Wait, but let me think again. From 80-89: 10 eights. Similarly, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.

From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, the tens digit is 8 in 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9).

Let's calculate how many numbers have 8 in the tens place. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, because 488 -480 +1=9). Wait, is that right? 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, that's 9 numbers. So, the tens place has 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me check that again. Units place:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. That seems correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's.

So, 49 in the tens place. Units place is 49, so total eights are 98. For fours, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 188. So, 188-98=90. I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I should recount the fours in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems right. And the tens place for fours: 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. Units place: every 10 numbers, starting at 4, so 4,14,24,...,484. Let's see how many that is. The formula is ((484 - 4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in the units place. So, 49+50+89=188. That's correct. So, the difference is 90.

The number of such occurrences is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = \\frac{480}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '4' appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), totaling:\n     \\[\n     5 \\times 10 = 50\n     \\]\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit '4' appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is:\n     \\[\n     488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n     \\]\n   - **Total '4's:** Summing up all occurrences:\n     \\[\n     49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n     \\]\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '8' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). The count is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = \\frac{480}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '8' appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each range contributes 10 numbers, except the last range (480-488), which contributes 9 numbers. Thus:\n     \\[\n     4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49\n     \\]\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers with '8' in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** Summing up all occurrences:\n     \\[\n     49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of '4's} - \\text{Number of '8's} = 188 - 98 = 90\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many sets there are. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), right? Because 488 is the last page. So, for the tens place, we have four full sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 eights, and the last set 480-488 contributing 9 eights.

Tens place for fours: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, and there are 5 blocks, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place:400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct. So, 188 fours. For eights, units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 98 eights. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, I thought maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, right? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in hundreds place. So, yes, 188 fours. Eights:98. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let me check the units place for fours again. From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. For eights in units place, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place for fours: each hundred block has 10 numbers with 4 in tens place, and there are 5 blocks (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449). 5*10=50. Correct. Tens place for eights: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98.

    "text": " The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets are there? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, which is 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets there are. Each hundred has one set of 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, not 10). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) -98 (eights)=90.

Let me calculate how many numbers have 8 in the tens place. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: let's see, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9.

The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That's correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for eights. Let me recount the tens place eights.

That's five sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49. That also seems correct. So, the difference is indeed 90.
