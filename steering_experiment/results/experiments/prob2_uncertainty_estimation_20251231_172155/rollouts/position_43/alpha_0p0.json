    "text": " The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's count each block: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10*4=40 plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through the counts again. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

Let's count each block. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 +9 =49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10, except the last which contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No numbers in the range have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- More 4's than 8's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Each of these sets contributes 10 eights, except the last one, which is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights here. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. Wait, that seems a bit low. Let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. So, total eights are 98. Hmm, but wait, in the tens place, I had 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, 49 in tens place. Units place: same as fours, 49. So, total eights:49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) -98 (eights)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each step again. For fours: units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total:49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total:98. So, 188-98=90.

Wait, 80-89:10, each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 10 each, so that's 4*10=40.

So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That's correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for fours and eights. For fours in the tens place, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. That's correct. For eights in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49. That seems correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a large number. Let me try another approach. Maybe I can count the number of times each digit appears in each position and see if that matches. Alternatively, I can think about how many numbers have 4 in each digit and how many have 8.

Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

Now, 480-489 would be another set, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Each full set (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Let's count how many full sets we have: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Now, check if there's an incomplete set at the end. 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, in the tens place, 480-488 has 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many numbers that is. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except maybe the last one. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.

So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For the units place of fours: from 4 to 484, that's 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each is 10 numbers, and there are 5 such sets (40-49 is the first set, then each hundred block). So, 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers. Correct. For eights: units place, 8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.

That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50 fours. Units place for fours: every 10 numbers, starting at 4, so 4,14,...,484. 484 is the 49th term because 484/10=48.4, but since we include both ends, it's 49 numbers. So, 49 fours. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. For eights, units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is the 49th term because (488-8)/10=48, plus 1 is 49. Tens place: 80-89,180-189, etc., up to 480-488. Each of the first four sets is 10, and the last is 9, so 4*10 +9=49. So, eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, I think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   Number of 4's = ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 fours in the tens place.  \n   Number of 4's = 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488.  \n   Number of 4's = 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   Number of 8's = ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last block which has 9.  \n   Number of 8's = 4 sets \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   Number of 8's = 0.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

Wait, but let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so yes, that's correct. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many sets there are. Each hundred has one set of 10, except maybe the last one.

Since 484 is the last one, which is 484 = 4 + 10*(48). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n- Tens place: 5 sets (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449). Each set has 10, so 5*10=50.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49 (8,18,...,488). 488 is the last one, so 488 = 8 + 10*48, so 48 +1=49.\n- Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9.

Wait, but let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly for 4's. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nAnd for the tens place of 4's, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine.\n\nFor the 8's, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, which is correct because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers (since 488-480=8, so 8+1=9).\n\nSo, yes, 98 eights in total.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, 4 full sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) and one set of 9, making 49 in the tens place. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Now, the problem is to find how many more 4's than 8's there are. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This sequence has 49 numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The last block contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's as the book ends at 488.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last set. Let's count how many sets there are. Each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 40 + 9 = 49.

Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.

Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is okay, and 480-489 would be next, but 488 is the last page. So, let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. But wait, does 480-488 also have 8 in the tens place? Let me check: 480-488 is part of the hundreds place being 4, and the tens digit is 8. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, 480-488 contributes 9 eights. So, total tens place eights would be 4*10 +9=49. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.

So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, does 488 count? Yes, because the tens digit is 8. So, the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, etc.) each contribute 10, and the last set contributes 9. So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, let me check again. Units:49, tens:49, so total is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 also count? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. So, how many sets are there? Let's see: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 40+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but wait, let me check. 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.
