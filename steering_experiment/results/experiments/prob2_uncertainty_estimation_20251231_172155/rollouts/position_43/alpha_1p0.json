    "text": " Let me calculate how many numbers that is. The formula is ((last - first)/step) + 1. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except the last block, which only goes up to 488. So, let's break it down: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so 49+49=98. Hmm, but wait, in the tens place, from 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, that's 4*10 +9=49. So, units:49, tens:49, total 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit place again for both 4's and 8's. For 4's: Units: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, step 10. So, (484-4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds:400-488:89 numbers, each has a 4 in hundreds place. Correct. Total fours:49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units:8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds: none. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, total in tens place is 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, making 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

So, each full hundred has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. How many full hundreds are there? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, that's 9 more eights in the tens place.

Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place, I had 4 full hundreds (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 480-488, which is 9, so 49.

Yes, because 389 is less than 488. Let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10.

So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me make sure. Units:49, tens:49, so 49+49=98. Yep. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me just double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. Correct. So, 188-98=90. Yep, that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10th number, resulting in 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.

This results in 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49. Wait, but 80-89 is within the first 100 pages, right? So, 4 sets of 10, each in 100s: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and then 480-488. So, that's 5 sets, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so 49+49=98. Hmm, that seems correct. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, so 98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I feel like maybe I made a mistake in the tens place for fours. Let me check that again. For fours in the tens place, it's 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each of 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct. For eights in the tens place, it's 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, that's correct.

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Wait, but 480-489 would be another set, but since the book ends at 488, we only go up to 488. Let me count how many sets there are. Each full set (like 80-89) has 10 numbers, so that's 10 eights in the tens place per set. Let's see how many full sets there are. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: how many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place, we have 4 full sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 10 each, so 4*10=40. Then, the last partial set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me make sure. Each full set from 80-89, etc., contributes 10, and the last set contributes 9, so 4*10 +9=49. Correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89, total=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0, total=98. 188-98=90. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place for fours again. When counting units place fours, I went up to 484, which is 484. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms is that? The formula is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nFor tens place fours: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. Correct.\n\nHundreds place fours: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nEights:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10. Number of terms: ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place eights: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last set, 480-488, is 9 numbers. So, total 40+9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place eights: none, since the book ends at 488.

    "text": " Let me calculate how many numbers that is. The formula is ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Each of these blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except maybe the last one. Let's see: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. So that's 40. Then, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 eights in the tens place. So total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that's a lot. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems right because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89 fours in hundreds place. For the tens place in fours, I had 50. Let me see: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct. Units place: 49. So, that's correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49. Let me check the tens place again. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Correct. So, yes, 98 eights. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again. When counting the units place for fours, I considered up to 484, which is 484. So, 4,14,...,484. How many terms is that? The formula is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Similarly, for eights in units place, up to 488, so 8,18,...,488. ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. So, yes, the counts are accurate. Therefore, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of 4's: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Number of 4's: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - Number of 4's: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of 8's: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block (480-488) which has 9.\n   - Number of 8's: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Number of 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let's calculate how many numbers that is. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. Wait, 8,18,...,488. Let's see: 8 is the 1st, 18 is 2nd, ..., 488 is the 49th. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many numbers have 8 in the tens place. Each full block of 100 (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.) contributes 10 eights. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, so 40 eights. Now, the last set is 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, inclusive, that's 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, in the tens place, we have 40 +9=49 eights. Wait, no, that's not right. Because in the tens place, each full block is 10 numbers, but in 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers. So, the tens place has 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, etc.) plus 9 from 480-488. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Wait, that's only 98 eights? Let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so total eights are 98. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place, I thought 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 4 sets of 10 (each contributing 10 eights) plus 9, so 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Now, the number of fours was 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check my calculations again, maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me recount the fours. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many numbers? The formula is (last - first)/step +1. So, (484 -4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: from 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, and how many blocks? From 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: from 400-488. How many numbers? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours. Total fours:49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, eights: Units place: from 8,18,...,488. So, (488 -8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: from 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, so 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, total tens place eights:40+9=49. Correct. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but I feel like that might be correct, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I miscounted somewhere. Let me think about the hundreds place for fours: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. That seems right. For eights, hundreds place: none, since the book only goes up to 488, so no 800s. So, no eights there. So, 188 fours and 98 eights. Difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 occurrences, and the last block contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). Let me count how many sets of 10 there are. Each hundred block (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except possibly the last block. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9.

Let me recount the fours and eights to check for errors.\n\nFor fours:\n- Units: 49 (from 4,14,...,484)\n- Tens: 50 (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449)\n- Hundreds:89 (400-488)\nTotal:49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nFor eights:\n- Units:49 (8,18,...,488)\n- Tens:49 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488)\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but when I was counting the tens place for fours, I included 440-449, which is correct because 449 is less than 488. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Similarly, for eights, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49. So, the counts seem correct. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.

So, each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, and the last set (480-488) has 9 numbers. So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.

So, how many numbers in each set? Each block from 80-89 has 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me make sure. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.

For 4's: units place: 4,14,...,484. That's from 4 to 484, step 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.

For 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488. That's ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers except maybe the last one.

Hmm, but let me check the tens place again. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4*10=40 and 9, totaling 49. So yes, 49 in tens place. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. Wait, but earlier I thought units had 49 and tens had 49, so total 98. But wait, when I counted fours, I had 188. So, the difference would be 188 -98=90. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through the eights again. Units place: 8,18,...,488. That's every 10 numbers starting at 8. The last one is 488, which is 488=8 + (n-1)*10. So, 488-8=480, 480/10=48, so n=49. So units:49. Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So that's 4*10=40 +9=49. So, tens:49. Hundreds:0. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, fours:188, eights:98. Difference:188-98=90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the hundreds place for fours was 89, but for eights, it's zero. Let me confirm the hundreds place for fours: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. So, total fours:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. That seems correct. Eights:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me check the tens place for fours again. From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. Yes, that's correct.

Let me see: For the tens place, each block is 100 numbers, so 80-89 is in 1-100, 180-189 in 101-200, etc. So, 480-489 would be in 401-500, but our book ends at 488.

So, 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, in the tens place, it's 10 each for 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 9 for 480-488. So, 4*10 +9=49.

So, total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, let me check: units is 49, tens is 49, so 49+49=98. That seems correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit place again for both 4's and 8's.\n\nFor fours:\n- Units: 49 (from 4,14,...,484)\n- Tens: 50 (each hundred block has 10, and there are 5 blocks: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449)\n- Hundreds: 89 (400-488)\nTotal fours: 49+50+89=188. That seems right.\n\nFor eights:\n- Units: 49 (8,18,...,488)\n- Tens: 49 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488)\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal eights: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four blocks: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Last block (480-488): 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Let me count how many sets: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

So, how many numbers in each set: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them. So, the first four sets (80-89, etc.) each have 10 eights in the tens place, and the last set (480-488) has 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Yep, that adds up to 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

Let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct?

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last set. Let's count each block. Each block from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: each has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. That's 4 sets, so 4*10=40. Then, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) -98 (eights)=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait a second, when I counted the units place for fours, I thought it was 49, but let me check that again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first is 4, then every 10 numbers: 14,24,...,484. So, how many numbers is that? The sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So that's correct. Similarly, for the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50. And hundreds place is 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10=40 plus 9=49. So, units and tens each have 49 eights, totaling 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again: when I counted the hundreds place for fours, I included 400-488, which is 89 numbers. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 400-488 is indeed 89 numbers. So, that's correct. Similarly, for the tens place in fours, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct.

    "text": " Let's see: 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms are there? The formula is ((last - first)/step) + 1. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of this. So, how many sets of 100 do we have? Let's see: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Wait, no, because 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 480-488: 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488-480=8, so 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10=40 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my counts again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through the fours again: units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer would be 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 8's. Let me check that again. For tens place eights: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, 49 eights in tens place. Units place: from 8 to 488, every 10 numbers, so 49. So, total eights:98. Fours:188. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, I think that's correct.

So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Let's count how many sets of 100 have the tens digit as 8. Each 100 numbers (e.g., 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights, and the last set (480-488) contributes 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total.
