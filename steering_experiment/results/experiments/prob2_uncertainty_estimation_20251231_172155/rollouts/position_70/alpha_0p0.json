Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks:\n     - Total = 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit from the right):** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.

The count is:\n     - (488 // 10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 8 appears in blocks of 100 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The counts are:\n     - 80-89: 10\n     - 180-189: 10\n     - 280-289: 10\n     - 380-389: 10\n     - 480-488: 9 (since 488 is the last page)\n     - Total = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n   **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of 4's = 188\n   - Number of 8's = 98\n   - Difference = 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

The sequence is 4 +10*(n-1)=484. So, 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, n=49. Yes, correct. Similarly, for 8's, units place: 8,18,...,488. 8 +10*(n-1)=488. 10*(n-1)=480, n-1=48, n=49. Correct. Tens place for 8's: 80-89 is 10 numbers, same for each hundred. But in the last set, 480-488, that's 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 5 sets: 4 sets of 10, and 1 set of 9, total 49.

Total 4's:2. 8's:8,18 (units), 80-89 not applicable. So, units:2, tens:0, hundreds:0. Total 8's:2. So, difference is 0. Let me apply my method: For 4's: units: floor(20/10)=2, tens: floor(20/100)*10 + if 20 >=40? No, so 0. Hundreds: if 20 >=400? No, so 0. Total 4's:2. For 8's: units: floor(20/10)=2, tens: floor(20/100)*10 + if 20 >=80? No, so 0. Hundreds:0. Total 8's:2. Difference:0. Correct. So, my method works here. Another test: up to 50. 4's: units:5 (4,14,24,34,44), tens:5 (40-49), hundreds:0. Total 4's:10. 8's: units:5 (8,18,28,38,48), tens:5 (80-89 but up to 50, so only 80-89 not applicable, so 0. Wait, up to 50, so tens place: only 80-89 which is beyond 50, so tens place 0. So, 8's: units:5, tens:0, hundreds:0. Total 8's:5. Difference:10-5=5. Let me count manually: 4's:4,14,24,34,44 (units:5), and 40-49 (tens:10 numbers, so 10 4's in tens place). So total 15? Wait, no, wait. Wait, in the tens place, 40-49 is 10 numbers, each with a 4 in tens, so that's 10 4's. In units, 4,14,24,34,44: that's 5. So total 15 4's. 8's: units:8,18,28,38,48:5. Tens: none, since 80-89 is beyond 50. So, 5 8's. Difference:15-5=10. Wait, but according to my earlier method, I thought it was 10 4's. Wait, no, in the method, units:5, tens:5 (wait, no, in the method earlier, for 50, units:5, tens:5 (40-49 is 10 numbers, so tens place 10 4's, but in the method above, I think I might have misapplied it. Wait, let me re-examine. When I did the problem earlier, for the tens place, I considered each hundred block. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (40-49). So, in 1-50, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Only 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 4's in tens place, and 5 in units. So total 15 4's. Similarly, 8's: units:5, tens:0, so 5. So, difference 10. So, my initial method might have a mistake. Wait, in the initial problem, when I did the 488-page book, I considered units, tens, hundreds. But in the test case of 50, using the same method, units:5, tens:5 (but actually it's 10). Wait, no, in the initial problem, for the tens place, I considered each hundred block. So, for 1-100, tens digit 4 occurs 10 times. So, for 1-50, it's only 10 times? No, because 40-49 is within 50, so 10 times. So, in the 50-page example, units:5, tens:10, hundreds:0. Total 15 4's. 8's: units:5, tens:0, hundreds:0. So, 5. So, difference 10. But according to my initial method, when I did the 488-page book, I considered for the tens place, 5 sets of 10, which was correct because 488 is in the 400-488 range, so 440-449 is the last set, which is 10 numbers. So, that was correct. So, going back, in the 50-page example, using the same method, units:5, tens:10, hundreds:0. So, 15 4's. 8's:5. So, difference 10. So, my initial method works. So, returning to the original problem, 188 fours and 98 eights, so 90 more fours. Therefore, the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This totals 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as there are no pages 800-899.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
