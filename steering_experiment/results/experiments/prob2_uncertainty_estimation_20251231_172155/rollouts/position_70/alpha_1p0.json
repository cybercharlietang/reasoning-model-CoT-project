    "text": " Wait, 488 is included. So, 488 is the last page. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. How many terms? Let's calculate: (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. - Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. - Hundreds place: none. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. Correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should check another approach. For example, in each position, how many times does each digit appear. For a three-digit number, each digit from 0-9 appears equally in each position, except perhaps for the last few numbers. Let me see. For numbers 1-99, the number of times each digit appears in units and tens places can be calculated. But since the book goes up to 488, maybe it's better to think in terms of three-digit numbers. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a formula. The number of times a digit d appears from 1 to n can be calculated using a method where we look at each digit position separately and compute how many times d appears there. Let me try that for 4's and 8's.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of 4's:\n\nWe'll go through each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) and count the number of 4's.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - For every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - From 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing 1 four, so 48 fours.\n   - Now, check the remaining 8 numbers (481-488). The units digit here goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484).\n   - So, total units fours: 48 +1=49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - For every 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 ten times. So, for each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n   - From 1-400, there are 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n   - Now, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0-8 in the hundreds place. Wait, no. Let me think differently. The tens digit cycles every 100. So, from 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 in the tens place, but we're only up to 488. Let me calculate how many full tens cycles are there beyond 400.\n   - From 400-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8 (since 488 is the last number). So, how many complete tens blocks are there? Each block is 10 numbers, so 488 -400 +1=89 numbers, which is 8 full tens blocks (80 numbers) and 9 extra numbers (481-488). Wait, no, that's not the right way. Let me think again. The tens digit in 400-488 can be 0 (400-409), 1 (410-419), ..., up to 8 (480-488). So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears, but the last one (8) only goes up to 488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, for the tens digit:\n   - For tens digits 0-7: each appears 10 times (e.g., 400-409, 410-419, etc.).\n   - For tens digit 8: appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - So, the number of 4's in the tens place from 400-488 is: does the tens digit ever equal 4? Yes, when the tens digit is 4, which would be 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 fours.\n   - So, adding to the previous 40 fours from 1-400, we get 40 +10=50 fours in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 -400 +1=89 numbers.\n   - So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - For every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - From 1-488, there are 48 complete groups of 10 (480 numbers), contributing 48 eights.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits from 1-8, so 8 appears once (488).\n   - So, total units eights:48 +1=49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - For every 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times. So, for each hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n   - From 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n   - From 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0-8. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place here?\n   - The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n   - So, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n   - So, total tens eights:40 (from 1-400) +9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so no eights in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal eights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 fours -98 eights=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449, totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in any page number up to 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

For example, in the hundreds place for 4's, does 488 count as having a 4 in the hundreds place? Yes, because 488 is 4 8 8, so the hundreds digit is 4, so it's included in the 400-488 count, which is 89 numbers. Similarly, in the tens place for 8's, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, yes, 9 eights in the tens place there. So, I think my counts are correct.

This forms an arithmetic sequence where the first term is 4 and the last term is 484. The number of terms is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = \\frac{480}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n     So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place.\n   \n   - **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, so:\n     \\[\n     5 \\times 10 = 50\n     \\]\n     So, there are 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n   \n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. The number of terms here is:\n     \\[\n     488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n     \\]\n     So, there are 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\n   **Total number of 4's:**\n   \\[\n   49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 50 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 89 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 188\n   \\]\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Using the same arithmetic sequence approach:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = \\frac{480}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n     So, there are 49 occurrences of 8 in the units place.\n   \n   - **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges each contribute 10 numbers, and the last range contributes 9 numbers (since the book ends at 488):\n     \\[\n     4 \\times 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49\n     \\]\n     So, there are 49 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n   \n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book only goes up to 488.\n\n   **Total number of 8's:**\n   \\[\n   49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 49 \\, (\\text{tens}) = 98\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of 4's} - \\text{Number of 8's} = 188 - 98 = 90\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let's see, 488 is included. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we include 8, it's 49. Correct. - Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. - Hundreds place: 0. So, total 8's:49+49=98. Correct. So, 188 -98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. Wait, in the hundreds place for 4's, I counted 89, which is correct because 400 to 488 is 89 numbers. But for 8's, in the hundreds place, it's 0, correct. So, yes, 188 -98=90. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, let me check if I didn't overcount somewhere. Let me take a smaller example to test my method. Suppose the book has 20 pages. How many 4's and 8's? Page numbers 1-20. Let's count 4's: 4,14: units place, that's 2. Tens place: 40-49, but we only go up to 20, so 0. Hundreds place: 0. So, total 4's:2. 8's: 8,18: units place, 2. Tens place:80-89, which is beyond 20, so 0. So, total 8's:2. So, 2-2=0. Now, using my method: Units place for 4's: (20 -4)/10 +1= (16)/10 +1=1.6+1=2.6, but we take integer part? Wait, no, maybe my formula is wrong. Wait, in the case of 20, the units place 4's are at 4 and 14, which is 2. So, (20//10)*1 + (if 20%10 >=4, then 1 else 0). Wait, maybe a better way is to calculate how many complete decades there are and then see if there's a partial decade. For units place, the number of 4's is floor((n + 10 - 4)/10). So, for n=20, it's floor((20 +6)/10)=floor(26/10)=2, which is correct. Similarly, for 488, it's floor((488 +6)/10)=floor(494/10)=49. Correct. So, my method works. Similarly, for tens place, the number of 4's is the number of times 4 appears in the tens digit. For each hundred, there's a block where the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers. So, for 488, the hundreds are 0-4, so 5 hundreds (0-4). So, 5*10=50. But wait, in the case of 20, the tens digit 4 would be in 40-49, which is beyond 20, so 0. So, my formula for tens place is correct. Similarly, for hundreds place, it's the number of hundreds where the hundreds digit is 4, which is from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. Correct. Similarly, for 8's: units place: floor((488 + 10 -8)/10)=floor(490/10)=49. Tens place: for each hundred, the tens digit 8 occurs once, each time 10 numbers. So, from 80-89, 180-189, etc. For 488, how many hundreds? 0-4, so 5 sets. Each set contributes 10, but the last set (480-488) only has 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, total 49. So, units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 8's:98. So, 188-98=90. So, I think my answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

For 8's, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, which is correct because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers (from 480 to 488 inclusive). So, yes, 9.

So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because in the hundreds place for 4's, 400-488 is 89 numbers, but in the tens place for 8's, 480-488 is 9 numbers. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Alternatively, maybe I should use a formula to count the number of times a digit appears in each position. For a digit d in position p (units, tens, hundreds), the count can be calculated as follows: For each position, the number of times d appears is determined by higher digits and lower digits. But maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, I can think of each digit place separately. Let me try another approach to verify. For units place: 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 /10=48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4, so 48. But wait, in the first group (1-10), 4 appears once (at 4). Similarly, in each subsequent group, it appears once. So, 48 complete groups would give 48 fours, but wait, 488 is the last page, which is 488. So, 488 is the 48th group? Wait, no. Let me see: 1-10: group 1, 11-20: group 2, ..., 481-490: group 49. But our book ends at 488, so group 49 is only up to 488. So, in group 49, the units digit 4 appears at 484. So, in group 49, 484 is the 4th number in the group (since 481,482,483,484). So, does that mean group 49 has one 4 in the units place? Yes, so total units place 4's:49. That's correct. Similarly, for tens place: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). So, from 1-400, how many hundreds? 4 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but 488 is beyond 449, so 440-449 is fully included. Wait, no, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's:40 +10=50. Correct. For hundreds place: 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. Now, for 8's: Units place: same as before, 49. Tens place: Let's see. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). From 1-400, that's 4 sets, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total tens place 8's:40 +9=49. Hundreds place: none, as before. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188 -98=90.
