Did I count correctly in the hundreds place for 4's? 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems right. And for the tens place, 50 fours. Units place 49. So, 188. For 8's, units and tens each have 49, so 98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct. I don't think I made a mistake here.
