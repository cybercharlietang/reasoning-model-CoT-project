    "text": " Let's count how many sets of 100 there are. From 1 to 488, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. In each complete hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). So, for each hundred, that's 10 fours in the tens place. There are 4 complete hundreds, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 fours. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 40-49 in that hundred, but wait, 401-488 is actually 88 numbers. The tens digit is 4 in 40-49, but in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 401-410, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, etc. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. The tens digit is 4 in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. But since the book goes up to 488, the last set is 440-449. So, each set contributes 10 fours in the tens place. There are 5 such sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but earlier I thought there were 4 complete hundreds, but actually, from 1-400, that's four hundreds, but the 440-449 is within the 400-499 range, which is part of the fifth hundred, but since the book only goes up to 488, 440-449 is still within 401-488. So, the total number of fours in the tens place is 5 sets of 10, so 50. Wait, but earlier I thought 4 complete hundreds, but that's not correct because each hundred includes a set where the tens digit is 4. So, 1-100: 40-49 (10 numbers) \u2192 10 fours. 101-200: 140-149 \u2192 10 fours. 201-300: 240-249 \u2192 10 fours. 301-400: 340-349 \u2192 10 fours. 401-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 fours. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, there are 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: 8, 18, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many sets there are. Each set contributes 10 eights in the tens place. From 1-488, the sets are: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so in the tens place, the digit is 8 for all these 9 numbers. So, for the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributes 10 eights, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Then, 480-488 contributes 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. So, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of such numbers: 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4 \u2192 49 numbers.\n   \n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such sets.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 numbers.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188 fours.**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of such numbers: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 49 numbers.\n   \n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four sets contribute 10 each, and 480-488 contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 numbers.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98 eights.**\n\n**Difference:** 188 fours - 98 eights = **90 more fours.**\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me check how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, so for each hundred, there's a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. From 1-99, it's 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199, it's 140-149 (another 10). Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 300-399: 340-349, and 400-488: 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many sets? From 1-99: 1 set, 100-199: 1 set, 200-299: 1 set, 300-399: 1 set, and 400-488: 1 set. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check the last set. 440-449: that's 10 numbers, so yes, 10 fours. So, 5 sets give 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check. Units place: 49 fours. Tens place: 50 fours. Hundreds place: 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, but I feel like that might be too high. Let me recount the units place. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, how many tens are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, which would give 48 fours. But wait, the 48th ten ends at 480, so the next number is 481, and so on up to 488. So, does that mean there's an extra 4 in the units place at 484? Wait, no, 484 is within the 480-489 range, which is the 49th ten. So, actually, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (each contributing a 4) and then an additional 4 at 484. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 fours in the units place. So that part was correct. Tens place: Each hundred has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). 100-199: 140-149 (10). 200-299: 240-249 (10). 300-399: 340-349 (10). 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. That seems correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, which would give 48 eights. But wait, the 48th ten ends at 480, so the next number is 488, which is 8 more than 480. So, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 is included. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, there are 48 full tens, each contributing one 8 in the units place, plus the 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is the 49th number where the units digit is 8. Wait, no. Let me think: the first occurrence is 8 (1st), then 18 (2nd), ..., 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 = 8 + (49-1)*10 = 8 + 480 = 488. So, yes, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets there are. Each hundred contributes a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, each of the first four sets contributes 10 eights in the tens place, and the last set contributes 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. For the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, 9 eights in the tens place. So, yes, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nNow, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't overcount somewhere.\n\nWait, when counting the fours in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there.\n\nIn the tens place, 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours.\n\nIn the units place, 49 fours.\n\nTotal fours: 89 + 50 + 49 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor the eights:\n\nUnits place: 49 eights.\n\nTens place: 49 eights.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal eights: 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the units place for the eights. Let me check again.\n\nUnits place for eights: from 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n\nHow many terms are there? The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n\nThis is an arithmetic sequence where a1=8, d=10, and an=488.\n\nThe nth term is given by a_n = a1 + (n-1)*d.\n\nSo, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10.\n\n488 - 8 = (n-1)*10\n\n480 = (n-1)*10\n\nn-1 = 48\n\nn = 49.\n\nSo, yes, 49 eights in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for fours in the units place: 4,14,...,484.\n\nSame calculation: 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10.\n\n484 - 4 = (n-1)*10\n\n480 = (n-1)*10\n\nn-1=48\n\nn=49.\n\nSo, 49 fours in the units place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that 488 is included for eights, but for fours, 484 is the last one. So, both have 49 counts in the units place.\n\nWait, but for fours, the hundreds place is 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours there.\n\nTens place for fours: 5 sets of 10, so 50.\n\nUnits:49.\n\nTotal fours: 49+50+89=188.\n\nEights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be different, but maybe it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use a different approach to verify.\n\nAnother way to count the number of times a digit appears is to consider each digit position separately and calculate how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nFor a 488-page book, page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nLet's consider each digit position: units, tens, hundreds.\n\n**Units place:**\n\nFor each digit (0-9), the number of times it appears in the units place can be calculated as:\n\nTotal numbers = 488.\n\nFor each position, each digit appears approximately 488 / 10 = 48.8 times. But since we can't have a fraction, we need to adjust.\n\nBut actually, for the units place, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 48 times in each set of 10 numbers, except possibly the last set if it's incomplete.\n\nWait, but from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (each digit 0-9 appearing 48 times), and then the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8.\n\nSo, for digit 4 in units place: 48 times from the full cycles, plus 1 more at 484, so total 49.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8 in units place: 48 times from full cycles, plus 1 at 488, so total 49.\n\n**Tens place:**\n\nEach digit appears 10 times in each block of 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nBut for 488, which is less than 500, we have:\n\n- 1-99: each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 0-9 in 00-09, 10-19, ..., 90-99). But wait, in 1-99, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, etc., up to 9 for 90-99.\n\nSo, for 1-99, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, 100-199: same pattern, so each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\n200-299: same.\n\n300-399: same.\n\n400-488: the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last number). So, for 400-488, the tens digit is 0 (400-409), 1 (410-419), ..., 8 (480-488). Each of these has 10 numbers except the last one, which has 9 (480-488 is 9 numbers, since 488-480+1=9). Wait, no: 480-488 is 9 numbers (including both ends), so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place for 400-488.\n\nSo, for the tens place:\n\n- 1-99: 10 times each digit 0-9.\n\n- 100-199: 10 times each digit 0-9.\n\n- 200-299: 10 times each digit 0-9.\n\n- 300-399: 10 times each digit 0-9.\n\n- 400-488: digits 0-8 appear 10 times each, except 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, no. Let me correct that. For 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8, but each tens digit (0-8) appears 10 times except for the last one, which is 8, appearing 9 times because 488 is the last number.\n\nWait, no, actually, from 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which is 8, but in this case, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, but let's think carefully. From 400-409: tens digit 0 (10 numbers). 410-419: tens digit 1 (10 numbers). ... 470-479: tens digit 7 (10 numbers). 480-488: tens digit 8 (9 numbers).\n\nSo, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times, while all others (0-7) appear 10 times.\n\nSo, total for tens place:\n\nDigits 0-7: 4*10 + 10 = 50 times each? Wait, no.\n\nWait, no. From 1-399, each digit 0-9 appears 4*10 = 40 times in the tens place (since each hundred contributes 10 times per digit). Then, from 400-488, digits 0-7 appear 10 times each, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total for each digit:\n\n- Digits 0-7: 40 (from 1-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 50 times.\n\n- Digit 8: 40 (from 1-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 49 times.\n\n- Digit 9: 40 times, since 400-488 doesn't reach 490-499.\n\nWait, but 400-488 doesn't include any tens digit 9, so digit 9 in tens place is only in 1-399, which is 40 times.\n\nWait, but in our case, we're only counting digits 4 and 8, so let's focus on those.\n\nFor digit 4 in the tens place:\n\nFrom 1-399: 40 times.\n\nFrom 400-488: 10 times (since 400-409, 410-419, etc., up to 470-479, each contributing 10 numbers where tens digit is 4). Wait, no, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 times.\n\nSo, total for digit 4 in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8 in the tens place:\n\nFrom 1-399: 40 times.\n\nFrom 400-488: 9 times (480-488).\n\nSo, total for digit 8 in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n**Hundreds place:**\n\nFor hundreds place, digits can be 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nEach hundred block contributes 100 numbers with the same hundreds digit.\n\n- 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (but we're considering page numbers starting from 1, so 1-99 have hundreds digit 0, but since we're only counting digits printed, and page numbers don't have leading zeros, so hundreds digit is 0 only for numbers 1-99, but they are not printed as 001, etc., so actually, the hundreds digit is 0 only when considering three-digit numbers, but in reality, page numbers 1-99 are one or two digits, so the hundreds digit is not printed for them. Therefore, the hundreds digit is only relevant for numbers 100-488.\n\nSo, for hundreds digit:\n\n- 100-199: hundreds digit 1, 100 times.\n\n- 200-299: hundreds digit 2, 100 times.\n\n- 300-399: hundreds digit 3, 100 times.\n\n- 400-488: hundreds digit 4, 89 times (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\nSo, digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nDigit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so hundreds digit can only be 1,2,3,4. So, digit 8 in hundreds place: 0 times.\n\n**Now, summing up:**\n\nFor digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49\n\n- Tens place: 50\n\n- Hundreds place: 89\n\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49\n\n- Tens place: 49\n\n- Hundreds place: 0\n\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, so the difference is 90. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me just verify once more to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write a small table to count the occurrences.\n\nBut given the time constraints, I think the calculation is correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449). There are 5 such blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488). The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 90 more times than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, let's count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 fours in the tens place. From 40-49: 10 fours. 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets, each with 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours from each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets. From 80-89: 10 eights. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-488: how many numbers? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place for the last set. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 from 480-488. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, let me double-check that. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so total 98 eights. Now, the number of fours is 188 and eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set contributes 10, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This is 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, and the tens digit is 4. The first set is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5*10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Adding them up: Units place: 49, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. Total fours = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the 8's, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). That's 5 sets, but the last set has 9 instead of 10. So total eights in tens place: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, which is 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: Units place 49, Tens place 49, Hundreds place 0. Total eights = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: Units place: 49. Let me recount. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then every 10 numbers. So, 4,14,24,...,484. To find how many terms, it's (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct. So total fours: 49+50+89=188. For eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. Similarly, (488-8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " Let me count how many sets of 100 there are. From 1 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). How many hundreds are there? Let's see: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488. Wait, the last set is only up to 488, so the tens digit 4 in the 400s would be 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, how many hundreds have a 4 in the tens place? Each hundred except maybe the last one. Wait, let me think differently. For each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 1-400, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Well, 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is in 400-488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which would suggest 49 numbers, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence? Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because from 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets of 100 have a 8 in the tens place? Each hundred except maybe the last one. Let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, total is 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: Units place: 49, Tens place:50, Hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I overcounted in the tens place for 4's or 8's. Let me check the tens place for 4's again. From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's in 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. That seems right. For 8's in tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct. So, the difference is indeed 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449, totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488, totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

From 40-49 (first set), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets. So, 5 sets * 10 numbers per set = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have a 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in each of these numbers, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but I think I should check if 400 is included. Yes, since the book starts at page 1, so 400 is definitely included. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so integer part is 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers add one. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89 is one set (10 numbers), 180-189 is another (10), 280-289 is another (10), 380-389 is another (10), and 480-488 is the fifth set but only 9 numbers. So, for the first four sets, each contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. The last set, 480-488, contributes 9 eights in the tens place. So total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me verify the units place for 4's: from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. 484 / 10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. That seems correct. For the tens place, 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. For the eights: units place, 8 to 488, which is 488/10 = 48.8, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So 4*10 +9=49. Hundreds place: 0.

That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 5 sets, so 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.

Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. How many such numbers? Let's see, starting from 8, every 10 numbers. The last one is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? Let's divide 488 by 10: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? Each set is 10 numbers, but the last set is only 9 numbers (480-488). Let me count the number of complete sets and the partial set. The first set is 80-89: 10 numbers. Second set: 180-189: 10 numbers. Third set: 280-289: 10 numbers. Fourth set: 380-389: 10 numbers. Fifth set: 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total sets contributing to the tens place: 4 complete sets (each 10 numbers) and one partial set of 9. So, the number of eights in the tens place is 4 x 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but wait, our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " Let's count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, so each set contributes 10 fours in the tens place. How many such sets are there? From 40-49 (first set), 140-149 (second), 240-249 (third), 340-349 (fourth), and 440-449 (fifth). So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so all 5 sets are valid. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, but how many hundreds places are 4? Each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 numbers. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? Let's calculate: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours printed are 188. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but let's check if 488 is included. 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 0, 8,18,...,488. Wait, 488 is the 49th number because 488 = 8 + 10*(48-1) = 8 + 470 = 478, no, wait, that's not right. Let me think differently. The numbers are 8,18,28,...,488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + 10(n-1) = 488. Let's solve for n: 10(n-1) = 480, so n-1 = 48, so n=49. So, there are 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place being 8. Each set of 10 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count how many such sets there are. From 80-89 (first set), 180-189 (second), 280-289 (third), 380-389 (fourth), and 480-488 (fifth). Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, but the tens digit is still 8 for all of them. So, each set contributes 10 eights, but the last set only has 9 numbers. So, for the first four sets, each has 10 eights, and the fifth set has 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights printed are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For the eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer should be 90. But wait, let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct. For the tens place of fours: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. Units place for fours: from 4,14,...,484. That's 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers, correct. For eights, units place:8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, so 480/10=48, plus 1 is 49. Correct. Tens place for eights:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Correct. So, the difference is indeed 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 484 is the 49th term).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 fours, and there are 5 such sets.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 488 is the 49th term).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four sets contribute 10 eights each, and the last set contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Similarly, 240-249: 10 fours, 340-349: 10 fours, and 440-449: 10 fours. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so it's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, the book ends at 488, so 380-389 is included, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so only up to 488. So, let's see: 80-89: 10 eights. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-488: the tens digit is 8 here, but how many numbers are there? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, for 480-488, there are 9 eights. So total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

So, the first four sets are 10 each, and the last set is 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's.

    "text": " Let's see how many full sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, so 40-49 is one set, 140-149 another, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, so that's fine. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which would give 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that right? Let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place, so 10 eights. Similarly, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-488: that's from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 eights in the tens place here. So total tens place eights: 10\u00d74 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This is every 10th number, so there are 49 occurrences (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each set has 10 numbers, and there are 5 such sets, contributing 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - This range includes 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89), contributing 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Similar to 4's, there are 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four sets contribute 10 each (40 total), and 480-488 contributes 9, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me count how many full sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, so 40-49 is one set, 140-149 is another, and so on. Let me calculate how many full sets of 100 there are in 488. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these hundreds has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, except the last one. Wait, no, actually, 400-499 would have 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 440-449, which is 10 numbers, and then 450-488 doesn't have another set. Wait, no, 400-409 is the first set in the 400s, then 410-419, etc. Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me think differently. For the tens place, each hundred has exactly 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So from 1-100, 40-49: 10 numbers. From 101-200, 140-149: 10 numbers. From 201-300, 240-249: 10 numbers. From 301-400, 340-349: 10 numbers. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit can be 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 5\u00d710=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of it. So, how many sets? From 1-100: 80-89: 10 numbers. From 101-200: 180-189:10. From 201-300:280-289:10. From 301-400:380-389:10. From 401-488:480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the difference is number of fours minus number of eights: 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Let me count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, and so on. How many such sets are there? The hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. But wait, page numbers start at 1, so 0 isn't used. So, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 1-99), 1, 2, 3, or 4. But when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can be 4, but the numbers go up to 488, so 440-449 is valid, but 450-488 doesn't have 4 in the tens place. So, how many sets? For 0 in hundreds place: 40-49 (1 set). For 1 in hundreds place: 140-149 (1 set). Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets in total. Each set contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. To find the count, I can divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48. But wait, 488 is included, so let me check: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is valid. Let me count how many sets there are. For hundreds digit 0: 80-89 (1 set). Hundreds digit 1: 180-189 (1 set). Similarly, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets. Each set contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last set, which is only 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 eights in the tens place, and the last set (480-488) has 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the tens place for eights again. When I considered the tens place, I had 5 sets: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40 eights. The last set, 480-488, is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. That seems correct. Similarly, for fours in the tens place, I had 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Wait, but when I considered the hundreds place for fours, I had 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. Let me confirm that: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. Yes, that's correct. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Eights: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Wait, let me check: 80-89: 10. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 5 sets of 10, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as pages go up to 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me calculate how many full sets there are. Each set has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, and so on. How many such sets are there? The hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. Wait, but 0 in the hundreds digit would be the single-digit numbers, but the tens digit is 4, so numbers like 40-49 are two-digit numbers. So, from 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, does 488 count? Yes, because the units digit is 8. So, how many such numbers? The last one is 488. Let's see: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 8,18,...,488. How many terms? Let's calculate: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488. So, each set of 10 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count how many full sets we have. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 9 numbers (480-488). So, the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 eights in the tens place, and the last set (480-488) has 9 eights. So total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) -98 (eights)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in sets like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each set has 10 numbers, and there are 5 such sets.\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in sets like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - First four sets have 10 each, and the last set (480-488) has 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

The first set is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 fours per set = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? 449 is less than 488, so yes, that set is included. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the fours from each place: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers are there? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 0. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the last set. Let's count how many full sets there are. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights. Now, the last set would be 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. Each of these has an 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 eights. So, total in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up the eights from each place: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights in total.

From 100-199: 140-149: 10 numbers. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249: 10 numbers. 300-399: 340-349: 10 numbers. 400-488: 440-449: 10 numbers. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place.

I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me check how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Yes, because 8, 18, ..., 488 is 49 numbers.

So, that's 4 sets with 10 each and 1 set with 9. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. So, numbers from 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.

So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the tens place being 8, but let's check how many numbers that is. Each set from 80-89, 180-189, etc., has 10 numbers, except possibly the last one if it goes beyond 488. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: how many? 488 - 480 +1 = 9 numbers. So, the first four sets have 10 each, and the last set has 9. So total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. Wait, no: 80-89 is the first set, then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five sets, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, 4 sets with 10 and 1 set with 9. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90.

Wait, no, actually, 400-488 is part of the fifth hundred. Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each hundred block (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, from 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. So that's 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's would be 40 + 10 = 50.

The number of terms can be calculated as follows: The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The common difference is 10. The formula for the nth term is a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d. So, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 8: 480 = (n-1)*10. Divide by 10: 48 = n-1. So, n = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the tens digit being 8, right? Let's count how many full hundreds have 80-89. From 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. Therefore, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up the eights from each place: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. This totals 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. This totals 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book doesn't reach 800.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me count how many full decades there are. Each decade (like 0-99, 100-199, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 0-99: 40-49: 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149: 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249: 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349: 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449: 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 sets of 10 numbers each, so 5\u00d710=50 fours in the tens place. Hmm, but wait, let me check 440-449: that's 10 numbers, so yes, 50 in total. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which would give 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence? Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Let me count how many full decades there are. From 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189: 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289: 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389: 10 numbers. From 400-488: 480-488: 9 numbers. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4\u00d710=40 and 1\u00d79=9, total 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488 \u2192 0 times.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Each set contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, the book ends at 488, so does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total.

Yes, but since the book ends at 488, that set is only up to 488. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89 is the first set (10 numbers), 180-189 is the second, 280-289 is the third, 380-389 is the fourth, and 480-488 is the fifth set. Each of the first four sets contributes 10 eights in the tens place, but the fifth set (480-488) has 9 numbers (from 480 to 488 inclusive), so only 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 from the fifth set, totaling 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can only have 8 if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.

Wait, but 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 4\u00d710 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four sets contribute 10 each, and the last set contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me count how many sets of 100 there are. From 1-488, the tens place has 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these sets has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Wait, but I think I'm making a mistake here. The hundreds place is only the first digit, so from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, no, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, moving on to counting the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last occurrence is at 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, which would give 48 eights. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 eights in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the 49th number where the units digit is 8. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but wait: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480,481,...,488. So, yes, 9. So, total tens place eights: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 4's is 188, and total number of 8's is 98. Now, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me recount the fours and eights.\n\nFor fours:\n- Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, step 10. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n- Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each 10, so 50. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct. Total fours: 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor eights:\n- Units place: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10. So, (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n- Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: none. So, total eights:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights. Hmm, that seems correct. I think my initial calculation was right. So, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of '4's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** The digit '4' appears in every 10th number, starting from 4 up to 484.

So, from 40-49: 10 fours, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is included. So, starting from 8, each set of 10 has one 8 in the units place. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 40+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is another 10, 380-389 is another 10, and 480-488 is 9. So yes, 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, does 488 count? Yes, because 488 is the last page. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488.

Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, and the last set has 9. So, total tens place eights: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more fours than eights. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488-400=88, but since we include both endpoints, it's 89. So, that's correct. For the tens place in fours, I had 5 sets, each 10 numbers, so 50. Units place in fours: 49, correct because 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. For eights: units place, same as fours, 49. Tens place: 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, so 49. So, yes, 98 eights. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " Let me count how many full sets of 100 there are. From 1-488, the hundreds digits go up to 4. So, the tens place 4 occurs in each hundred block. For each hundred block (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). How many such blocks are there? Let's see: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. Wait, 401-488 is only part of the fifth block. But for the tens digit, the 4's occur in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's five sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up the fours in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first is 8, the last is 488. To count how many, I can divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: starting at 8, each 10 numbers add one more. So, 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 fall within 488? Yes, 480-488. So, let's see how many full sets we have. Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 1-488, how many such blocks? Let's list them: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 9 numbers: 480-488. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights in each place: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) =90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. There are 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. There are 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place within 1-488. Occurrences: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Similarly, 240-249 and 340-349 each add 10. Then, 440-449 is another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count each set: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of fours is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total.

So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, total fours are 188, total eights are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yes, that seems right.

So, 5*10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.

So, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.

Each set contributes 10 fours, so 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is fully included. Since the book goes up to 488, 440-449 is okay because 449 is less than 488. So yes, 5 sets, 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.

Similarly, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10, and 480-488: how many? 480-488 is 9 numbers, so only 9 eights in the tens place here.

    "text": " Let's see how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, so each set contributes 10 fours in the tens place. How many such sets are there? From 0-488, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets. Each set has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488? Yes, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, so each set contributes 10 eights in the tens place. How many such sets? From 0-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 sets. Each set has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits that are 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49+40=89. So, total number of 8's is 89. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (number of 4's) - 89 (number of 8's) = 99. So, there are 99 more 4's than 8's printed in the book.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in sets like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 fours, and there are 5 such sets.\n   - Number of occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in sets like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389.\n   - Each set contributes 10 eights, and there are 4 such sets.\n   - Number of occurrences: 40.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **89**.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 89 = **99**.\n\n$\\boxed{99}$"

    "text": " Let's see how many full decades there are. Each set of 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 4. From 1-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). So, that's 5 sets of 10 numbers each, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But we're only concerned with the hundreds digit being 4, so each of these numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check again. Wait, units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. So, 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188? That seems high. Wait, but let me think again. From 1-488, how many fours are there? Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the units place. Let me recount the units place. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so in 488 numbers, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 fours. Then, the last partial group from 481-488 has 484, which is another 4 in the units place, making it 49. So, units place: 49 fours. Tens place: Each hundred has a block of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so from 1-488, how many such blocks? 1-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). 100-199: 140-149 (10). 200-299: 240-249 (10). 300-399: 340-349 (10). 400-488: 440-449 (10). So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, we'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) + 1. So, ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many full blocks we have. From 1-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the hundreds place, we have 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers, except for the last hundred (400-488), where it's only 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer is 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly? For fours, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. For eights, in the hundreds place, there are none, so 0. Units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 49 eights. So, total eights: 98. Fours: 188. So, difference is 90. But wait, let me check the tens place for eights again. From 1-99: 80-89 (10). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488 (9). So, that's 4*10 +9=49. So, yes, 49 in tens place. Units place: same as fours, 49. So, total eights: 98. Fours: 188. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a big number. Let me think differently. Maybe I can use a formula or another method to verify. Alternatively, I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position. For units digit: In any range, the number of times a digit appears in the units place is floor((n + 1) / 10). So, for 4 in units place up to 488: floor((488 +1)/10)=floor(489/10)=48.9, so 48 times. But wait, earlier I thought it was 49. Hmm, perhaps this formula is slightly different. Wait, the formula is usually (n // 10) + 1 if the digit is less than the current digit in that place. Wait, maybe I should think differently. Let me use the formula for digit counting. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to n is: (n // 10) + 1 if d <= (n % 10) else (n // 10). So, for 4 in units place up to 488: n=488, d=4. n%10=8. Since 4 <=8, so it's (488//10) +1=48+1=49. So, that matches my earlier count. Similarly, for 8 in units place: same calculation. n=488, d=8. n%10=8, so (488//10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place counts are correct: 49 fours, 49 eights. For tens place: The formula is similar. The number of times d appears in the tens place up to n is: (n // 100) * 10 + min(max(d, (n % 100) // 10), 9) if d <= (n % 100) //10 else (n //100)*10 + 10. Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of higher digits. For the tens place, each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is d. So, for 4 in tens place: from 1-488, how many hundreds blocks? 4 full hundreds (1-400), and then 400-488. For each full hundred, 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. So, 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit can be 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 40+10=50. Similarly, for 8 in tens place: each full hundred contributes 10 numbers where tens digit is 8. So, 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit can be 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total 40+9=49. So, that confirms the earlier counts: 50 fours in tens place, 49 eights in tens place. For hundreds place: For 4 in hundreds place, it's from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. For 8 in hundreds place, since 800-899 is beyond 488, it's 0. So, hundreds place: 89 fours, 0 eights. So, total fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188. Total eights:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98. Difference:188-98=90. So, yes, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences (8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full blocks and a partial block (480-488), totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me count how many sets of ten there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one set (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 is another set (10 numbers). Similarly, 240-249 (10 numbers), 340-349 (10 numbers), and 440-449 (10 numbers). So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up the fours from each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add them: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, I need to count the number of 8's. Let's do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. To find how many, I can divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because it's 8 in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets: From 0-99: 80-89 is one set (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 is another set (10 numbers). Similarly, 280-289 (10 numbers), 380-389 (10 numbers), and 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the first four sets give 4 sets * 10 = 40 eights, and the last set gives 9 eights. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, the total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49. Total 98. So, difference is 90. Hmm, that seems right. I think I accounted for all the cases.

    "text": " Let's see: From 0-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Each hundred has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, in 1-99: 40-49, that's 10 numbers. In 100-199: 140-149, another 10. In 200-299: 240-249, another 10. In 300-399: 340-349, another 10. In 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10. So, total tens place 4's: 10 (from 40-49) + 10 (140-149) + 10 (240-249) + 10 (340-349) + 10 (440-449) = 50. But wait, 440-449 is only 10 numbers, but the book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is fine.

So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's.

So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the book. So, let's count each hundred: - 1-99: 80-89, which is 10 numbers. - 100-199: 180-189, another 10. - 200-299: 280-289, another 10. - 300-399: 380-389, another 10. - 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.

Then 140-149, another 10, 240-249, another 10, 340-349, another 10, and 440-449, another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, let me double-check that. 400 is the first, 401, 402,... up to 488. So, 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many 8's in the units place? The first is 8, then 18, 28,..., 488. Let's see how many numbers that is. The last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count the sets. First set: 80-89 (10 numbers), second: 180-189 (10), third: 280-289 (10), fourth: 380-389 (10), fifth: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, the first four sets have 10 each, and the fifth set has 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more fours than eights there are: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484), totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in sets like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in numbers 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488), totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in sets like 80-89, 180-189, etc., but the last set (480-488) has only 9 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any hundreds place within 1-488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
