    "text": " So, how many sets of 100 are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, in each of these sets, except maybe the last one, the tens place will have 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Let's count: - 40-49: 10 numbers - 140-149: 10 numbers - 240-249: 10 numbers - 340-349: 10 numbers - 440-449: 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds place has 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to fours, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, which is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, it's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place has 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be the next set, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets: - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189: 10 numbers - 280-289: 10 numbers - 380-389: 10 numbers - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 4 sets with 10 each and one set with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set contributes 10, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This totals 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers reach 800, so 0.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Then, each of these sets has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such sets there are: - 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, that's 89 numbers where the hundreds digit is 4. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8. So, 48 full sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many sets: - 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nWait, so the first four sets each have 10 numbers, and the last set has 9 numbers because it goes up to 488. So, total tens place eights: 4\u00d710 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800 and 899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   - 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   - Total occurrences: 49 (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 4 appears in sets like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   - Total sets: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).  \n   - Each set has 10 numbers, so total occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.  \n   - Total numbers: 89 (488 - 400 + 1).  \n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   - 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   - Total occurrences: 49 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 8 appears in sets like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   - The first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 numbers.  \n   - The last set (480-488) has 9 numbers.  \n   - Total occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 8 does not appear in any page number since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, how many sets of ten are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first set, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets. Each set has 10 numbers, so 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place is where the number is in the hundreds. So, 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because it's included. Wait, 488 is 488, which is 48\u00d710 + 8, so that's the 49th 8 in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. How many sets? 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. That's 5 sets. Each set except the last one has 10 numbers. The last set, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, 4 sets \u00d710 = 40, plus 9 in the last set, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, no. Let me think again. Each full set (80-89, 180-189, etc.) contributes 10 eights in the tens place. There are 4 full sets: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4\u00d710=40. Then, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So total in tens place: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits with 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49 (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in sets like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in sets like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - There are 4 full sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 numbers, and the last set 480-488 contributes 9 numbers.\n   - Total occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers reach 800, so no 8's here.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n- 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** There are **90** more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

From 40-49: that's one set, then 140-149: another, 240-249: another, 340-349: another, and 440-449: another. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that?

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights in total.

    "text": " Each of these sets contributes 10 fours in the tens place. How many such sets are there? From 40-49: 10 numbers, then each hundred block adds another 10. So, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188 fours in total. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, and then an extra 8 numbers (481-488), which include another 4 at 484. So, 48 + 1 = 49 fours in the units place. That's correct. Tens place: as I thought, 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: 89 fours. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Okay, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. How many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, and then the 49th set includes 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these sets contributes 10 eights in the tens place. How many such sets are there? From 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights. So, 4 x 10 = 40 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: the book goes up to 488, so after 380-389, the next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, does that count as a full set? Let's see: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for all of them, but the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many eights in the tens place here? From 480-488, that's 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, in addition to the four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), we have another 9 eights in the tens place from 480-488. So, total tens place eights: 4 x 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, no, that's not right. Because the 480-488 is part of the hundreds place as 4, but in the tens place, it's 8. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, the tens place eights would be: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. Okay, so 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, but let me check again. Units place: 49 eights, tens place: 49 eights, so total 98 eights. Now, the number of fours was 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I feel like that's a big difference. Let me see if I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. That seems correct. For eights, in the tens place, I counted 49, but wait, let me recount. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. Units place: 49, correct. So, eights total 98. Fours total 188. So, difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (from 4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in sets like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (from 8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in sets like 80-89, 180-189, etc., plus 480-488, totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, how many sets are there? Each set is 10 numbers, and each set contributes 10 fours in the tens place. From 40-49: 10 fours. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5\u00d710=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but does 400 count? Yes, because it's the start of the range. So, total fours in hundreds place: 89. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me check how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but does 488 count? Yes, because 488 is the last number. So, 488 is the 49th occurrence in the units place. Wait, but let me think: 8, 18, ..., 488. How many terms? The formula for the number of terms is ((last - first)/step) + 1. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, the first four sets contribute 10 each, so 4\u00d710=40. The last set contributes 9. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no hundreds digits of 8 in this book. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. This is 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488.

    "text": " So, how many sets of 100 are there? From 1-488, there are four sets: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, actually, 400-488 is part of the same hundred set. Let me think differently. Each hundred has a set where the tens digit is 4. So, 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). But since the book ends at 488, 440-449 is still within 488. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, then 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours printed. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. How many such numbers are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48 full groups of 10, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers, but wait, 89 is within 488, so that's 10 eights. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: here, 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, total eights in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Then, each of these sets contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such sets are there? Let's see: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's fine. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in the numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, starting from 8, each set of 10 has one 8 in the units place. The number of such numbers is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full sets. But wait, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in sets like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 exist? Since the book goes up to 488, yes, 480-488 is part of the book. So, each of these sets contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count the sets: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, does that mean the tens place 8's are 4 sets with 10 each and one set with 9? Let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 4x10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but wait a second. When we look at 480-488, the tens digit is 8, so each number from 480 to 488 has an 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 8's. Let me recount that. The tens place for 8's occurs in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, which is 49. Yes, that's correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Then, how many sets of ten are there? From 40-49: that's one set. Then each subsequent hundred adds another set. So, 40-49: 10 numbers. 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does the 440-449 set go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to fours, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me check the last occurrence: 488 is the last page, which has an 8 in the units place. So, how many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full steps, but including both 8 and 488, so that's 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: 8 is the first, then 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let me check: Each hundred has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, starting from 80-89: that's 10 numbers. Then 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Then, 480-488: how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, in the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. Wait, but let me make sure. Each hundred up to 380-389 contributes 10 eights. Then, 480-489 would be another 10, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9: 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800 or above. But since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, each set from 1-399 contributes 10 eights, and the last set (400-488) contributes 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets * 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights printed are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, how many sets of 100 are there? From 1-488, we have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. Wait, but the tens place 4 occurs in each hundred block. So, each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, for each hundred, that's 10 fours. How many hundreds do we have? Well, up to 488, that's 4 full hundreds (1-400) and then 401-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, we have 10 fours in the tens place. That's 4*10 = 40 fours. Now, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's another 10 fours. So, total tens place fours are 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 89 numbers. So, hundreds place has 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the last 8 in the units place is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the book, so let's count. Each hundred block (except maybe the last one) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-400, we have 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10 = 40. Now, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, but wait: in the 480-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for all those numbers, right? So, 480 has tens digit 8, 481, etc., up to 488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is the 9th number after 480. So, yes, 9 eights in the tens place from 480-488. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding them up: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms can be calculated by (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check up to 488. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10. Wait, does 480-489 count? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. However, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 in 480-488 is present. So, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, each of these has 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place for the 480-488 range. Therefore, total tens place eights: 4 sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, so 4x10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding them up: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights in total.

So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.

So, how many such numbers? Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The first is 8, and the last is 488. To find how many, I can calculate (488 - 8)/10 + 1. That's (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-489 would be the next set, but the book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets there are. Each set from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place. Then, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, for the tens place, we have 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40 eights, plus 9 eights from 480-488. So, total of 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

    "text": " Then, how many sets of 100 are there? From 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, for the tens place, each hundred has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these sets contributes 10 fours in the tens place. How many such sets are there? From 40-49, that's one set; then each subsequent hundred adds another set. So, how many hundreds are there up to 488? Well, 488 is in the 400-488 range, which is the fifth hundred. So, from 1-488, there are five sets where the tens digit is 4. Each set has 10 numbers, so 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm. For example, in 40-49, that's 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149 is another 10, and so on up to 440-449. So, yes, 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours in total. Now, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Let's go through each digit place again. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so it's actually 49 numbers. Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because from 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, 480-489 would be another set, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book stops at 488, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (from 480 to 488 inclusive). So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 full sets and one partial set. Each full set contributes 10 eights in the tens place. The partial set contributes 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me think again. From 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights in tens place. Similarly, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4\u00d710 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights in total. So, the number of fours is 188 and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's five sets. Each set has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in the numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? The formula for the number of times a digit appears in the units place up to N is floor((N + 1)/10). So, for N=488, floor((488+1)/10) = floor(489/10) = 48. So, 48 fours in the units place. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 49. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there. Let me recalculate. The numbers where the units digit is 4 are 4,14,24,...,484. So, the first is 4, and the last is 484. How many terms? The difference between 484 and 4 is 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 gives 49. So, 49 fours in the units place. But according to the formula, floor((488+1)/10) = 48. There's a discrepancy here. Let me check with smaller numbers. For example, up to 14: numbers are 4,14. That's 2 numbers. Using the formula, floor((14+1)/10) = 1.5 \u2192 1, which is incorrect because there are 2 fours. So, maybe the formula isn't directly applicable here. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate as (488 // 10) + 1 if the remainder is >=4? Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. Since 8 >=4, we add 1, so 48 +1 =49. So, that aligns with the manual count. So, units place has 49 fours. Tens place: For the tens digit, each set of 100 has a block where the tens digit is 4. So, from 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers), 100-199:140-149 (10), 200-299:240-249 (10), 300-399:340-349 (10), and 400-488:440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5\u00d710=50 fours in the tens place. Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. The difference between 488 and 8 is 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. Alternatively, using the formula: floor((488 +1)/10) =48.9 \u219248, but since 488 ends with 8, which is >=8, so we add 1, making it 49. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set. - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189:10. - 280-289:10. - 380-389:10. - 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, total eights in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check. Units place:49, tens place:49, so total eights:98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set contributes 10 fours, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 numbers here.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four sets contribute 10 each, and the last set contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers here, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, each set of 100 numbers contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let's see how many sets we have. From 1-99: 40-49, that's 10 fours. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me think again. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours here. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8 can appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, which would give 48 eights. But wait, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these sets contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except maybe the last one because 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, from 480 to 489 would be 10 numbers, but since our book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, let's see: From 1-99: 80-89, that's 10 eights. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in sets like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each set contributes 10 fours, with 5 such sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in sets like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each set contributes 10 eights, except the last set (480-488), which contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers in 800-899 exist, so 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, how many sets of ten are there where the tens digit is 4? Let's see: 40-49 is the first set, which is 10 numbers. Then, each subsequent hundred will have another set. So, from 100-199: 140-149, that's another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many sets? That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is 10, 240-249 is 10, 340-349 is 10, and 440-449 is 10. Yes, that's 5 sets, so 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Let's count the number of 8's in each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. Let me see how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is 8, then every 10 numbers after that. So, the number of 8's in the units place is equal to the number of times 8 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. To find this, I can calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488, which is 48 full groups (since 48 x 10 = 480), and then check if there's an extra number beyond that. Wait, 488 is 48 x 10 + 8, so the 48th group ends at 480, and then we have 481-488. So, the number of 8's in the units place is 48 (from 8, 18, ..., 478) plus 1 more from 488, making it 49. Wait, but let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 478, 488. That's 49 numbers because 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit can be 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is within the book's pages. So, how many sets of ten have 8 in the tens place? Let's see: 80-89 is one set, 180-189 is another, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). But in the tens place, each set normally has 10 numbers, but the last set might be shorter. So, for 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, the number of 8's in the tens place is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's are printed, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.

    "text": " Wait, no, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. Let's count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, so for each hundred, there's one set of 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. From 1-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but wait, from 400-488, the last set is 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 5 sets. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, which would give 48 eights, but wait, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets there are. From 1-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 is the last page. So, how many eights in the tens place? Each of the first four sets contributes 10 eights, so 4 x 10 = 40. The last set, 480-488, has 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are there than 8's. So, 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " So, how many sets are there? Each set contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. The first set is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is fully included in 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Let's count the number of 8's in each digit position. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8's appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last occurrence is at 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many sets there are. The first set is 80-89 (10 numbers), then 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. The last set, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, the first four sets contribute 10 each, so 4*10=40, and the last set contributes 9. So, total eights in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is another 10, 380-389 is another 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 to 899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Each set contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, except maybe the last set because 400-488 might not go up to 449. Wait, no, 440-449 is within 488, so it's fine. So, each of these sets (except maybe the first one, but 40-49 is in 1-99) contributes 10 numbers. So, 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: 10, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, 440-449: 10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, right? So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see, the last number with an 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many such numbers? Starting at 8, every 10 numbers. So, 8,18,28,...,488. To find how many, I can take 488 and divide by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: 8*1=8, 8*2=16, but wait, actually, it's every 10 numbers. So, the first is 8, then 18, 28,..., 488. So, how many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, (n-1)*10 = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is within 488, so that's okay. So, each of these sets contributes 10 numbers, except the last one, 480-488, which is only 9 numbers because 480-489 would be 10, but the book stops at 488. Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, how many tens places? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, total eights in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, total fours are 188, total eights are 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " So, how many sets are there? Each set is 10 numbers, so from 40-49, that's 10 numbers, then 140-149 is another 10, and so on. The number of sets is determined by how many times 40 is reached before 488. Let's see: 40, 140, 240, 340, 440. Each of these is a set of 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total fours would be units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit can be 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets are there? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, the first four sets are 10 numbers each, and the last set is 9 numbers. So, total eights in the tens place are 4 x 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights are units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: Units: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that's 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me check the tens place for eights again. I think I might have made a mistake there. The tens place for eights: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. And units place: 49 eights. So, 49+49=98.

    "text": " So, how many sets are there? Each set is 10 numbers, so 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, and so on. Let's see how many full sets there are. The first set is 40-49: 10 numbers. The next is 140-149: 10 numbers. Then 240-249: 10 numbers. Then 340-349: 10 numbers. Then 440-449: 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me double-check. The tens place is the second digit. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in the hundreds place, for each hundred, the tens digit is 4 once every 100 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many hundreds do we have? 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, in each hundred except the last one, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, 1-99: 40-49: 10 numbers. 100-199: 140-149: 10 numbers. 200-299: 240-249: 10 numbers. 300-399: 340-349: 10 numbers. Now, 400-488: the tens digit is 4 for 440-449: 10 numbers. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is 488, which is the 49th multiple of 10 after 8. So, 488 is the 49th number with 8 in the units place. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the last set. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10 numbers. 280-289: 10 numbers. 380-389: 10 numbers. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 full sets (each contributing 10) and one partial set with 9. So, total in tens place: 4 x 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no hundreds digits of 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems correct?

Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. But the book goes up to 488, so the last set would be 380-389. Each set contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, how many sets? 80-89: 10 eights. 180-189: 10 eights. 280-289: 10 eights. 380-389: 10 eights. That's 4 sets, so 4*10=40 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (40) = 89. So, total eights are 89. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 89 eights = 99. So, there are 99 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. This is 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. This is 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. This is 40 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 40 = 89.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 89 (8's) = 99.\n\n$\\boxed{99}$"

    "text": " So, how many sets of 100 are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first set, 140-149 the second, 240-249 the third, 340-349 the fourth, and 440-449 the fifth. Each set contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours from each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? Let's divide 488 by 10, which gives 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48, but including 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each set contributes 10 eights. Now, the book goes up to 488, so the last set is 380-389. Let me count how many sets: 80-89 (first), 180-189 (second), 280-289 (third), 380-389 (fourth). So, 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is 800 or above. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights from each place: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, there are 89 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (fours) - 89 (eights) = 99. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 40, hundreds 0. 49+40=89. So, 188-89=99. Hmm, maybe that's correct. But wait, let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, correct. And the tens place for fours: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, so 5\u00d710=50. Units place for fours: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, every 10 numbers, so 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place 8,18,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's 4 sets, so 4\u00d710=40. So, 49+40=89. So, 188-89=99. Yeah, that seems correct.

So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours from each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of fours is 188.

So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of eights is 98. Now, the question is how many more fours are there than eights. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90.

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first, 401, 402,..., up to 488. So, 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: Units (49) + Tens (50) + Hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so it's 49 numbers. Wait, but wait: from 1-488, the numbers ending with 8 are 8,18,...,488. Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full tens, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each set contributes 10 eights except the last one, which is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Let me break it down: From 1-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 eights. From 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 eights. From 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 eights. From 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 eights. From 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 eights (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets with 10 eights each and 1 set with 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only if the page number is 800 or above. But since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the hundreds place with 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: Units: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Each set contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit):** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit):** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit):** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four sets contribute 10 each, and the last set contributes 9. Total: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit):** No page numbers reach 800, so 0 occurrences.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Then, each of these sets contributes 10 fours in the tens place. How many such sets are there? From 40-49, that's one set, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 fours each = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in units? Well, every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, which is 48\u00d71=48, plus the 4 in 484, which is the 49th. So, 49 fours in units. Tens place: as above, 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5\u00d710=50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in hundreds, so 89. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.

The last occurrence is at 488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, which is 48\u00d71=48, plus the 8 in 488, which is the 49th. So, 49 eights in units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. So, each set contributes 10 eights, except the last one, which only goes up to 488, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers. So, how many full sets? Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 eights\n- 180-189: 10 eights\n- 280-289: 10 eights\n- 380-389: 10 eights\n- 480-488: 9 eights\n\nSo, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check again. From 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For units place, 8 appears 49 times, same as 4. For tens place, I have 49 eights. So, total eights: 98.\n\nNow, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct?

Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, no: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, how many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488. So, 8 + 10(n-1) \u2264 488 \u2192 10(n-1) \u2264 480 \u2192 n-1 \u2264 48 \u2192 n \u2264 49. So, 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place has 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? Each hundred block contributes a set of 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Let's count: 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers) 101-200: 180-189 (10) 201-300: 280-289 (10) 301-400: 380-389 (10) 401-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, is that correct? Wait, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the first four sets contribute 10 each, and the last set contributes 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 484 is the 49th occurrence).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in sets like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such sets (including 440-449 within 401-488).\n   - Number of occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89 (from 400 to 488 inclusive).\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in sets like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each set contributes 10 numbers except the last set, which contributes 9 (480-488).\n   - Number of occurrences: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can only have 4 in the numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, then 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll check each place: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? 488 - 8 = 480, and then 480 / 10 = 48, but since we include both endpoints, it's 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count the sets: 80-89 (1 set), 180-189 (2nd set), 280-289 (3rd set), 380-389 (4th set), and 480-488 (5th set). Each of the first four sets contributes 10 eights, but the last set, 480-488, only has 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). Wait, 488 - 480 = 8, so 8 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, the first four sets give 4 * 10 = 40 eights, and the last set gives 9 eights. So total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

Each set has 10 numbers, so 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so it's valid. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in the numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's.

So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 80-89 is valid, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and also 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of the tens place 8. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89 is one set, 180-189 is another, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 numbers, and the last set (480-488) has 9 numbers. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 from the last set, totaling 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488.

Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so each contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, I need to count the number of 8's in the same way. Let's go through each digit position. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488.

So, that's 4 sets with 10 numbers and one set with 9 numbers. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits that are 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the last 8 in the units place is at 488. So, how many numbers? Starting from 8, then 18, 28,...,488. That's 49 numbers because 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers, since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights would be units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems off because 188-98 is 90, but I think I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me double-check the counts. For fours: Units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many? Let's calculate: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488. How many numbers? 488-400+1=89. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: Units place: from 8,18,...,488. Let's calculate: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10),180-189 (10),280-289 (10),380-389 (10),480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have missed something. Let me check the tens place for eights again. When counting 480-488, that's 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488, which is 9 numbers. So, 5 sets in tens place: 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. That seems correct. So, 98 eights. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check: 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so from 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488-400+1=89 numbers. Correct. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Eights: 49+49=98. So, difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but I'm getting 90, but I think the correct answer is 90. But wait, let me think again. Wait, when counting the hundreds place for fours, is it 89? Because 400 is the first, then 401, up to 488. So, 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. Yes, correct. So, 89 fours in hundreds place. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Eights: units 49, tens 49, total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, it's easy to miscount. Let me try another approach. Maybe using a formula or a more systematic way. For each digit position, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor((488)/10) +1 if 488 >=4. Since 488 >=4, it's floor(488/10)=48, plus 1 if the last number is >=4. Since 488 ends with 8, which is greater than 4, so we add 1. So, 48+1=49. Similarly, for 8's: floor(488/10)=48, and since 488 ends with 8, which is equal to 8, so we add 1. So, 48+1=49.\n\nFor tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: We look at how many full groups of 100 there are, and then the partial group. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For 488, the number of complete hundreds is 4 (0-399). Each complete hundred contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, 4*10=40. Now, in the incomplete hundred (400-488), the tens digit can be 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 40+10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place: Each complete hundred contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4*10=40. In the incomplete hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, total tens place 8's: 40+9=49.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nNumber of 8's: The hundreds digit is 8 from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 188.\n\nTotal eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n\nBut wait, I just realized that when counting the hundreds place for fours, I included 400-488, which is correct because the hundreds digit is 4. So, 89 fours there. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is 188, and the digit 8 appears 98 times.

    "text": " Then, each of these sets contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such sets there are. The first set is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check the last set: 440-449 is within 488, so yes, 5 sets. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is indeed 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, I need to count the number of 8's. Let me go through each digit place again. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers with 8 in the units place? The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms can be found by (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me check each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights. - 180-189: 10 eights. - 280-289: 10 eights. - 380-389: 10 eights. - 480-488: Here, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, each set contributes 10 except the last one, which contributes 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is another 10, 380-389 is another 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for the fours:\n\n- Units place: 49 fours. Let me recount: from 4, 14, ..., 484. The formula is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 480/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 5 sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). Each set has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nTotal fours: 49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nNow, for the eights:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10. Number of terms: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0. Correct.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference between their counts.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10 numbers starting from 4 up to 484. The count is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49 times.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488. The count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 times.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The count is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49 times.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges each contribute 10 numbers, and the last range contributes 9 (since 488 is the last page). Total: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's - Number of '8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, each of these sets has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such sets there are. From 40-49: that's one set, then 140-149: another, 240-249: another, 340-349: another, and 440-449: another. So that's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm that 440-449 is within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. Wait, no, the hundreds digit is 4 in 400-499, but since our book only goes up to 488, it's 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit 8 will appear at 488. Let me count how many times. The first occurrence is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. To find how many numbers, I can divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, 48, but wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count the sets. 80-89: that's one set, 180-189: another, 280-289: another, 380-389: another, and 480-488: which is 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, and the last set has 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 sets * 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. Wait, but wait, let me check. 80-89: 10 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in sets like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Number of sets: 5, each contributing 10 numbers.\n   - Total occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89 (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in sets like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four sets contribute 40, and the last set contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n   - Occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 numbers = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in these numbers, the hundreds digit is 4, so each of these numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me confirm: 400 is included, so 400-488 is 89 numbers. Yes, that's correct. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, let me add up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last occurrence in the units place is 488. So, how many such numbers? Let's see: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, the first is 8, then 18, ..., 488. To find how many terms, I can compute (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389:10, 480-488: 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, let's add up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, when counting the units place for 4's, I initially thought 49, but let me confirm. From 4 to 484, that's 484 - 4 = 480, divided by 10 gives 48, plus 1 gives 49. That's correct.\n\nFor the tens place, 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each set is 10 numbers, and there are 5 sets, so 5\u00d710=50. That's correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. That's correct.\n\nSo, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nFor the eights:\n\nUnits place: 8, 18, ..., 488. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, (488 - 8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49.

The last occurrence is 488, so dividing 488 by 10 gives 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. Wait, no, because 488 is the last page. So, from 8 to 488, every 10 pages, so 488/10 = 48.8, which means 49 times.

So, each of the first four sets contributes 10 eights, and the last set contributes 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.

    "text": " So, how many sets are there? Each set is 10 numbers, and each set contributes 10 fours in the tens place. From 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 fours. Similarly, 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so yes, that's valid. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400-488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the tens place. Wait, when counting the tens place, from 40-49: 10 fours. Then 140-149: another 10, that's 20. Then 240-249: 30, 340-349: 40, and 440-449: 50. So that's correct, 50 fours in the tens place. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. Let me count how many numbers: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 +1 = 49. So that's correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** The 8's in the units place occur at 8,18,28,...,488. Let me see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8's in the tens place occur in sets like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, since the book goes up to 488, 380-389 is valid, but 480-489 would go beyond 488. So, how many sets? 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights. 180-189: another 10, so 20. 280-289: another 10, 30. 380-389: another 10, 40. So, 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (40) = 89 eights. Wait, that's 49+40=89. So, total eights are 89. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 89. So, 188 - 89 = 99. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 40, hundreds 0. 49+40=89. So, 188 -89=99. Hmm, seems correct. So, there are 99 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set contributes 10 fours, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, giving 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

    "text": " So, each set from 40-49, 140-149, etc., contributes 10 fours in the tens place. How many such sets are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first set, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets. Each set has 10 numbers, so 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can only have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would normally be 10 numbers, but here we only go up to 488, so that's 9 numbers (480-488). Let me count the sets: 80-89 is the first set, contributing 10 eights. Then 180-189, another 10. 280-289, another 10. 380-389, another 10. Now, 480-488 is the fifth set, but only 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 fours, and there are 5 sets.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 89 (488 - 400 + 1).\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four sets contribute 10 eights each (40 total).\n   - 480-488 contributes 9 eights.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No pages in 800-899.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, no, 488 is the last page, so after 440-449, the next would be 540-549, but since 540 is beyond 488, we don't have that. So, how many sets are there? Each set is 10 numbers. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers, then 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So, 5 sets, 10 each, so 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8's appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last occurrence is 488. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the units place. The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms? The first term is 8, which is 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-489 would be 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total is 10*4 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98 eights. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems like a lot, but let me double-check my counts. For fours: units place: 4,14,...,484: that's 484/10=48.4, but since it's inclusive, it's 49. Tens place: 40-49,140-149, etc., up to 440-449: that's 5 sets, each 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488: 49. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,...,480-488: 49. Hundreds: 0. So, 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 484 \u00f7 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in sets like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such sets.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of pages: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 \u00f7 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in sets like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each set contributes 10 occurrences, except the last set which has 9.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"
