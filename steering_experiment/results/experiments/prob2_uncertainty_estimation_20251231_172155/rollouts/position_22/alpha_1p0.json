    "text": " Let me count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers. So, from 40-49 is one set, 140-149 is another, and so on up to 440-449. How many such sets are there? Let's see: 40-49 (1), 140-149 (2), 240-249 (3), 340-349 (4), 440-449 (5). So, 5 sets. Each set contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so that's 5*10=50 fours. But wait, does 440-449 count fully? Since 449 is less than 488, yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, there are 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit position. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last set. Let me count the number of sets: 80-89 (1), 180-189 (2), 280-289 (3), 380-389 (4), and 480-488 (5). So, 5 sets. Each set contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last set, which is only 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, for the first four sets, each contributes 10 eights, and the last set contributes 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10th number, resulting in 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is every 10th number, resulting in 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and 480-488 contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as there are no pages 800-899.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me count how many sets of ten there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. From 200-299: 240-249 is another 10. From 300-399: 340-349 is another 10. From 400-488: 440-449 is another 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, how many sets do we have? From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is 10. From 200-299: 280-289 is 10. From 300-399: 380-389 is 10. From 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " Let me count each block. Each block of 100 numbers has a 4 in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). So, from 1 to 488, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 1-99: 40-49 is one block, so 10 fours. 100-199: 140-149, another 10 fours. 200-299: 240-249, another 10 fours. 300-399: 340-349, another 10 fours. 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, total tens place fours would be 10 * 5 = 50? Wait, no, because 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 fours, but does 440-449 count as part of 400-488? Yes, because 440 is within 400-488. So, 5 blocks each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, 400-488 is actually 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers, but in 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, 440-449 is the only block where the tens digit is 4, so that's 10 fours. So, total tens place fours: 10 (from 40-49) + 10 (140-149) + 10 (240-249) + 10 (340-349) +10 (440-449) = 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Wait, but each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, does 488 count? Yes, because 488 is a valid page. So, how many such numbers? Let me see: the first is 8, the last is 488. So, the number of 8's in the units place is how many? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, but 8,18,...,488. Let me check: 8 is the first, then every 10 numbers. So, the number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range. So, how many blocks? Let's see: 80-89: 10 eights. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: here, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, 480 has 8 in the tens place, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers (from 480 to 488 inclusive). So, the tens place eights: 10 (80-89) +10 (180-189)+10 (280-289)+10 (380-389)+9 (480-488) = 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Therefore, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me make sure I didn't count any extra numbers. For example, in the tens place for fours, I counted 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 fours, totaling 50. But wait, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That seems correct. For the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. For the units place, 49 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights, units place: 49, tens place: 49, so total 98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So that's 5 blocks of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. Let's see, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many that is. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences.

Wait, let me check each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: here, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that's 9 numbers instead of 10. So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours than eights there are: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts, especially in the tens and units places. For fours: units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, how many steps of 10? (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each with 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89. Total fours: 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So that's 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, total eights: 49+49=98. Therefore, 188-98=90.

    "text": " Let me count how many sets of 100 there are. From 1-488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, in each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. How many hundreds are there? Well, 488 is less than 500, so we have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times each. That's 4*10=40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), how many times does the tens digit 4 occur? The tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in pages 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit 4 occurs 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units: 49, that's correct because from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place, and 488/10 = 48.8, which rounds up to 49. Tens: 50, as each hundred contributes 10, and the last partial hundred contributes another 10, so 50. Hundreds: 89, since 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. How many sets of 100 are there? Up to 488, so 4 complete hundreds. Each contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 4*10=40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), does the tens digit 8 occur? Yes, in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 9 numbers: 480-488. So, that's 9 more. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never is 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (including the partial block 440-449).\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in page numbers 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 4 full blocks.

    "text": " Let me count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, and each set contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, from 40-49: 10 fours. Then 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. That's 5 sets, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 5 sets, 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 = 88, so plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the fours in units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, meaning 48 eights, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488. So, that's 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit can be 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place being 8. Each set like 80-89 has 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count how many such sets there are. From 80-89: 10 eights. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: since 488 is the last page, this set has 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 +1 = 9). Wait, no: 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, so that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So that's 4*10 +9 = 40 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the Number of 4's:**\n1. **Units Place (1s):** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens Place (10s):** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds Place (100s):** 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the Number of 8's:**\n1. **Units Place (1s):** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

Each of the first four sets contributes 10, and the last set contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds Place (100s):** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Similarly, 140-149: another 10, so 20 so far. 240-249: another 10, so 30. 340-349: another 10, so 40. Then, 440-449: another 10, so 50. So, in the tens place, there are 50 fours. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, there are 89 fours. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights. 180-189: another 10, so 20. 280-289: another 10, so 30. 380-389: another 10, so 40. Now, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, we have 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, total in tens place: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the question is how many more fours than eights. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake. Let me recount the fours: units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. That seems right. Eights: units: 49, tens: 49. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " Let me count how many sets of 100 there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. Similarly, 240-249 is 10, 340-349 is 10, and 440-449 is another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these numbers contributes one 4. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, 480-489 would be another set, but since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Wait, let me check: From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is 10. From 200-299: 280-289 is 10. From 300-399: 380-389 is 10. From 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place, each of the first four sets gives 10 eights, and the last set gives 9. So total is 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract 98 from 188: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. Difference is 90. Hmm, but wait, did I count correctly in the tens place for fours? Let me check again. For fours in the tens place, the sets are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. Correct. For eights in the tens place, the sets are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, that's five sets, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. That seems right.

So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, 8's appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. The last one is 488. So, how many numbers? Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms can be calculated by (488 - 8)/10 + 1. That's (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many sets there are. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the first four sets have 10 each, and the last set has 9. So, total in tens place is 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. Total 188. For the 8's: units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. Total 98. 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set has 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 numbers.\n- Total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four sets have 10 each, and the last set has 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n- Total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me count how many sets of ten there are where the tens digit is 4. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these numbers contributes a 4. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me check: 400 to 488 inclusive is indeed 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, the last occurrence is at 488. To find how many, I can calculate 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the 49th number? Let me see: starting from 8, the numbers are 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let me count how many sets: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). So, total tens place eights: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 =49. Wait, but wait: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98 eights. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place count. For the tens place, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. That's 10+10+10+10+9=49, which seems correct. So, total eights are 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me check again because I might have made a mistake in counting. Let me go through the fours again to make sure. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many numbers? From 4 to 484 with step 10. The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, ((484 -4)/10)+1=(480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10,140-149:10,240-249:10,340-349:10,440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488:89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. Total fours:49+50+89=188. Correct. For eights: units place:8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10. ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89:10,180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. Total 49. Hundreds place: none, so 0. Total eights:49+49=98. So, difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place (ones place):** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of fours is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is.

So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one which is only 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 +1 =9). Wait, so the first four sets are full 10 numbers, and the last set is 9. So, total eights in tens place would be 4\u00d710 +9=49. Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49.

So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of eights is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) -98 (eights)=90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, how many terms? (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

So, for the first four blocks, it's 4 * 10 = 40, plus 9 for the last partial block. So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98.

    "text": " Let me count each set. - 40-49: that's 10 numbers, so 10 fours in the tens place. - 140-149: another 10 fours. - 240-249: another 10 fours. - 340-349: another 10 fours. - 440-449: another 10 fours. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, there are 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last occurrence is 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but including 488, that would be 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see, 480-489 would be the next set, but since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Wait, so how many full sets do we have? - 80-89: 10 eights. - 180-189: 10 eights. - 280-289: 10 eights. - 380-389: 10 eights. - 480-488: Here, the tens digit is 8, so numbers 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, for the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 (40 eights) and one set of 9, totaling 49 eights. Wait, but is that correct? Let me think again. Each full set (like 80-89) contributes 10 eights in the tens place. There are 4 full sets (80s, 180s, 280s, 380s), so that's 4*10=40 eights. Then, the last partial set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " Let me count each block. Each block of 100 numbers has a 4 in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers. So, from 0-99: 40-49, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The last occurrence is at 488. So, from 8 to 488 with a step of 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, right? Because 488 is the last page. So, let me count each block: From 0-99: 80-89, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. Difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Yeah, that seems right. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (from 4 to 484, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89 (from 400 to 488 inclusive).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (from 8 to 488, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9 (since 488 is the limit).\n   - Total: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (as the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me count how many such sets there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one set of 10 numbers. Then, 100-199: 140-149 is another set. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, and 300-399: 340-349. Then, 400-488: 440-449. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, but does 488 count as the 49th? Yes, because 488 ends with an 8. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would be another set, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, let's count the sets: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units place was 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for fours. Let me recount that. For fours in the tens place, it's 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. That's correct. And in the units place, from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers, which is 49 times. And hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 188 fours. For eights, units place from 8 to 488, which is 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4\u00d710 +9=49. So, total eights: 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.

The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me think: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because starting from 0, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many sets there are.

So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488, which is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

    "text": " Let me count how many sets of ten there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149: another 10, and so on. How many such sets are there?

So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up the fours in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but wait, 488 is included, so the last one is 488. So, starting at 8, every 10 numbers up to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 380-389 is included, but 480-489 would be up to 488. So, let's list them: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes how many eights? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so the tens digit is 8 for all these, so that's 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, is that right? Let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10\u00d74 +9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98.

Yes, because 488 is beyond that, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89.

Let me see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? The first is 8, which is the 1st, then 18 is the 2nd, and so on. The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 8. Wait, no. Let me think again. The number of times 8 appears in the units place is equal to the number of times 8 is the last digit. So, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? It's the floor of (488 / 10) which is 48, but since 488 ends with 8, we add 1, making it 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, let me count each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 489 is beyond 488). So, total in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights in total. Wait, but wait a second, when I counted the units place, I thought it was 49, and the tens place was 49, so total 98 eights. But let me double-check the units place because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake there. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's the same as the number of complete decades plus any extra. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8, and then in the 49th decade (481-490), we have 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, yes, 49 eights in the units place. Similarly, in the tens place, as calculated, 49 eights. So total eights: 98. Now, the number of fours was 188, and the number of eights was 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the fours first. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The nth term is 10n - 6, but maybe it's easier to think of it as starting at 4 and ending at 484, step 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488. How many numbers? 488 - 400 +1=89. So, 89 fours in hundreds place. Total fours: 49 +50 +89=188. That's correct. Now, eights: units place: 8,18,28,...,488. Number of terms: ((488 -8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in units place. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Hundreds place: none, as 800-899 is beyond 488. So, total eights: 49 +49=98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 sets.\n   - Total: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each set (except the last) contributes 10 numbers.\n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets, each with 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in the numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to fours, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. Let me count each set: 80-89: 10 eights in tens place. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits with 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188.

But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours from each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that: 49 + 50 = 99, and 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's see: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let me count the number of sets. The first set is 80-89 (10 numbers), then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set has only 9 numbers (480-488). So, for the first four sets, each contributes 10 eights in the tens place, and the last set contributes 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 from the last set, totaling 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights from each place: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, I subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but 488 is included, right? So yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of fours is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's.

Let me see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, every 10 numbers adds another 8. So, 8, 18, ..., 488. That's 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many sets there are. The first set is 80-89 (10 numbers), then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So that's 5 sets, but the last set is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, each of the first four sets contributes 10 eights in the tens place, and the last set contributes 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me double-check. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 10 eights. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9. So yes, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of eights is 98. Now, the question is how many more fours than eights. So, fours are 188, eights are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems a big difference. Let me check the counts again. Maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let's go through each digit place again for both fours and eights. **Counting Fours Again:**\n- **Units place:** From 4, 14, 24,...,484. How many terms? The sequence is 4 + 10k where k=0 to n. The last term is 484. So, 4 +10k=484 \u219210k=480\u2192k=48. So, k=0 to 48, which is 49 terms. Correct.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set is 10 numbers. How many sets? From 40-49 (1 set), then each hundred has another set. So, 400-488 includes 440-449. So, 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. 5*10=50. Correct.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488. That's 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). Each has a 4 in hundreds place. So, 89 fours. Correct.\n\nTotal fours: 49+50+89=188. That seems right.\n\n**Counting Eights Again:**\n- **Units place:** 8,18,28,...,488. The sequence is 8 +10k where k=0 to n. The last term is 488. So, 8+10k=488\u219210k=480\u2192k=48. So, k=0 to 48, which is 49 terms. Correct.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each set except the last has 10 numbers. So, 4 sets with 10 eights each, and the last set (480-488) has 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n- **Hundreds place:** No eights here since the book ends at 488. So, 0. Correct.\n\nTotal eights: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Let me count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers. From 0-99, there's one set (40-49). Then 100-199, another set (140-149). 200-299, another set (240-249). 300-399, another set (340-349). 400-488, another set (440-449). So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll go through each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. To find the count, I can do (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the tens digit being 8, right? Because 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, each set of 100 numbers has one set of 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except maybe the last set. Let's see: From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set has 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each set has 10 numbers except the last, which has 9. Total = 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me count how many sets there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, and so on. How many such sets are there? The hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. But 0 in the hundreds place would mean single-digit numbers, but 4 in the tens place would require the hundreds digit to be 0, which isn't possible because page numbers don't have leading zeros. So, the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. So, four sets: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, that's five sets because starting from 40-49 (hundreds digit 0, but page numbers don't have leading zeros, so maybe it's considered as part of the two-digit numbers). Let me think again. For two-digit numbers, 40-49: 10 numbers. For three-digit numbers, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's four more sets, each with 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 10 (from 40-49) + 4*10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, we're only considering the hundreds digit being 4, so each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is valid, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let me count how many sets there are. For two-digit numbers: 80-89: 10 numbers. For three-digit numbers: 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these is 10 numbers. So, that's 3 more sets, each with 10 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 10 (from 80-89) + 3*10 = 40. Wait, but 380-389 is within 488, so that's valid. So, 40 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4, but 8 in the hundreds place would require the number to be 800-899, which is beyond 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (40) = 89. Wait, that seems low. Let me check again. Units place: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? From 8 to 488, step 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place: 49. Tens place: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. That's 4 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 40. So, total eights: 49 + 40 = 89. So, number of fours: 188, number of eights: 89. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 89 = 99. Wait, but let me double-check the counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake with inclusive counts. Let me recount the fours in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. For the tens place, 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's five sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours in the tens place. Units place: 4,14,...,484. 484 is 48*10 +4, so 48+1=49 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights, units place: 8,18,...,488. 49 eights. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389. That's four sets, each with 10 numbers, so 40 eights. So, 49+40=89. So, 188-89=99. Therefore, there are 99 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in the tens place in sets like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.  \n   Total occurrences: 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488.  \n   Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in the tens place in sets like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, and 380-389.  \n   Total occurrences: 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   8 does not appear in the hundreds place since page numbers go up to 488.  \n   Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **89**.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (number of 4's) - 89 (number of 8's) = **99**.\n\n\\boxed{99}"

    "text": " Let me count how many sets of ten there are where the tens digit is 4. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. And 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go beyond 488? 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Every 10 numbers, so total is floor(488/10) + 1 if the last number is 484, which is 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct. Tens place: for each hundred, there's a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). 100-199: 140-149 (10). 200-299: 240-249 (10). 300-399: 340-349 (10). 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, 400-488: 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10. So, 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. That's correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 occurrences because 488 is included. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 set, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. So, how many sets? From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, for the tens place: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, etc.) and one set of 9. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because 188 - 98 is 90, but I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. Eights: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set. From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is another 10. From 200-299: 280-289 is another 10. From 300-399: 380-389 is another 10. From 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, adding up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no hundreds digits of 8 in this book. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights, I subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " Let me check. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10).

So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, it's included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-489, but wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 numbers instead of 10. So, for the hundreds place, 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (from 1-399) plus 9 in 400-488. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the fours and eights in each place. For fours: units: 4,14,...,484. That's (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, 5 sets, so 50. Correct. Hundreds: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-488. So, 4 sets of 10 (1-399) and 1 set of 9 (400-488). So, 4\u00d710=40 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds: 0. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for fours was 89, but maybe I should check if 488 is included correctly. 400-488 is 89 numbers because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. Yes, correct. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four sets contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40, and the last set contributes 9.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No pages from 800-899 exist in a 488-page book.\n   - Occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, and each set contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, from 40-49: 10 fours, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but I'm only considering the hundreds place, so each number contributes one 4 in the hundreds digit. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4, and then in the 480-488 range, the units place 4 is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 fours in the units place. Tens place: as I thought, 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 fours, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, and then 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8. So, how many sets? 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 eights (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, but in the tens place, each number in 480-488 has an 8 in the tens place, right? Because 480 is 4-8-0, so tens digit is 8, same with 481, etc., up to 488. So, that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 80-89 is 10 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the tens place, same for 180-189, etc. So, 4 sets of 10, which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 40 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Wait, but let me check again. Units place: 49 eights, tens place: 49 eights, so total 98 eights. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484) \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 5 sets of 10 \u2192 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488) \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with an additional 9 from 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place \u2192 0 times.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.

Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488).

So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are there than 8's.

So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, and then the next set would be 540-549, which is beyond 488. So, yes, only 5 sets. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these numbers contributes a 4. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but I think I might be overcomplicating. Actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.

So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's.

So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but we need to check if 488 is included. Yes, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, every 10 numbers, so 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let's check each set. - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights. - 180-189: another 10 eights. - 280-289: another 10 eights. - 380-389: another 10 eights. - 480-488: how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, that's 9 eights. So total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the tens place for eights again. When I counted the tens place for eights, I had 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 10 (80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 49. That seems right. For fours, in the tens place, I had 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. And in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Units place for fours: 4,14,...,484. Let me check how many that is. From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The formula is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, that's correct. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Eights: 49 units + 49 tens = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first thought about it, I thought the difference might be smaller. Let me see if I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, that's correct. So, I think my calculation is right.

Because 450-488 would have a tens digit of 5, 6, 7, 8. So, in the last set, 400-449, the tens digit is 4 for 50 numbers (40-49 in each hundred). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let me calculate:\n\n- 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 400-449: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers (since 440-449 is within 400-488)\n\nWait, so that's 5 sets each contributing 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so that's 89 fours.\n\nNow, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours are 188.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number is 488, which is in the units place. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers, but wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. That's 49 numbers because from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, gives 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, 480-488 is included. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\n- 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488)\n\nSo, adding up: 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. So, yes, 9 eights in the tens place for the last set.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nNow, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98 eights.\n\nWait, but wait a minute, let me double-check the tens place for 480-488. Are there 9 numbers? 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. Yes, that's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place for that set.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, for fours, I had 188 fours. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check again because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, for fours:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49+49=98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90 more fours.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems right.\n\nAnd for the tens place, in the hundreds, like 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, right? So, 10 fours in the tens place for that set.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 400-488 includes 400-449 as the tens digit 4, which is 50 numbers (from 40-49 in each hundred). Wait, no, in the hundreds place, when we're considering the tens digit, for 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 fours in the tens place for that set. So, in total, 5 sets (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488) each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, except the last set only contributes 10 if we're considering 440-449. Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in the tens place, we have 4 sets contributing 10 each (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399), and the last set (400-488) contributing 9 eights in the tens place (480-488). So, 4\u00d710 +9=49 eights in the tens place.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nSo, 188 fours -98 eights=90.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When counting the units place for fours, I considered 4,14,24,...,484, which is 49 numbers. Similarly, for eights, 8,18,28,...,488, which is also 49 numbers. So, both units places have 49 occurrences.\n\nIn the tens place, fours have 50, eights have 49.\n\nIn the hundreds place, fours have 89, eights have 0.\n\nSo, total fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal eights:49+49+0=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if 488 is included in the units place for eights. Yes, 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for fours, 484 is the last number with a 4 in the units place, which is included.\n\nSo, I think the calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of fours printed is 90 more than the number of eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, and the number of sets depends on how many hundreds are there. From 0-488, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, in the tens place, 4 can appear in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, 449 is less than 488, so yes, that's valid. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's see: Each set is 10 numbers, so 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

From 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but in the 400-488 range, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.

Let me count each set: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last, so 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers). So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

So, 188 fours in total. Now, I need to count the number of 8's. Let's do the same approach for 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, which would give 48 eights. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488. So, that's 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers). So, how many eights in the tens place? 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, that's 4 x 10 = 40 plus 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

    "text": " Let me count how many sets there are. Each set has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. The first set is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but does 400 count? Yes, because it's the first number in that range. So, total fours in hundreds place: 89. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is included. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence. Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Each set except the last one has 10 numbers, but the last set has 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Let me count: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9. So, total eights in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place for fours, I had 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. For the tens place, I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours. Units place was 49 fours, so total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor the eights: units place was 49, tens place was 49, so total eights: 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for eights again. I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, which is 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for fours in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place for fours again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first occurrence is at 4, then every 10 numbers. So, the last occurrence is at 484, which is 484. So, how many numbers is that? Let me calculate: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 fours in units place. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in units place, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The last occurrence is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in units place. Correct.\n\nSo, the calculation seems correct, and the difference is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, and each set contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, from 40-49: 10 numbers, 10 fours. Then 140-149: another 10 fours. Similarly, 240-249: 10 fours. 340-349: 10 fours. 440-449: 10 fours. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first is 4, then every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is the last page, 484 is included, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 fours in units. Tens place: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, so 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each with a 4 in hundreds place. So, 89 fours. Total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? The last number is 488, which is the 49th multiple of 10 after 0, but let's check. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the last 8 in the units place is at 488. So, starting at 8 (which is the 1st), 18 (2nd), ..., 488 (49th). So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range. Let me count how many sets there are. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, each of the first four sets contributes 10 eights in the tens place, and the last set contributes 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 x 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 4 x 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check again. Units place: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in units. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 4x10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in tens. Hundreds place: 0. So, total eights: 49 +49=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms (since 484 = 4 + (48-1)*10).\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set contributes 10 fours, totaling 5*10=50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 numbers here.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four sets contribute 4*10=40, and 480-488 contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** None, as the book doesn't reach 800.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me count each block. Each block is 100 numbers, and within each block, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 1-400, how many blocks are there? Let's see: 40-49 is in 1-100, 140-149 in 100-200, 240-249 in 200-300, 340-349 in 300-400, and 440-449 in 400-500. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4.

Let's count each block. Each block is 100 numbers, with 10 numbers having 8 in the tens place. So, from 1-400, how many blocks? 80-89 is in 1-100, 180-189 in 100-200, 280-289 in 200-300, 380-389 in 300-400, and 480-488 in 400-500. So, that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 eights, except the last one, which is only 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9. So, total in tens place: (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.
