Let's see: For 4's, hundreds place is 89, which is correct because from 400 to 488 is 89 numbers. Tens place: 5 sets, each 10, so 50. Units:49. So, 89+50=139, plus 49 is 188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, so 98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the units place for every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - The sequence starts at 4 and ends at 484.  \n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.  \n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences.  \n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.  \n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the units place for every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - The sequence starts at 8 and ends at 488.  \n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.  \n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block which contributes 9 (since the book ends at 488).  \n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 0 \\).\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference between the number of 4's and 8's:**  \n\\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"
