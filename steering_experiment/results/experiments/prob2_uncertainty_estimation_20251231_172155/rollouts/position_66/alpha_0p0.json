So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly? Let me take a small example to verify. Suppose we have a book with page numbers up to 20. How many 4's and 8's would there be? Page numbers:1-20. 4's:4,14 => 2 fours. 8's:8,18 =>2 eights. So, 2-2=0. So, in this case, the difference is 0.

Tens:40-49: no, 80-89 not in 1-50, so only 80-89 if page numbers go up to 89. Wait, in 1-50, tens place for 8 is only 40-49? No, wait, 80-89 is beyond 50, so in 1-50, the tens digit 8 only appears in 80-89, which isn't in 1-50. So, in 1-50, tens place 8's:0. So, 8's:5. So, 4's:15, 8's:5. Difference:10.

Wait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that I'm overcounting somewhere? For example, in the hundreds place, 488 is included in both the hundreds and tens place? Wait, no, because in the hundreds place, we're only counting 400-488, which includes 488, but in the tens place, when we count 480-488, that's part of the tens digit being 8. Wait, but 488 has an 8 in the tens place and an 8 in the units place. So, each occurrence is counted separately. So, in the tens place, 480-488 includes 488, which is counted once for the tens 8.

Hmm, that's a difference of 90. But wait, let me think again. Did I count correctly? Let me take a smaller example to check. Suppose the book has 100 pages. How many 4's and 8's would there be? Let's compute. 4's: units: 4,14,24,34,44: 10 times. Tens: 40-49:10 times. Hundreds: none. So, total 20. 8's: units:8,18,28,38,48: 10 times. Tens:80-89:10 times. Hundreds: none. So, total 20. Difference: 0. Now, in 100 pages, the difference is 0. But in 488, it's 90. That seems a bit high, but let me see. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct. So, 188 fours and 98 eights, so 90 more fours. Hmm, okay, maybe that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about it another way. For each digit position, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear. Let me try that.\n\nFor units digit (ones place):\n\n- For 488 pages, the number of times each digit appears in the units place is as follows. Each digit from 0-9 appears equally, except possibly the last digit if 488 is not a multiple of 10.\n\nWait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the units digit cycles 48 full times, and then 8 more numbers (481-488). So, for each digit, the count is 48 times for digits 0-9, plus one more for the digits that appear in the remaining 8 numbers. The remaining numbers are 481-488, so units digits are 1-8. So, digits 1-8 each get an extra count, and 9 and 0 do not. So, for units digit:\n\n- Number of 4's: 48 +1 (since 4 is in the remaining 8 numbers) =49.\n- Number of 8's:48 +1=49.\n\nWait, that's different from what I had before. Wait, but earlier I thought units digit for 4's was 49, which matches, but for 8's, units digit is also 49. But earlier, I thought the units digit for 8's was 49. So that's consistent.\n\nFor tens digit:\n\nEach digit from 0-9 appears 48 times in the tens place for 488 numbers. Wait, no, actually, for the tens digit, each digit appears 10 times for each hundred. So, in 488 pages, there are 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 88 more pages (400-488). So, for the tens digit:\n\n- In each hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 4*10=40 times for each digit.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (400-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear? From 400-409: tens digit 0, 10 times. 410-419: tens digit 1, 10 times. ... up to 480-488: tens digit 8, 9 times (since 488 is the last page). So, for tens digit:\n\n- Digits 0-7: each appears 10 times in the 400-488 range.\n- Digit 8: appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total for each digit in the tens place:\n\n- Digits 0-7: 40 (from hundreds) +10=50\n- Digit 8:40 +9=49\n- Digit 9:40 (since 488 doesn't reach 490, so digit 9 in tens place doesn't appear in the last partial hundred).\n\nWait, but wait, 400-488 includes 480-488, which is tens digit 8, 9 times. So, digit 8 in tens place: 40 (from the 4 hundreds) +9=49.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 4 in tens place: it's in 400-409, which is 10 times, so 40+10=50.\n\nSo, for 4's in tens place:50, and for 8's:49.\n\nNow, for hundreds digit:\n\n- The hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for 400-488, which is 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). So, 89 fours.\n\nDigit 8 in hundreds place: never, since 800-899 isn't included. So, 0.\n\nSo, total 4's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought about the tens digit, I had 49 eights, which matches this calculation. So, yes, the difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit from the right):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

Correct. - Tens:80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. - Hundreds: none. So, 49+49=98. Thus, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting in different digit positions, overlaps might occur, but in this case, since we're counting each digit position separately, I think it's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. Let me try to calculate the number of 4's and 8's again using a different approach to verify. For the 4's: Each digit position can be considered independently. In the units place, for every 10 numbers, there's one 4. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4, so 48. But wait, in the units place, from 1 to 488, the first 4 is at 4, so the count is actually floor((488 +1)/10) = floor(489/10)=48. But wait, that would give 48, but earlier I had 49. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there. Let me think. The number of times a digit appears in the units place up to N is floor((N +1)/10). So for N=488, it's floor(489/10)=48. So, that would mean 48 fours in the units place. But earlier I thought it was 49. Wait, that's conflicting. Let me check with a smaller number. For example, up to 40: page numbers 1-40. How many 4's in the units place? 4,14,24,34,44. That's 5 numbers. Using the formula, floor((40 +1)/10)=floor(41/10)=4, which is incorrect because there are 5 fours. Hmm, so maybe the formula is different. Alternatively, maybe it's better to calculate it as (N // 10) + (1 if the units digit >= the target digit else 0). Wait, maybe that's more accurate. Let me try that. For units digit 4: The number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to N is (N // 10) + (1 if N % 10 >=4 else 0). So for N=488: 488//10=48, and 488%10=8, which is >=4, so 48+1=49. That matches my initial count. So, units place:49 fours. Similarly, for the tens place: The number of times 4 appears in the tens place is calculated as follows. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9. So, for each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). So, up to 488, how many complete hundreds do we have? 488 is in the 400-499 range. So, from 0-488, we have 4 complete hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 400-488. Each complete hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, in the incomplete hundred (400-488), how many numbers have 4 in the tens place? That's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours:40+10=50. That matches my initial count. For the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, as calculated before. So, 89 fours. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Now, for the 8's: Units place: Using the same method as for 4's, the number of 8's in the units place up to N is (N //10) + (1 if N %10 >=8 else 0). So, N=488: 488//10=48, 488%10=8, which is >=8, so 48+1=49. Tens place: The number of times 8 appears in the tens place. Each hundred contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). Up to 488, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399). Each contributes 10, so 4*10=40. Now, in the incomplete hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total tens place eights:40+9=49. Hundreds place: As before, no numbers have 8 in the hundreds place up to 488, so 0. So, total eights:49+49+0=98. Therefore, the difference is 188-98=90. So, I think my initial calculation was correct. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488 + 1}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total 4's:**\n\\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488 + 1}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each complete block contributes 10 occurrences, with the last block contributing 9.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:**\n\\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**\n\\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"
