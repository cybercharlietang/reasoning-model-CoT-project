For the 8's: - Units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is 8 + 48*10, so 49 numbers. Correct. - Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. Wait, in the hundreds place for 4's, I counted 400-488 as 89 numbers. But 488 is included, so 488-400+1=89. That's correct. For the tens place in 8's, I counted 480-488 as 9 numbers because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, right? Wait, no. 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers, correct. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place for that set. So, total eights in tens place: 49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.

Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, but wait, let me think again. When counting the hundreds place for 4's, I included 400-488, which is correct. But for 8's, the hundreds place doesn't contribute anything. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as each digit position separately and ensure I didn't miss anything. Another way to approach this is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor the units place:\n- For 4's: 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing 1 four, so 48, plus the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), which include another four at 484. So, 48+1=49. Correct.\n- For 8's: Similarly, 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full cycles, each with one 8, so 48, plus the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 488, which is another 8. So, 48+1=49. Correct.\n\nFor the tens place:\n- For 4's: Each hundred has a block where the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers. There are 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, actually, 0-99: 40-49 (10)\n100-199:140-149 (10)\n200-299:240-249 (10)\n300-399:340-349 (10)\n400-488:440-449 (10)\nSo, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place:\n- 0-99:80-89 (10)\n100-199:180-189 (10)\n200-299:280-289 (10)\n300-399:380-389 (10)\n400-488:480-488 (9)\nTotal:10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n- 4's:400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n- 8's: No numbers in the hundreds place, since the book ends at 488. So, 0.\n\nAdding up, 4's:49+50+89=188\n8's:49+49=98\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. I think I did it right.

Now, the 8's: - Units place: 8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, plus 1 is 49. Correct. - Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. When I was counting the tens place for 4's, I considered 440-449 as part of the tens place. But in reality, 440-449 is in the hundreds place, but the tens digit is also 4. So, each of those numbers has both a hundreds digit 4 and a tens digit 4. So, when I counted the tens place, I included those 10 numbers, which is correct because each of those has a 4 in the tens place. Similarly, in the hundreds place, I counted all 400-488, which includes those 440-449 numbers, but that's okay because each digit is counted separately. So, the total 4's are correctly 188. Similarly, for 8's, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, I think my calculation is accurate.
