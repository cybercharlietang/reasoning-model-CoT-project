    "text": " Wait, no, actually, 484 is the 49th occurrence because 484 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 4. Wait, maybe I should think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488 is equal to the number of complete groups of 10, which is 48 full groups (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8), plus any extra numbers beyond that. Each group contributes one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, in the last partial group, from 480 to 488, the units digits go from 0 to 8, so 484 is included, which is the 49th occurrence. So, actually, it's 49 times in the units place. Wait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, and then we check if the units digit beyond that includes a 4. The units digit beyond 480 is 0 to 8, so 484 is included, so that's one more, making it 49. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, for the tens place, 4 can appear as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, and so on. How many such ranges are there up to 488? Let's see: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but does 440-449 go beyond 488? 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's 50 times. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4, which would be from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, in the last partial group, from 480-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which is another 8. So, total units place: 48 +1=49 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8 can appear in the tens place as 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers except the last one, which has 9 numbers (480-488). Let's count how many full ranges there are. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 4 full ranges of 10 and one range of 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=40+9=49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=49+49=98. So, total 8's:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check the tens place for 8's again. The ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last range, 480-488, is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 40+9=49. That's correct. Similarly, for 4's in the tens place, we have 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, and 440-449 is within 488, so 5*10=50. Correct. For hundreds place, 4's are from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. So, the total 4's are 188, 8's are 98, difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " So, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, which suggests 48 full cycles and then 4 more, making it 49. Hmm, maybe I was too quick to take the integer part. Let me think again. The number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488 is equal to the number of times 4 appears in each set of 10 numbers. For example, in 1-10, it's once (at 4), in 11-20, once (at 14), and so on. So, for 488 pages, how many full decades are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full decades and a partial decade of 8 numbers (481-488). In each full decade, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the partial decade, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 4 appear here? Yes, at 484. So that's one more. So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. This happens in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are up to 488. The blocks are 40-49 (40-49), 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So that's 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me compute that: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, I need to count the number of 8's in the same way. Let's do the same process for 8's. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many times this happens. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full decades and a partial decade of 8 numbers (481-488). In each full decade, one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. In the partial decade, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once at 488. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such blocks are there up to 488. The blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each contributes 10 numbers. So that's 4 blocks, each with 10, so 4 * 10 = 40. Wait, is there a 480-489 block? But 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is part of the hundreds place. However, the tens digit in 480-488 is 8 for 480-488, but only up to 488. So, in the tens place, 8 appears in 480-488 as well. Wait, I think I missed that. So, in addition to the four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), there's also 480-488, where the tens digit is 8. So, how many numbers is that? From 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4 blocks * 10 = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. Wait, but 480-488 is actually part of the hundreds place, but the tens digit is 8. So, yes, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers here. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 8's in hundreds place: 0. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Total blocks: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., and in 480-488.\n   - Total blocks: 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 40, plus 9 from 480-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place gives 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? Since the book goes up to 488, the last block is 440-449. So, there are 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Next, I'll count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. To find how many, divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part gives 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers (from 8 to 488, stepping by 10). So, units place gives 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100. The blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. However, since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's check each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights. - 180-189: 10 eights. - 280-289: 10 eights. - 380-389: 10 eights. - 480-488: 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98 eights. Now, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** None (since the book ends at 488).\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, I think I should add 1 to 48, making it 49. Wait, but 484 is 48*10 + 4, so maybe it's 49 times? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place from 1 to N can be calculated by (N // 10) + 1 if the units digit is >= the target digit. Wait, no, actually, for each full set of 10 numbers, the digit appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full tens. Each contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48. Then, in the 488th page, the units digit is 8, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, total 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, from 1 to 488, the number of 4's in the units place is 49. Okay, I think that's correct.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are up to 488. The ranges are:\n   - 40-49: 10 numbers\n   - 140-149: 10 numbers\n   - 240-249: 10 numbers\n   - 340-349: 10 numbers\n   - 440-449: 10 numbers\n   Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times.\n\nNow, adding up the 4's in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99; 99+89=188. So, total 188 4's.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48. But the last page is 488, which ends with an 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see how many such ranges are within 488:\n   - 80-89: 10 numbers\n   - 180-189: 10 numbers\n   - 280-289: 10 numbers\n   - 380-389: 10 numbers\n   The next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, we only have 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, that's 9 numbers instead of 10. So, total tens place 8's: 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9, totaling 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only has 488 pages, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nNow, subtracting the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49+50=99; 99+89=188.

But wait, did I count correctly in the tens place for 8's? Let me check again. The ranges for tens place 8's are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So that's 5 ranges, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, 4 full ranges of 10 and 1 partial range of 9, which is 4*10 +9=49. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, we had 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 ranges, 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4's are from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is accurate, and the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.

Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-488, there are 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so that's 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449? Since the book has 488 pages, 449 is within the range, so yes, that's a valid block. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 occurrences (since 488 is included). So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Each full block (like 80-89) has 10 numbers, but the last block (480-488) has only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, how many full blocks are there? 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, the last block (480-488) contributes 9 numbers. So, total tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the number 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   Number of occurrences = (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.  \n   Number of occurrences = 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in 400-488.  \n   Number of occurrences = 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nTotal number of 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   Number of occurrences = (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.  \n   Number of occurrences = 4 blocks \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   Number of occurrences = 0.\n\nTotal number of 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n\nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, no, actually, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each group of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then an additional 4 in 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place gives 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let's see how many such ranges there are. Starting from 40-49: that's one range. Then 140-149: that's another. Continuing this way, the next would be 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many ranges is that? From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449: that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is only up to 449, and the book goes up to 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 49 fours. Tens place: 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50. Hundreds place: 89. So total 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. Let's count how many. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. Each of these ranges contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's see how many ranges there are. 80-89: 1 range, 180-189: another, 280-289: another, 380-389: another, and 480-488: which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but I'm counting the tens place. So, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, so that's 9 numbers. Wait, but each range before that (like 80-89) has 10 numbers, so 10 eights in the tens place. So, for 80-89: 10 eights. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 eights (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, but actually, from 480 to 489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, the number of eights would be 4 ranges of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) and one range of 9 (480-488). So, total eights in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10 eights. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, but let me make sure. Units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 49 eights. So total 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the 4's: Units place: 49 fours. Tens place: 5 ranges \u00d710=50. Hundreds place: 89 fours. So, 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For the 8's: Units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 49 eights. So, 98 eights. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 fours (appearing in 4, 14, ..., 484).\n   - **Tens place:** 50 fours (in ranges 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n   - **Hundreds place:** 89 fours (pages 400-488).\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 eights (appearing in 8, 18, ..., 488).\n   - **Tens place:** 49 eights (in ranges 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n   - **Hundreds place:** 0 eights (since page numbers don't reach 800).\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. But wait, 440-449 is only up to 449, which is within 488, so that's fine.

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 4's appear 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488.

Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, 49 times. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's see: Each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the hundreds place, the 400-488 block contributes only 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (from 0-399) plus 9 in 400-488. So, 4\u00d710=40 +9=49. So, tens place: 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49+0=98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) -98 (number of 8's)=90.

    "text": " So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 484 is within 488, we have 49 occurrences in the units place. Wait, maybe I should calculate it as (488 + 1) / 10, but that might not be accurate. Alternatively, I can think of it as the number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. The formula is usually floor((n + 10 - d) / 10), where d is the digit. So, for 4 in units place: floor((488 + 10 - 4)/10) = floor(494/10) = 49.4, which floors to 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, for the tens place, 4 appears in the tens digit every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within that range, but 540-549 would be beyond. Let me count how many sets of 100 there are. From 1-488, there are four full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. In each hundred, the 4 in the tens place occurs 10 times (e.g., 40-49). So, from 1-400, there are 4 sets, each contributing 10 occurrences, so 4*10=40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 occurrences. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 more. So total in tens place is 40 + 10 = 50. But wait, from 1-400, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let me think again. From 1-100: 40-49, which is 10 times. 101-200: 140-149, another 10. 201-300: 240-249, another 10. 301-400: 340-349, another 10. So that's 4*10=40. Then from 401-488: 440-449, which is another 10. So total is 40+10=50. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. How many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. I'll go through each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the count is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Alternatively, using the formula: floor((488 +10 -8)/10)=floor(490/10)=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens digit every 100 numbers, like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of it. So, each hundred contributes 10 occurrences. Let's count: From 1-400, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. So that's 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have 40 +9=49. Wait, but let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 occurrences. So total in tens place is 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0. Adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's), which is 90.

    "text": " So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 484 is within the range, it's actually 49 times. Wait, maybe I should think of it as (488 // 10) + 1 if 484 is included. Hmm, maybe a better approach is to calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place. Since the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, the number of 4's in the units place is the total number of pages divided by 10, which is 488 / 10 = 48.8. Taking the integer part gives 48, but since 484 is within the range, it's actually 49 times. Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, so the last units digit 4 is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which is the second digit from the right. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. The first range is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, 440-449 is only 10 numbers, right? So yes, 5 ranges, 50 times. So tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place as well. Since the book has up to 488 pages, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, we're only looking for when the hundreds digit is 4, so every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 numbers. So hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times. So units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8's in the tens place occur in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such ranges there are. The first is 80-89 (10 numbers), then 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). Wait, 480-489 would be another, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. So, let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So total tens place 8's: 4 ranges with 10 each and one range with 9. So 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but wait: 80-89 is one range, 180-189 is another, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 ranges. The first four have 10 each, and the last one has 9. So total is 4*10 +9=49. So tens place:49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So hundreds place:0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=49+49=98. So total 8's:98. Now, the difference is number of 4's minus number of 8's:188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, 484 is the 49th number. So, units place has 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, but 450-488 is beyond that. So, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, let me check the last block, 440-449. Since the book goes up to 488, 440-449 is entirely within that range, so it's valid. So, 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but similar to before, the actual count is 49 because 8, 18, ..., 488 is 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: 8 is the first, then 18, 28,..., 488. The difference between 488 and 8 is 480, so 480 / 10 = 48, plus 1 is 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let me count the blocks: 80-89 is in 0-99, 180-189 in 100-199, 280-289 in 200-299, 380-389 in 300-399. Wait, 480-489 would be another block, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that block, but only 9 numbers (480-488). So, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks each have 10 eights in the tens place, and the last block has 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 4 * 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights = 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are there than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through the fours again: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For the eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when I counted the tens place for fours, I considered 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours in the tens place. That seems correct. For the eights, in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks, but the last one only has 9 numbers, so 4 blocks of 10 and 1 of 9, totaling 49. So, that seems correct. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly? For fours, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. For eights, there's no hundreds place, so that's 0. So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, the total fours are 188, eights are 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 4 blocks \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as the book only goes up to 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then an extra 4 in 484, making it 49. Wait, no, maybe I should think differently. For the units place, in every block of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4, so 48. But then, in the incomplete block from 481 to 488, the units digit goes up to 8, so the next number after 480 is 481, 482, ..., 488. So, in the units place, 484 is the only number with a 4 in the units place in this incomplete block. So, total 4's in units place: 48 (from the complete blocks) + 1 (from the incomplete block) = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, how many such blocks are there? From 1 to 488, we have four blocks: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, actually, the first block where the tens digit is 4 is 40-49, which is in 0-99. Then, 140-149 in 100-199, 240-249 in 200-299, 340-349 in 300-399, and 440-449 in 400-488. So, that's five blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. But wait, let me check: 40-49: 10 numbers, 4's in tens place. 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So, that's 5\u00d710=50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Wait, but let me confirm: 400, 401, ..., 488. Yes, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? From 1 to 488, the number of 8's in the units place is the same as the number of times 8 appears in the units digit. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. But then, in the incomplete group from 481-488, the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included, which adds another 8. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 1 to 488, the blocks are: 0-99: 80-89, which is 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189, another 10. 200-299: 280-289, another 10. 300-399: 380-389, another 10. 400-488: Now, 480-489 would be the next block, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, in the hundreds block 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (from 0-399) plus 9 from 400-488. So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's: Units place: 49, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. Now for the 8's: Units place:49, Tens place:49, Hundreds place:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I feel like that might not be right because sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to miscount. Let me try a different approach to verify. Maybe I can count the number of times each digit appears in each position more carefully. Let's start with the 4's again. **Units place for 4's:** From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 4's in units place. Correct. **Tens place for 4's:** Numbers where tens digit is 4: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d710=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, 50 4's in tens place. Correct. **Hundreds place for 4's:** Numbers from 400-488. That's 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89 4's in hundreds place. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. Correct. Now for the 8's. **Units place for 8's:** Numbers ending with 8:8,18,28,...,488. The last one is 488. So, how many terms? (488-8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. **Tens place for 8's:** Numbers where tens digit is 8:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, so 4\u00d710=40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, total tens place 8's:40+9=49. Correct. **Hundreds place for 8's:** Since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0. Thus, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because when I think about page numbers, sometimes the counts might be slightly different, but I think my approach is correct. Let me check another way. Maybe I can write a small program or use another counting method, but since I can't do that here, I'll try to think differently. Alternatively, I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position. For units place: for both 4 and 8, it's (n//10)*1 + (1 if the remainder is >= the digit else 0). Wait, but maybe that's complicating. Alternatively, I can use the formula for digit counting. For a given digit d in a given position (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times it appears can be calculated based on higher digits and lower digits. But maybe that's overcomplicating for now. Alternatively, let me recount the 8's tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, 49 in tens place. Units place:49. So, 98 total. 4's:188. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but starting from 4, which is the 4th number in the first 10, so maybe it's better to calculate it as (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are. The blocks are 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 count fully? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488. So, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. Each of these pages has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but page 400 is the first page with a 4 in the hundreds place, and it goes up to 488. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many such numbers. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 =48 +1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's check each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9=49. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. Difference=188-98=90. Hmm, seems correct. Wait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, correct. And for 8's, in the tens place, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct because 488-480+1=9. So, yes, 49 in units, 49 in tens, total 98. So, the difference is indeed 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 100: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block has 10 occurrences, totaling 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears from page 400 to 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 100: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each block (except 480-488) has 10 occurrences. 480-488 has 9.\n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No 8's appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is the 49th number because starting from 0, 4 is the 1st, 14 is the 2nd, ..., 484 is the 49th. Hmm, but 484 is within 488, so yes, it's included. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is fully within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing an 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 times. Wait, 8,18,...,488. Let me check: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, the count is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each range has 10 numbers. Let's see how many such ranges are within 488.\n\n- 80-89: yes, that's 10 numbers.\n- 180-189: yes, 10.\n- 280-289: yes, 10.\n- 380-389: yes, 10.\n- 480-489: but 488 is the last page, so 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, so the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the end. So, in the hundreds place, 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, but the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, the tens place counts are:\n\n- 80-89: 10\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9\n\nAdding these up: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in the ranges.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 4,14,...,484: that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n- Tens: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n- Hundreds: 400-488: 488-400+1=89. Correct.\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 8,18,...,488: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n- Tens: 80-89:10; 180-189:10; 280-289:10;380-389:10;480-488:9. So, 4 ranges of 10 and one range of 9, total 49. Correct.\n- Hundreds: 0. Correct.\nTotal 8's:49+49=98. Correct.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I just thought, in the hundreds place for 4's, 400-488 is 89 numbers, but each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. Similarly, for 8's, in the hundreds place, there are none because the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as the book ends at 488.\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is the 49th occurrence because 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so the integer part is 48, but we include 484 as the 49th. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488, which is floor(488/10) = 48. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does 484 count as the 49th? Let me list them: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set would be 440-449. Let's see how many full sets of 100 there are. Each full hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-100: 40-49, that's 10 numbers. From 101-200: 140-149, another 10. From 201-300: 240-249, another 10. From 301-400: 340-349, another 10. From 401-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is 488/10=48.8, so floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. Let's see: Each hundred has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 1-100: 80-89, 10 numbers. From 101-200: 180-189, 10. From 201-300: 280-289, 10. From 301-400: 380-389, 10. From 401-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers because 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9). So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, which is 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. Difference=188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Yes, that's correct. And for 8's, in the tens place, from 401-488, the 8's in the tens place go up to 488, which is 480-488, that's 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. Units place: 49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, 98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in the tens place for 4's? From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Yes, that's correct. And in the units place, 49, and hundreds place 89. So, 188. For 8's, units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. So, 98. Therefore, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're only going up to 488, maybe it's better to calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're counting full groups, that's 48 times. But wait, in each group of 10, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 times. However, in the last partial group (481-488), 484 is included, which is another 4 in the units place. So, that's 49 times. Wait, maybe I should think differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place is equal to the number of times the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, for each hundred, there are 10 times where the units digit is 4. So, from 1 to 400, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, from 1-100, 4 appears 10 times (4,14,24,...,94). Similarly, from 101-200, another 10 times, and so on up to 400. So, 400 divided by 100 is 4, so 4 times 10, which is 40 times. Then, from 401-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 times in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, which is the 9th occurrence in the 401-488 range. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, in 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, how many such ranges are there up to 488? From 40-49: 10 times. From 140-149: 10 times. From 240-249: 10 times. From 340-349: 10 times. From 440-449: 10 times. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 times, so 5*10=50 times. However, we need to check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** How many times does 8 appear in the units place? Similar to 4, in each group of 10, 8 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many times? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 8 once, so 48 times. But wait, in the last partial group (481-488), 488 is included, which is another 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** How many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Similar to 4, each range of 100 has a range where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is the range. So, let's count: 80-89: 10 times. 180-189: 10 times. 280-289: 10 times. 380-389: 10 times. 480-488: 9 times (since 488 is included). So, total 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** How many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 times. Adding up all occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again about the tens place for 4. I had 5 ranges contributing 10 each, totaling 50. But wait, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. For 8's in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 ranges, but the last one only has 9 numbers (480-488). So, 4 ranges of 10 and one of 9, totaling 49. Correct. So, yes, 90 is the correct difference.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of 10 and one partial group (481-488). Each group contributes one 4, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred (e.g., 40-49, 140-149).

    "text": " So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since 484 is within the range, it's 49 times. Wait, no, maybe I should calculate it differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488, which is 48 full groups (480), plus one more for 484. So that's 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range, but 494 would be beyond 488, so 484 is the last one. So, from 4 to 484, that's 484 - 4 = 480, divided by 10 gives 48, plus 1 for the starting point, so 49 times. Hmm, maybe that's correct. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. How many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Each block of 100 numbers has a 4 in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). So, from 1 to 488, how many hundreds are there? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, 4 hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40 times. But wait, the last hundred is 401-500, but our book only goes up to 488, so the tens digit 4 in 400-488 is still 10 numbers (400-409, 410-419, etc., but wait, no, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, etc., but in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, 480-489. Wait, but 488 is the end, so in 400-488, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? Let me think differently. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, for each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 400, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 401 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So total tens place 4's would be 40 + 10 = 50 times. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because from 1 to 488, the hundreds place goes up to 4, but the tens digit 4 occurs in each hundred. Let me check again. From 1-100: 40-49 \u2192 10 times. From 101-200: 140-149 \u2192 10 times. From 201-300: 240-249 \u2192 10 times. From 301-400: 340-349 \u2192 10 times. From 401-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 times. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 times. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units place 49, tens place 50, hundreds place 89. Total 4's = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of it. So, each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 1-100: 80-89 \u2192 10 times. From 101-200: 180-189 \u2192 10 times. From 201-300: 280-289 \u2192 10 times. From 301-400: 380-389 \u2192 10 times. From 401-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 times (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the tens place, from 401-488, the 8's in the tens place occur 9 times. So total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (from 1-400) plus 9 in 401-488. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds place 0. Total 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. 188 - 98 = 90. That seems correct. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers. From 4 to 484, there are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in page numbers 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8 to 488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. The last range is 480-488, giving 9 occurrences, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in any page number since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 90 more times than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since 484 is the last one, it's actually 49 times. Hmm, maybe I should think differently. For the units place, the number of 4's from 1 to n can be calculated by (n // 10) + 1 if the units digit of n is >=4. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Every 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the total number is the number of complete groups of 10, which is 488 // 10 = 48. But wait, 488 is 48*10 + 8, so the 48th group ends at 480. Then, from 481 to 488, there's another 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, yes, 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within 481-488. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 40-49: 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149: 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249: 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349: 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449: 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's valid. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, the number of 8's in the units place is (488 // 10) + 1 if 488 mod 10 >=8. Wait, 488 mod 10 is 8, which is equal to 8, so yes. So, 488 // 10 = 48, so 48 +1 =49 times. Alternatively, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place, so 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and then the last group from 481-488 has another 8 at 488. So, 48 +1=49. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189: 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289: 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389: 10 numbers. From 400-488: 480-488: here, the tens digit is 8 from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but in the tens place, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 9 numbers. So, in the hundreds place 4, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many ranges? The first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, etc.) each have 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, the last range (480-488) has 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's: units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For the 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the 8's in the tens place, I had 480-488, which is 9 numbers. But does 480 count as a 8 in the tens place? Yes, because 480 has an 8 in the tens place. So, 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers. So, 4 ranges with 10 each (80-89, etc.) and one range with 9, so 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct. Similarly, for the 4's in the tens place, we had 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct. And in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4. So, 89. So, total 4's:188. 8's:98. Difference:90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference between their counts.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences (since the book doesn't reach 800).\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but page numbers start at 1, so 4 is the first, and 484 is the 49th. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, for 10 consecutive numbers each time. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 8 appears in the units place at 488 as well. So, the first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. How many numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, for 10 consecutive numbers each time. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me check if 480-489 is within the book. Since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. So, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks. Each block has 10 numbers except the last one, which has 9 numbers (480-488). So, 4 blocks with 10 each and 1 block with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Therefore, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 times. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Wait, maybe I made a mistake there. Let me think again. The number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488 is calculated by dividing 488 by 10, which gives 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48 times. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so it's 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so that's 48. But wait, when you reach 484, that's the last 4 in the units place before 488. So, maybe it's 49 times because from 4 to 484, that's 48 intervals of 10, but including both endpoints, it's 49 numbers. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me use a formula. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is given by floor(N/10) + (1 if the units digit of N is >= d else 0). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, for each complete group of 10 numbers, the digit d appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups of 10 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8). So, 48 times. But then, we have 8 left over (since 488 - 480 = 8). Now, in the units place of these 8 numbers (481 to 488), does the units digit include a 4? 481 has 1, 482 has 2, 483 has 3, 484 has 4, and then 485 to 488 don't. So, in the incomplete group, there's one more 4 in the units place (at 484). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, so 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, counting how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, from 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. Let's see how many complete hundreds we have. From 1-99: 40-49 is one set, so 10 times. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 times, so 5\u00d710=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, inclusive. So, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times. Wait, but when counting digits, each number contributes one digit in the hundreds place if it's a three-digit number. So, yes, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** How many times does 8 appear in the units place from 1 to 488? Similar to the 4's, it's every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8. So, 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Now, in the incomplete group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** How many times does 8 appear in the tens place? The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 is present from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, let's count each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 times. - 180-189: 10 times. - 280-289: 10 times. - 380-389: 10 times. - 480-488: 9 times (since 488 is the last page). So, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** How many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, seems correct. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** \n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 4. \n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups of 10, contributing 48 fours.\n   - The incomplete group (481-488) includes 484, adding one more 4.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** \n   - 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - There are five such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Each range contributes 10 fours.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** \n   - From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4.\n   - There are 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive).\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** \n   - Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers contribute one 8.\n   - 48 complete groups and the incomplete group (481-488) includes 488.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** \n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Five complete ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488).\n   - The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and 480-488 contributes 9.\n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** \n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. The number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488 is calculated by dividing 488 by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4. But since 488 is the last number, and 488 has an 8 in the units place, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, no. Let me clarify: For each ten numbers (e.g., 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of ten do we have? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, which is 488, so the 48th set ends at 480, and then we have 481-488. In the 481-488 range, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so the next 4 would be at 484, which is within this range. So, that's an additional 4 in the units place. Therefore, total 4's in the units place are 48 (from the complete sets) + 1 (from 484) = 49. Wait, no. Because 488 is the last page, and 480 is the end of the 48th set. Then 481-488 is the 49th set, but it's incomplete. So, in the units place, in the 49th set, only 481-488, so 8 numbers. The digit 4 appears once in this set (484). So, total units place 4's: 48 (from 1-480) + 1 (484) = 49. Okay, so units place: 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the digit 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there in 488 pages? Let's see: The first is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but does 440-449 go beyond 488? 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So, tens place: 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 89 times.\n\nNow, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nSimilarly, we'll check units, tens, and hundreds place.\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The last number is 488, which is included. So, how many terms? Let's see: The first term is 8, which is 8 = 8 + 10*(n-1). The last term is 488. So, 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. 10*(n-1) = 480. n-1=48. So, n=49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many full ranges? Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, the first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last one contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nTotal number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's:188, total 8's:98. Difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units:49. Correct, because from 1-488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place, and since 488 is the last, the last 4 in units is 484, which is the 49th occurrence.\n\n- Tens:50. Because 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449: that's five sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds:89. From 400-488, inclusive. 488-400+1=89. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:49. From 8,18,...,488. Each 10 numbers have one 8 in units, and 488 is included, so 49 times. Correct.\n\n- Tens:49. As calculated above: four full decades (80-89, etc.) and one partial (480-488), totaling 49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds:0. Correct, as 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98. Correct.\n\nDifference:188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again: Is there any overlap where a page number has both 4 and 8? For example, 48 has both 4 and 8, but when counting digits, each digit is counted separately. So, in 48, the 4 is counted once in the tens place, and the 8 is counted once in the units place. So, no overlap issue. So, my counts are correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full ranges and one partial (480-488), totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 1-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, does 440-449 fall within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5*10=50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But we're only interested in the hundreds digit being 4, so each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: Units place: 49, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. Total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. Correct. Tens place: Each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. From 0-488, how many hundreds? 0-99: 1 block, 100-199: another, 200-299: another, 300-399: another, 400-488: partial. So, 5 blocks in total, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So total 4's: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8,18,28,...,488. The last number is 488. So, how many terms? (488 -8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199:180-189 (10). From 200-299:280-289 (10). From 300-399:380-389 (10). From 400-488: The next would be 480-489, but 488 is the last page. So, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (from 0-399) plus 9 in 400-488. So, 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the 8's: Units place:49, Tens place:49, Hundreds place:0. Total 8's:49+49=98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For 4's: Units 49, Tens 50, Hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: Units 49, Tens 49. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.

    "text": " So, 484 is the 49th number. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, since the book goes up to 488, the last block is 440-449, which is within 488. So, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 1-99: 40-49 (10 numbers) 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers) 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers) 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers) 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers) Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's. Now, adding them up: Units place: 49, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. Total 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The last number is 488, which is within the range. To find how many, divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full tens. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because it's the 49th multiple of 10. Let me list them: 8,18,...,488. The first is 8 (1st), then 18 (2nd), ..., 488 is the 49th. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. Now, the book goes up to 488, so 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 8's. So, 4 * 10 = 40 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: Units place: 49, Tens place: 40, Hundreds place: 0. Total 8's = 49 + 40 + 0 = 89. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 89 (number of 8's) = 99. Wait, that can't be right because when I did the 4's, I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me double-check the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's there. But when counting the units place for 4's, I had 49, which seems correct because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. Similarly, for the tens place, 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, etc.), each with 10 numbers, so 50. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 4's. For 8's: units place 49, tens place 40, so 89 total. So, 188 - 89 = 99. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because when I first thought about the hundreds place for 4's, I thought maybe it's 89, but let me confirm. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Yes, that's correct. So, the difference is 99. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the units place for 8's. Let me check: the units place 8's go up to 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10. So, 8,18,...,488: that's 49 numbers. Similarly, for the tens place, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10. So, 4 blocks, each 10 numbers, so 40. So, total 8's: 49 + 40 = 89. So, 188 - 89 = 99. Wait, but I think I might have overcounted the 4's in the hundreds place. Because from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. So, the difference is 99. But let me think again: maybe I should check with smaller numbers to see if my method is correct. For example, let's say a book with 100 pages. How many 4's and 8's? Units place: 4,14,...,94: 10 numbers. Tens place: 40-49: 10 numbers. Hundreds place: none. So, total 4's: 10 + 10 = 20. For 8's: units place: 8,18,...,98: 10 numbers. Tens place: 80-89: 10 numbers. So, total 8's: 10 + 10 = 20. So, difference is 0. Wait, but according to my method, it would be 20 - 20 = 0, which is correct. So, my method works here. Another test: a book with 200 pages. Units place 4's: 4,14,...,194: 20 numbers. Tens place 4's: 40-49,140-149: 20 numbers. Hundreds place: none. So, 40 4's. For 8's: units place: 8,18,...,198: 20 numbers. Tens place: 80-89,180-189: 20 numbers. So, 40 8's. Difference is 0. Wait, but according to my method, it's 40 - 40 = 0, which is correct. Hmm, but in the original problem, the difference is 99. That seems a bit high, but maybe it's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. Let me recount: from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 4's. Units place: 49, Tens place: 50, so total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. For 8's: units place: 49, tens place: 40, so total 89. So, 188 - 89 = 99. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers.

    "text": " So, 484 is the 49th occurrence. Hmm, maybe I should calculate it as (488 // 10) + 1 if the last number is 484. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, but since 484 is within 488, it's 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place can have 4 in positions like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449, and then 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, we'll only go up to 488. Let's see how many full groups of 100 there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. The range 440-449 also has 10 numbers. Now, 480-488 is another range where the tens digit is 8, but wait, no, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. Wait, no, 480-488: the tens digit is 8, so that's not where 4 appears in the tens place. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake here. Let me correct that. The tens digit is 4 in the ranges where the tens digit is 4, regardless of the hundreds digit. So, 40-49: tens digit is 4. 140-149: tens digit is 4. 240-249: tens digit is 4. 340-349: tens digit is 4. 440-449: tens digit is 4. Now, 480-488: the tens digit is 8, so that's where 8's would be, not 4's. So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 5 groups of 10 numbers each. Each group has 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50. Wait, but let me check the last group: 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 5 groups, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4 in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, 488 is included. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is the last range. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, tens place: 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units place, I thought 49, tens place 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 4's. Let me check again. Tens digit is 4: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 groups, each 10 numbers, so 50. That's correct. For 8's, tens digit: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 4 x 10 + 9 = 49. Correct. Units place for 8's: 8,18,...,488. How many? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 +1=49. Correct. So, 49 units, 49 tens, 0 hundreds: 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're only going up to 484, which is 484/10=48.4, but the actual count is 49 because 484 is included. Hmm, maybe I should think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, the last group is 480-488, which includes 484, so that's one more 4. So total units place 4's: 48 +1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the blocks are 40-49 (which is 10 numbers), 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's. So 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. So total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 +50=99; 99+89=188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. That's (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: Each block of 100 has 10 4's in the tens place, so from 0-488, there are 5 such blocks (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). Wait, but in 400-488, the tens place 4's would be from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. So total 4's: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The last number is 488, which is 488/10=48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. Wait, 8,18,...,488. The count is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. So 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place appears in blocks like 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Each block contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except possibly the last one. Let's see: From 0-488, the blocks are 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers. So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the last contributes 9. So total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: Units:49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. Total 188. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total 98. Difference:188-98=90. Hmm, but I feel like maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let me check the hundreds place for 4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct. For 8's, hundreds place: none, correct. Tens place for 8's: 80-89 (10),180-189(10),280-289(10),380-389(10), and 480-488(9). So 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Units place for 8's: 8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers, correct. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49, which is in the two-digit numbers. Then, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks in total. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449? Since the book goes up to 488, 440-449 is within the range. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, I'm only interested in the hundreds digit being 4, so each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but we have to check if 488 is included. 488 is the last page, so yes, it's included. So, from 8 to 488, every 10 numbers, so that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 8. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488. Let me count the blocks. The first block is 80-89 (10 numbers), then 180-189 (another 10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, the first four blocks each have 10 numbers, and the last block has 9. So, total tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, tens place: 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For the 8's: units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. 49+49=98. Correct. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. And for the tens place of 4's, 50 times, which includes 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. Units place for 4's: 49, because from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers, so 49 times. Similarly, for 8's, units place: 49, tens place: 49 (including the partial block at 480-488). So, yes, 98 total. So, the difference is 90.

This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so we don't need to consider that. Let's count how many full decades we have. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. Page numbers go up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. When is the hundreds digit a 4? That's from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds place has 89 occurrences of 4. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of the range. Let's count each full set first. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. Now, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, total in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, totaling 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that can't be right because I think I might have made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. Let me double-check that. When counting the hundreds place for 4's, I said from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. But wait, does each of those numbers have a 4 in the hundreds place? Yes, because 400-488 all start with 4. So, that part seems correct. Now, for the eights, in the tens place, I counted 4 full decades (80-89, 180-189, etc.) each contributing 10, and then 480-488 contributing 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. That seems correct. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so total 98 eights. 4's: 188. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but earlier I thought 4's were 188, and 8's were 98, so the difference is 90. But I'm a bit confused because when I think about page numbers, maybe I missed something. Let me cross-verify. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as for each digit position, count the number of 4's and 8's separately. Let's try that again. For 4's: units, tens, hundreds. Units: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? As before, 49 times. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, etc., which is 5 sets of 10, so 50 times. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 times. So total 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. For 8's: units place: 49 times. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set is only 9 numbers. So, 4 full sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) and 9 in the last partial set. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. Hundreds place: 0. So total 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in the hundreds place, I might have made a mistake. Let me check the hundreds place again. For 4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. For 8's: there's no page number with 8 in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488. So, 0. So, the count for 8's in the hundreds place is correct. So, 90 seems to be the correct difference. But wait, let me think again. When I count the units place for 4's, I have 49, and for 8's, also 49. In the tens place, 4's have 50 and 8's have 49. In the hundreds place, 4's have 89 and 8's have 0. So, 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " So, 484 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 484 is the 49th? Let me think again. The first 4 is at 4, which is the 1st. Then every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms can be calculated as ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. - 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nBut wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid because 449 is less than 488. However, 450-459 would have 4 in the hundreds place, but that's not relevant here. So, each of these ranges gives 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such ranges. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times. Wait, let me double-check that addition: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is valid. Let's see how many ranges we have. - 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, the first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last one contributes 9. So, total in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9 (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times. Wait, that can't be right because 49+49 is 98, but let me check again. Units: 49, tens: 49, hundreds: 0. So, total 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4 to 484, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400 to 488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8 to 488, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think differently. For the units place, each 10 numbers contribute one 4. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So that's 48 times. But wait, the 488th page is included, so the last group is 480-488, which includes 484, so that's the 49th occurrence. Hmm, maybe I should calculate it as (488 + 1) // 10, which is 48.9, but since we're dealing with integers, it's 48 full groups, but the last group might have an extra. Wait, let me think again. The number of times a digit appears in the units place can be calculated as the floor of (n / 10) + 1 if the digit is less than or equal to the units digit of n. Wait, maybe a better formula is to take the number of complete decades and then add 1 if the units digit is >= the target digit. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider each position separately. Let me try a different approach. For the units place, the number of 4's is equal to the number of times 4 appears in the units digit from 1 to 488. So, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, total groups of 10 in 488 numbers is 48 full groups (since 48*10=480) and then 8 more numbers (481-488). So, in each group, there's one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more at 484. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, so 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these decades contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, how many such decades are there up to 488? Let's see: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 decades. Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488, so yes. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. Each number here has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens place:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Hmm, but wait, let me think again. Is the hundreds place 89? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Yes, that's correct. So total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** How many 8's in the units digit from 1 to 488. Each group of 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. So, number of complete groups is 48 (since 48*10=480), and then 8 more numbers (481-488). So, in each group, one 8, so 48 times. In the last partial group, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once at 488. So total units place 8's: 48 +1=49. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in decades like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these contributes 10 8's in the tens place. How many such decades are there? 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). Wait, but 380-389 is within 488, so that's 4 decades. So 4*10=40. Now, do we have a 480-489 decade? But our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that decade. So, does 480-488 count as a full decade? No, because it's only 9 numbers (480-488). So, the tens digit here is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. Wait, but earlier I thought of decades as 10 numbers, so 480-489 would be a full decade, but since we only go up to 488, it's only 9 numbers. So, does that mean in the tens place, we have an extra 9 8's? Wait, no. Because 480-488 is part of the 480-489 decade, but since we're stopping at 488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have 4 full decades (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 4*10=40, plus the partial decade 480-488 contributing 9 8's. So total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49. Wait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 occurrences. So, yes, 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total 8's:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the tens place for 4's. I had 5 decades: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each contributes 10 4's, so 5*10=50. That's correct. For 8's in tens place, I had 4 full decades (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) and a partial one (480-488). Each full decade gives 10, so 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. That seems right. Units place for both digits: 4's and 8's both had 49 occurrences. So, yes, 49 each. So, the difference is 90. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, and hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4, totaling 48.\n   - The last partial group (481-488) includes 484, adding one more 4.\n   - **Total units place 4's:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Decades where the tens digit is 4: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each decade contributes 10 4's, and there are 5 such decades.\n   - **Total tens place 4's:** 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Numbers from 400 to 488 have 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - There are 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1).\n   - **Total hundreds place 4's:** 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers contribute one 8.\n   - 48 complete groups of 10 give 48 8's.\n   - The last partial group (481-488) includes 488, adding one more 8.\n   - **Total units place 8's:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Decades where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389.\n   - Each decade contributes 10 8's, and there are 4 such decades.\n   - The partial decade 480-488 contributes 9 8's.\n   - **Total tens place 8's:** 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - **Total hundreds place 8's:** 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, 484 is the 49th number. So, units place gives 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so that's 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 fours. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? Let me check: 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's valid. So, tens place gives 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). So, hundreds place gives 89 fours. Now, adding them up: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place gives 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, for each range except the last one, there are 10 numbers. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9. So, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800 onwards, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place gives 0 eights. Adding them up: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Now, subtracting the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place \u2192 0 times.\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but page numbers start at 1, so the first page with a 4 in the units place is 4, which is the 4th page. So, from 4 to 484, how many steps of 10 are there? The formula is ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. This happens in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), but let's check. From 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the number of 4's: units place: 4,14,...,484. That's 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, 5 blocks, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct. Now for 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, etc.) and 480-488 which is 9 numbers. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds. Total 98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That's correct. And for the tens place, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks of 10, 50. Units place: 49. So, 188. For 8's, units place: 49, tens place: 49, so 98. So, difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so for each 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, which gives 48 occurrences, and then in the 49th set (481-490), the units digit 4 appears once at 484. So that's 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range, so yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such blocks exist. - First block: 40-49: 10 numbers. - Second block: 140-149: 10 numbers. - Third block: 240-249: 10 numbers. - Fourth block: 340-349: 10 numbers. - Fifth block: 440-449: 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences, so 5 * 10 = 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Since the book has 488 pages, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll go through each digit position similarly. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me see how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, which gives 48 occurrences, and then in the 49th set (481-490), the units digit 8 appears once at 488. So that's 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last block. Let's count each block: - First block: 80-89: 10 numbers. - Second block: 180-189: 10 numbers. - Third block: 280-289: 10 numbers. - Fourth block: 380-389: 10 numbers. - Fifth block: 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488). So, the first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the fifth contributes 9. So total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0. Now, adding up all occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times. Wait, that seems off because I thought earlier that the 8 in the hundreds place would contribute, but since the book is only 488 pages, it doesn't go beyond 488, so no hundreds digit is 8. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers.

    "text": " Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. The first 4 in the units place is at 4, which is the 4th page. Then every 10 pages after that. So, from 4 to 484, how many steps of 10 are there? Let's calculate (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, and so on up to 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first 8 is at page 8, and the last is at 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's see how many ranges that is. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that can't be right because I think I might have made a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. Let me double-check that. From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. That seems correct. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. So, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. For 8's, in the tens place, I had 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds: 98 total. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me check again because sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to make an off-by-one error. Let me recount the 4's in the units place: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10 \u2192 480 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 4's in units. Similarly, for 8's in units: 8,18,...,488. 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2192 480 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 8's in units. For 4's in tens: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each range has 10 numbers, so 5 ranges: 5*10=50. For 8's in tens: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 5 ranges, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 8's in tens. 4's in hundreds: 400-488: 89 numbers. 8's in hundreds: 0. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. Total 8's:49+49+0=98. So, difference:188-98=90.

So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place, 4 can appear in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, and so on. The highest range would be 440-449, which is still within 488. So, how many ranges are there? Starting from 40-49 (40s), then 140s, 240s, 340s, and 440s. That's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine.

But wait, the hundreds digit is only 4 in these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same method: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers. How many such ranges are there? From 80-89 (80s), 180s, 280s, 380s. That's 4 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 4 x 10 = 40. But wait, does 480-489 exist? Since the book has 488 pages, 480-488 is part of the page numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, instead of 10, it's 9. So, for the 480s, it's 9 numbers. Therefore, total in the tens place: 3 ranges of 10 (80s, 180s, 280s) = 30, plus 9 from 480-488. So, 30 + 9 = 39. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (39) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 39 = 88. So, 88 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (4's) - 88 (8's) = 100. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For the 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For the 8's: units 49, tens 39, hundreds 0. 49+39=88. So, 188-88=100. Hmm, but I feel like that might be off because when I think about page numbers, the hundreds place for 4's only goes up to 488, which is 89 numbers, but for 8's, the hundreds place doesn't exist. Wait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. I had 80s, 180s, 280s, and 380s, each contributing 10, so 40, but then 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, total 49. Wait, no, the units place for 8's is 49, as calculated earlier. Let me see: units place for 8's: 8,18,...,488. The last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. Wait, that's 5 ranges, but 480-488 is the fifth. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct this. The tens place for 8's: The ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, and the last one has 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, the tens place contributes 49. But earlier, I thought it was 39, which was incorrect. So, I must have miscalculated earlier. Wait, no, because when I calculated the tens place, I considered 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 ranges, with the last one having 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, the tens place for 8's is 49. Then, units place is also 49. So, total 8's would be 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98. Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought it was 88. Let me clarify. Wait, no, I think I confused myself. Let me approach this differently. For the digit 8, let's calculate the number of times it appears in each position.\n\n**Units place for 8's:**\nNumbers are 8,18,28,...,488. The first is 8, the last is 488. The total count is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 =48 +1=49. So, 49 times.\n\n**Tens place for 8's:**\nNumbers where the tens digit is 8. These are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, and the last range (480-488) has 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 times.\n\n**Hundreds place for 8's:**\nAs before, there are no page numbers from 800-899, so 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nWait, that's different from what I had earlier. So, earlier I thought 8's were 88, but now I'm getting 98. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, let's recount:\n\nFor the tens place of 8's:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nSo, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 88, which was wrong. So, correct total 8's is 98.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50+89=188.\n\nSo, difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, that's different from my initial calculation. So, where did I go wrong earlier?\n\nI think earlier I miscalculated the tens place for 8's. I thought it was 39, but it's actually 49.\n\nSo, correct total 8's:98.\n\nThus, difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check again.\n\nWait, for the tens place of 8's, I have 5 ranges:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four has 10 numbers, and the last has 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place contributes 49.\n\nUnits place:49.\n\nSo, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:50 (since 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 5*10=50.\n\nHundreds:400-488:89 numbers.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188.\n\nThus, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 8's were 88, but now it's 98, which changes the difference to 90. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial calculation of 8's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this by calculating the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position separately, ensuring I don't miss any ranges.\n\nLet me try another approach: for each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of 4's and 8's.\n\n**Units place:**\n\nFor 4's: numbers ending with 4 from 4,14,24,...,484.\n\nNumber of terms: (484 -4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49.\n\nFor 8's: numbers ending with 8 from 8,18,28,...,488.\n\nNumber of terms: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49.\n\n**Tens place:**\n\nFor 4's: numbers where tens digit is 4. These are 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449.\n\nEach range has 10 numbers, so 5 ranges *10=50.\n\nFor 8's: numbers where tens digit is 8. These are 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488.\n\nFirst four ranges:10 each, last range:9 numbers.\n\nSo, 4*10 +9=49.\n\n**Hundreds place:**\n\nFor 4's: numbers where hundreds digit is 4:400-488.\n\nNumber of numbers:488-400 +1=89.\n\nFor 8's: no numbers have hundreds digit 8, since the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, 0.\n\nNow, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 100. So, where did I go wrong? I think in my initial calculation, I miscalculated the tens place for 8's, thinking it was 39 instead of 49. So, the correct difference is 90.\n\nBut let me confirm once more.\n\nYes, 4's:188, 8's:98, difference 90.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since 484 is the last one, it's 49 times. Wait, no, because 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me count how many sets of ten there are. Each set contributes 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is only 10 numbers, so 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in each of these, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 times. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 times. Wait, 8,18,...,488. Let me check: 8\u00d71=8, 8\u00d72=16? Wait, no, that's not right. Each occurrence is every 10 numbers, so starting at 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is given by the formula: ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place: 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each set contributes 10 numbers. Let's see how many sets there are. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. Now, 480-489 would be another set, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place, we have 4 full sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4\u00d710=40, plus the partial set 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 times.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49+50=99; 99+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but when I counted the 4's in the tens place, I considered 5 sets: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's correct because each hundred has a set where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 sets \u00d710=50.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, I considered 4 full sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 4\u00d710=40 +9=49. That's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAnd for 8's in the hundreds place, since 800 is beyond 488, it's zero. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This occurs every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 instances.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.

    "text": " So, 484 is the 49th occurrence. Therefore, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for a block of 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences of 4. Wait, let me check: 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. The count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so it's 49 occurrences. Let me check: 8, 18, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because 488 is the 49th term. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see: From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: The next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens place 8 occurs 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (from 0-399) and 9 in 400-488. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can only appear in the hundreds place if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.

From 8 to 488, stepping by 10: that's (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49 times.

Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last one, 480-488, which only has 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9). Wait, no: 480 is the first, then 481, ..., up to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 numbers, and the last one (480-488) has 9 numbers. So, that's 4*10 +9=49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 8's. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations because 188-98=90, but I'm not sure if I counted correctly.\n\nWait, for the 4's in the units place, I thought it was 49, but let me recount. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So that's correct.\n\nIn the tens place for 4's: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). So that's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place for 4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo total 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,28,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 8 more than 480, so 488-8=480, 480/10=48, so 48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So that's 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but the book only goes up to 488, so when counting 4's in the hundreds place, it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. That seems right.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10 occurrences.\n   - There are 5 such ranges (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n   - Total: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences (488 - 400 + 1).\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and 480-488 contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, but since 484 is included, it's 49 times. Wait, but 484 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 4 (which is the 1st), each 10 numbers add one more. So, 488 pages mean the last page is 488, so the units digit 4 appears up to 484, which is the 49th time. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's one set. Then 140-149, another. Then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, does 440-449 fall within 488 pages? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, how many sets is that? Let's see: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets. Each set has 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, does the last set go up to 449? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4. This occurs from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. Let's calculate: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that happens. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times. Wait, but let me check: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, 8 + 10(n-1) = 488 => 10(n-1) = 480 => n-1 = 48 => n=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8. This occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many full sets there are. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-489: but since the book ends at 488, only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many full sets? 4 sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 numbers, and one partial set from 480-488 contributing 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. Wait, but let me think again: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8. This would occur from page 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero occurrences of 8 in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. Wait, that's 98? But let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so total 98. Wait, but I thought earlier that in the tens place, it's 49, but let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49, yes. So, 49 in tens place. So, total 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, for the 4's in the hundreds place, I had 400-488, which is 89 numbers, correct? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. That seems right.\n\nFor the 8's in the units place: 8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers, correct.\n\nFor the 8's in the tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 49, correct.\n\nSo, 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 4's again. I had 5 sets: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each set has 10 numbers, so 5x10=50. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49.\n\nYes, so 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to miscount. Let me try another approach to verify.\n\nAlternative method: For each digit position, count the number of 4's and 8's separately.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nNumber of 4's in units place: floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 is included, we check if 488 has a 4 in units place? No, it's 8. So, the last 4 in units place is 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: same logic, 49.\n\nFor tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's in tens place: Each hundred has a block where tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers. From 0-99:40-49 (10). 100-199:140-149 (10). 200-299:240-249 (10). 300-399:340-349 (10). 400-488:440-449 (10). So, 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place: Each hundred has a block where tens digit is 8, which is 10 numbers. From 0-99:80-89 (10). 100-199:180-189 (10). 200-299:280-289 (10). 300-399:380-389 (10). 400-488:480-488 (9). So, 4 full blocks (10 each) and one partial block (9). So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's in hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nNumber of 8's in hundreds place: None, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, maybe I should think of it as (484 - 4)/10 + 1. So, (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Yeah, that makes sense. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers long. Let's see how many complete ranges there are. From 1-488, the tens place can be 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440 is 440, which is within 488, so yes, it's valid. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. Now, let's add them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many. The last occurrence is at 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 exist? Yes, but since the book has 488 pages, 480-488 is part of the range. So, how many ranges are there? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, total for tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers is 188, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. Subtracting these gives 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " So, 484 is the 49th number. Hmm, maybe I should think differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place up to N can be calculated as floor((N + 1) / 10). So, for 488, floor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10) = 48. So, 48 times in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the units digit cycles every 10. Let me confirm with a smaller number. For example, up to 10: 4 is once. Up to 20: 4 appears twice (4 and 14). Up to 30: 4 appears three times (4,14,24). So, yes, for every 10 pages, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so the number of 4's in the units place is (488 // 10) = 48. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, for the tens place, 4 can appear in the tens digit. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). 100-199: 140-149 (10). 200-299: 240-249 (10). 300-399: 340-349 (10). 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, how many blocks? Let's see, each hundred block has one set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 0-99: 1 block, 100-199: another, 200-299: another, 300-399: another, and 400-488: another. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. How many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is only 4, so every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 numbers. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 times. Now, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8's in the units place appear every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? Using the same method as before, floor((488 +1)/10) = floor(489/10) = 48. So, 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, does 488 count as an 8 in the units place? Yes, so that's included. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8's in the tens place. These occur in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many full blocks and partial blocks. - 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). - 100-199: 180-189 (10). - 200-299: 280-289 (10). - 300-399: 380-389 (10). - 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the last block contributes 9. So total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, total 8's: 97. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers.

Let's count how many such ranges there are: - 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nThat's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 here, so how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me check again. The hundreds place is 4 for numbers 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. How many such numbers are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does 488 count as one occurrence? Yes, so units place has 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place for numbers from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers except the last one, which has 9 numbers (from 480 to 488). Let's count: - 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers\n\nSo, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference. \n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 occurrences (4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n   - **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488).\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 occurrences (8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n   - **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
