    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, in the units place, from 1 to 488, the number of 4's is 49 because 484 is the 49th occurrence. Hmm, maybe I should use a formula. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is equal to floor(n/10) + 1 if the units digit of n is >= d, otherwise floor(n/10). Wait, maybe that's complicating it. Alternatively, for each digit position, the count can be calculated by considering higher digits and lower digits. But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of how many full decades there are. Let me try this: For the units place, every 10 numbers have exactly one 4. So, from 1 to 480, there are 480 numbers, which is 48 sets of 10, so 48 fours in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, we have 484, which is another 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, so 49 fours in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours. So 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, let's add up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many 8's in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, does 488 count as an extra? 488 is the last page, so the units digit is 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place 8's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8. Each of these ranges contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. The last one, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so only 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one range of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (4, 14, ..., 484)\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449)\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488)\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (8, 18, ..., 488)\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488)\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should think of it as (488 // 10) + 1? Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 484 is the last one, which is 484 = 48*10 + 4, so it's 48 times, but starting from 4, so 48 times. Wait, maybe it's better to calculate it as (488 + 1) // 10, which would be 489 // 10 = 48.9, so 48 times. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have a 4 in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is 48*10 + 8, so the last number with a 4 in the units place is 484, which is 48*10 + 4. So yes, 48 times. So, 48 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. The hundreds digit can be 0 (for 40-49), 1 (140-149), 2 (240-249), 3 (340-349), and 4 (440-449). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488? Yes, so all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's. Wait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first, 401, ..., 488. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, so 48 numbers. But wait, 488 is included, so 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, 8,18,...,488. Let's see: 8 is the first, then 18, 28,..., 488. The last one is 488, which is 48*10 + 8. So, how many? It's 488//10 = 48.8, so 48 times, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times. Wait, no. Wait, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then a partial group from 481 to 488, which includes 488. So, 48*1 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 can appear in the tens place. The ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) have 10 numbers each, contributing 10 8's each. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers, contributing 9 8's. So, total in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's: units: 48, tens: 50, hundreds:89. 48+50=98+89=187. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 187-98=89. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers.

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups. In each group, the units digit is 4 once, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 itself ends with an 8, not a 4. So, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence because 484 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 4. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then 14, 24, ..., up to 484. The sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The difference between consecutive terms is 10, so the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges exist. The first is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But in the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but 400 to 488: the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, last is 488. The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these is 10 numbers. Let's count how many such ranges there are. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. Now, 480-489 would be another, but since the book ends at 488, we only go up to 488. So, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, we have 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, plus the partial range 480-488, which contributes 9. So total in tens place: 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. Difference=188-98=90. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Yes, that's correct. For the tens place of 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Units place: 49. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49. Wait, in the tens place, I had 4 full ranges (80-89, etc.) each 10, plus 480-488, which is 9, so 4*10=40 +9=49. So, 49+49=98. So, yes, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '4' appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should calculate it as (484 - 4)/10 + 1. So, (484 - 4) is 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges exist. From 40-49: that's one set, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? Let me check: 440 is less than 488, and 449 is also less than 488, so yes, all 5 sets are within the range. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's calculate how many times. The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. Using the same method: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488. Let's count how many such ranges. From 80-89: that's one set, then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 5 sets. Each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, but the last set (480-488) has 9 numbers because 489 is beyond 488. So, 4 sets with 10 numbers each and 1 set with 9 numbers. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because I thought the hundreds place for 8 would be zero, which it is, so that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I overcounted the tens place for 8? Let me check the tens place again. For 8 in the tens place: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. So, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think of it as the number of times 4 appears in the units place up to 488. So, for each 10 numbers, there's one 4 in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups. Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48. But then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which adds another 4. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488? Yes, so all 5 ranges are valid. So 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, let me add up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, I'll do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, adding another 8. So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count how many such ranges there are. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-489 would be the next, but since the book only goes up to 488, the range is 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 numbers, contributing 4*10=40 8's. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 more 8's in the tens place. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, the last group is 480-488, which includes 484 as the 4 in the units place. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 times? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: For each 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4. So, 48 times. But wait, the 48th ten would end at 480, and then from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is within that range, adding one more 4. So total is 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, counting the number of times 4 appears in the tens place. This happens every 100 numbers, for 10 consecutive numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within the range, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, and 450-459 would be next, but 488 is less than 459, so 440-449 is the last set. So, how many sets are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first set (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 times. Wait, but wait: 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's included. So, 5 sets, 10 each, so 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 in the hundreds place appears from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is included, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, 48 times? Wait, let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms? The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. This occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, 480-488 is part of this range. So, how many sets? 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last). So, total is 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8 in the hundreds place. This would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Maybe I should think of it as (488 // 10) + 1 if the last number is 484. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer division would be 48, but since 484 is less than 488, it's the 49th occurrence. Hmm, maybe it's better to calculate it as (488 + 1) // 10. Let me test: (488 + 1) is 489, divided by 10 is 48.9, which truncates to 48. But that doesn't include 484. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think differently: the number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to N is equal to the number of complete decades plus one if the units digit is >=4. Wait, maybe a better approach is to calculate for each position. Let me try again. For the units place: The number of 4's is equal to the number of times the units digit cycles through 0-9. From 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets. Each set contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, the last set is from 481 to 490, but our book ends at 488, so in the last incomplete set, the units digits go up to 8. So, in that last set, the 4 would be at 484, which is included. So, total units place 4's: 48 complete sets (each contributing one 4) plus one more for 484, making it 49. Wait, no, because 488 is the last page. So, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (1-480), and then 481-488. In 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once at 484. So total units place 4's: 48 * 1 (from each set) + 1 (from 484) = 49. Okay, so units place gives 49 4's.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but our book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included. Let me count how many such ranges there are. Each hundred has one such range. From 1-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). 100-199: 140-149 (10). 200-299: 240-249 (10). 300-399: 340-349 (10). 400-488: 440-449 (10). So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, it's included. So tens place gives 50 4's.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This occurs from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So hundreds place contributes 89 4's.\n\nNow, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So total 4's: 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, but let's see. The 8's in the units place occur at 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? Each set of 10 numbers has one such number. So 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is included, so in the last set (481-490), 488 is included. So that's 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place. Wait, no, because 488 is the last page. So from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 times (1-480), and then 481-488. In 481-488, the units digit 8 occurs once at 488. So total units place 8's: 48 (from 1-480) + 1 (from 488) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This occurs in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is included. Let's count how many ranges: 1-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers because 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers? Wait, 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So in the hundreds place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So total tens place 8's: 4 ranges with 10 each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. This occurs from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So hundreds place contributes 0 8's.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nSo 188 - 98 = 90. So there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 4's again. I had 5 ranges (40-49, 140-149, etc.), each contributing 10 4's. That's 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, I had 4 full ranges (80-89, etc.) contributing 10 each, and 480-488 contributing 9, so 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nUnits place for both 4 and 8: 49 each. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89 4's there. Correct.\n\nAnd for 8's, no hundreds place contributions. So yes, total 8's are 98.\n\nSo the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (including 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, contributing 10 times per hundred, totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (including 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, contributing 10 times per hundred, and 480-488 contributing 9 times, totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think of it as for each hundred, there are 10 numbers with 4 in the units place. So from 1-100, there are 10 such numbers (4,14,...,94). Similarly, from 101-200, another 10, and so on. Since 488 is less than 500, we have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. Each hundred contributes 10 4's in the units place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, that's 9 more 4's in the units place. So total units place 4's would be 40 + 9 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-100: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-200: 140-149 (10). From 200-300: 240-249 (10). From 300-400: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's correct, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This happens from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. So total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, then 99 + 89 = 188. So there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? From 1-488, the first 8 is at 8, and the last is at 488. To find how many, divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. So, taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8*1=8, 8*2=16, but wait, no, that's not right. Wait, each 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So from 1-480, there are 480/10 = 48 8's. Then, from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 is the 49th occurrence. So total units place 8's: 48 +1=49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 0-100: 80-89 (10). From 100-200: 180-189 (10). From 200-300: 280-289 (10). From 300-400: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. So how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So instead of 10, it's 9. So total tens place 8's: 4 ranges with 10 each, and 1 range with 9. So 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So hundreds place 8's: 0. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are there than 8's. So 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: Units place: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 8's. Let me check again. In the tens place, the 8's occur in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So total tens place 8's:40+9=49. That's correct. Similarly, units place:49, so 49+49=98. So the difference is indeed 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. There are 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. There are 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should calculate it as (488 // 10) + 1? Wait, no. Let me think again. For the units place, every 10 numbers have exactly one 4. So from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 4's. But wait, in the 480-488 range, the units place goes from 0 to 8, so 484 is included, which is the 48th occurrence. So, maybe it's 48 4's in the units place? Hmm, perhaps I was overcomplicating earlier. Let me confirm: from 1 to 488, the number of 4's in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48. So 48 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. The first is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but wait: 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. So total 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So 187 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many 8's in the units place? It's floor(488/10) = 48. But wait, 488 is included, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So that's 48 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count these ranges. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10 numbers. 280-289: 10 numbers. 380-389: 10 numbers. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. So 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 800, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (48) + tens (49) = 97. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. For 8's: units 48, tens 49. 48+49=97. So 187-97=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo solve this, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n**Counting the digit '4':**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit '4' appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think of it as (488 + 1) divided by 10, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the number of times a digit appears in the units place up to N is floor(N/10) + 1 if the digit is less than the next digit. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach. For the units place, the 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, the 48th group ends at 480, and then we have 481-488. So, in the 48th group, the units digit 4 appears at 484. So, that's 48 times, but actually, from 1 to 488, the units digit 4 appears at 4,14,24,...,484. Let's count how many: 484 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 4 as the first, then 14 is the second, up to 484 as the 49th. Wait, that can't be right because 488/10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. But when you include 484, which is the 49th occurrence, does that mean I have 49 4's in the units place? Hmm, maybe I should think of it as (488 + 1) // 10, which is 48.9, so 48 times. Wait, no, because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor(488/10) is 48, but since 484 is within 480-489, which is the 49th group, but 488 is less than 489, so maybe it's 48 times. I'm getting confused. Let me list some numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. The difference between each is 10, so the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times. So, units place: 49 4's. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, and since our book ends at 488, 440-449 is fully included. So, 5 ranges, 10 numbers each, so 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8. Wait, let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. Each full range (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, but 480-489 only goes up to 488, so that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many full ranges? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 full ranges with 10 each and one range with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts because 90 seems like a big difference. Let me recount the 4's and 8's.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's there.\n\nFor the tens place of 4's, from 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). So, 5*10=50. That seems right.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 49, as calculated earlier.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49, correct.\n- Tens place: 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each with 10, so 40, plus 480-488 which is 9, so total 49. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 0, correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I think about page numbers, sometimes the count might not be exactly as I calculated. Let me verify the units place for 4's again. From 4 to 484, stepping by 10, that's 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place, 8,18,...,488. ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place for 4's: 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, 50. Correct.\n\nTens place for 8's: 4 full ranges (80-89, etc.) plus 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 4*10 + 9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: 89 numbers, correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct, and the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think of it as the number of times 4 appears in the units place up to 488. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, which would give 48 occurrences, but since 488 is the last page, and 488's units digit is 8, not 4, so actually, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, because from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So that's 48 times. But wait, does the 48th set end at 480, and then from 481 to 488, the next set isn't complete, so the 48th set ends at 480, and then 481-488 is the 49th set, but in that, only 481-488, so the units digits are 1-8, so no 4 in the units place in that last partial set. So, total units place 4's: 48 times. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, the number of times a digit appears in the units place up to N can be calculated as floor(N/10) + 1 if the last digit is >= the digit. Wait, no, maybe it's better to think that for units digit 4, the numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. The last one is 484, which is 484 = 4 + 10*(k-1), so solving for k: 484 = 4 + 10k -10 \u2192 484 = 10k -6 \u2192 10k = 490 \u2192 k=49. So, 49 times. So, the units place 4's: 49 times. Similarly, for 8's in the units place: numbers are 8,18,28,...,488. The last one is 488, so how many? 488 = 8 + 10*(k-1) \u2192 488 = 8 +10k -10 \u2192 488=10k -2 \u219210k=490 \u2192k=49. So, 49 times for 8's in units place. Wait, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, both 4 and 8 in units place occur 49 times each? That can't be right because 488 is the last page, so maybe 8's in units place occur 49 times, but 4's in units place, the last is 484, which is within 488, so 49 times. So, units place: 4 appears 49 times, 8 appears 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, moving on to the tens digit. For the tens place, 4 can appear in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10, and so on. The last block would be 440-449, which is within 488. So, how many blocks? From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Wait, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. But what about 480-489? That's beyond 488, so we don't include that. So, only up to 440-449, which is 5 blocks. So, 5*10=50 times. Similarly, for 8's in the tens place: numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, how many blocks? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So total 4's in tens place:5 blocks, 5*10=50. 8's in tens place: first four blocks (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) contribute 10 each, so 4*10=40, plus the last block 480-488 contributes 9. So total 40+9=49 times. So, 4's in tens place:50, 8's in tens place:49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. For 4's, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. For 8's in the hundreds place: the hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no pages with hundreds digit 8. So, 8's in hundreds place:0. Now, let's sum up the counts: For 4's: units place 49, tens place 50, hundreds place 89. Total 4's:49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds place 0. Total 8's:49+49=98. Now, the difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place (1s):**\n   - **4's:** Occur every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **8's:** Occur every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens Place (10s):**\n   - **4's:** Occur in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **8's:** Occur in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.

    "text": " Maybe I should use a formula here. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to n is given by floor((n + 1)/10). So, for 4 in units place up to 488: floor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10) = 48. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, total blocks are 5, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 only for 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 4's. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's use the same formula as before: floor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10) = 48. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences except possibly the last one. Let's count: From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, the last block contributes 9 instead of 10. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the hundreds place with 8. So, 0 times. Adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. Now, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 187 - 97 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (every 10 numbers up to 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (10 per block from 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (pages 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = **187**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (every 10 numbers up to 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (10 per block from 80-89, 180-189, etc., with 480-488 contributing 9).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences (no page numbers in 800-899).\n\nTotal 8's = 48 + 49 + 0 = **97**.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think of it differently. For each set of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many full sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So that's 48 times. But wait, the last number is 488, which ends with an 8, so the 48th set ends at 480. Then from 481 to 488, there's another 4 in 484. So that's 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. Hmm, maybe my initial thought was correct. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89), but each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 times. Wait, but I think I'm overcomplicating it. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, inclusive. So that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, the last number is 488, which is an 8 in the units place, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. So, let's count the ranges: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, right? Wait, 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, that's 9 numbers. So, total in the tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and one range of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, but let me double-check. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9. So yes, 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that can't be right because I think I might have made a mistake in counting. Let me check again. Wait, when I counted 4's in the hundreds place, I said 89 times because from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. But actually, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89, so yes, that's correct. So, 4's total 188. For 8's, in the units place, I think I might have overcounted. Let me recount the units place for 8's. The numbers are 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms are there? The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place: 49. Tens place: as before, 49. So total 8's: 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a different method to count the digits. Maybe using place value positions separately. Let me try that. For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), count the number of 4's and 8's. Starting with 4's: Units place: For each complete set of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4. So, 48. But then, in the incomplete set from 481 to 488, there's another 4 in 484. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Tens place: For each complete set of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). From 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 100 are there? 4 complete sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. So, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now for 8's: Units place: Similarly, each set of 10 has one 8. From 1-488, 48 complete sets, so 48. Then, in the incomplete set, 488 is included, so that's one more, making it 49. Tens place: Each set of 100 has 10 8's in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). From 1-488, there are 4 complete sets, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the incomplete set 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. Hundreds place: As before, no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because I thought maybe the hundreds place for 4's was 89, but maybe it's 88? Let me check: From 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that seems correct. Similarly, for the tens place in 4's, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's correct. So, 4's total 188, 8's total 98, difference is 90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check again. The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 40 + 9=49. That's correct. So, 49 in tens place for 8's, 49 in units place, total 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the answer was 90, but I want to make sure. Let me try another approach. Maybe using a formula for digit counting. The number of times a digit d appears from 1 to n can be calculated using a formula, but I'm not sure I remember it correctly. Alternatively, I can think about each digit position separately. Let me try that again. For units digit: For 4's, as before, 49 times. For 8's, 49 times. For tens digit: 4's: 50 times. 8's: 49 times. For hundreds digit: 4's: 89 times. 8's: 0 times. So, 4's total: 49 + 50 +89=188. 8's total:49+49+0=98. Difference:188-98=90. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers.

    "text": " Maybe I should think of it as (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 0-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 would go up to 449, but our book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 488. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So 5 * 10 = 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 here. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The first is 8, and the last is 488. How many? Let's calculate: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count these blocks. From 0-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, that's 5 blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each block has 10 numbers except the last one, which has 9 numbers (from 480 to 488, inclusive). So, for the first four blocks: 4 * 10 = 40. The last block: 480-488 is 9 numbers. So total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.

So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4 (since 488 is less than 500). So, the blocks are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is only up to 488. So, in each of the first four blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times each. That's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, in the 401-488 block, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so how many times does 4 appear here? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The first is 8, and the last is 488. Using the same method as before: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 480/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. So, in each block of 100, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times. How many such blocks? From 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500. Again, the last block is only up to 488. So, the first four blocks each have 10 occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. In the 401-488 block, the tens digit 8 is in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 for the entire range 480-489, but since we're stopping at 488, it's still 9 numbers? Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 for all numbers from 480 to 489, but since we stop at 488, that's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). But wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, in the tens place for 8's in the last block, it's 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Adding up all the 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, subtracting the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. Difference is 90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check the tens place for 4's again. From 40-49: 10 numbers, then 140-149: another 10, 240-249: 10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct. For 8's, the tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. Wait, that's 4 full blocks (each 10) and one partial block with 9. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. Correct. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think again. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4. But wait, the last set is 481-490, but since the book only goes up to 488, the units digit 4 in 484 is included, so that's 48 +1? Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, which is the 49th occurrence. So, maybe it's 49 times. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me try another approach. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of times the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, for each 10 numbers, there's one 4. So, from 1 to 488, how many tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, and then in the 49th partial ten (481-488), we have 484, which is another 4. So, total 48 +1 = 49 times. So, 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's count the number of 4's in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go beyond 488? 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's valid. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, and then in the 49th partial ten (481-488), we have 488, which is another 8. So, 48 +1=49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, how many such ranges are there? 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40 8's in the tens place. Now, does 480-489 have a tens digit of 8? 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but 480-488 is within the book's pages. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's an additional 9 8's. Wait, so I initially thought 4 ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each with 10 8's, totaling 40. But 480-488 adds another 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 40+9=49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems right. But let me make sure I didn't overcount or undercount in any digit place. Units place for 4: from 4,14,...484. That's (484-4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place for 4: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place for 4: 400-488. 488-400+1=89. Correct. Units place for 8: 8,18,...488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place for 8: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-488. Wait, earlier I thought 480-488 adds 9 more, but 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So that's 4*10 +9=49. So, total 49 in tens place. So, yes, 49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any other ranges for 8's in the tens place. For example, 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is another 10, 380-389 is another 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, total 49. Correct. So, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, giving 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., plus 480-488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, the total number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the total number of complete decades (groups of 10) in 488 pages. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, does the last partial decade (481-488) include another 4 in the units place? Yes, 484 is within that range. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, so the units digit goes up to 8, but 484 is included. So, the units place 4's are 49 times. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as the number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of times 4 appears in each position. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate it as follows: For units place, the number of 4's is equal to the number of times 4 appears in the units digit from 1 to 488. That would be every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full times, and then check if the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include another 4. 484 is in there, so that's one more, making it 49. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the digit 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are within 488 pages. The first range is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many full ranges there are. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total tens place 8's: 4 ranges of 10 and one range of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so yes, 9. So, tens place: 4*10 +9=49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, hundreds place: 0 times. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think of it as the number of times 4 appears in the units place up to 488. Let me calculate it as follows: For each hundred, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9, so in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). Wait, but 488 is the last page, so actually, from 1-400, that's 400 pages, and then 88 more. So, for each hundred, 10 times 4 in the units place. So 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40. Then, from 401 to 488, which is 88 pages, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times. So total units place 4's: 40 + 9 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 count as 10 numbers? Yes, because 440,441,...,449 are all within 488. So, total tens place 4's: 5*10=50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. So, any number from 400 to 488 has 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 4's: 89. Now, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? Let's see, the first is 8, and the last is 488. To find how many, we can think of it as the number of times 8 appears in the units place up to 488. For each hundred, 10 times in the units place. So, 4 full hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, how many 8's in the units place? 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers. So total units place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Therefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm wondering if I counted correctly in the tens place for 4's and 8's. Let me check the tens place for 4's again. The ranges are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. For 8's, the tens place ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So that's 5 ranges, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct. Okay, so the difference is indeed 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference between their counts.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers.

    "text": " Maybe I should think of it as (488 // 10) + 1 if the last number is 484. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But 488 is the last page, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place 4's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? So let's count these blocks. From 0-99: 40-49: 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149: 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249: 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349: 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449: 10 numbers. Wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 449 is within 488, so that's fine. So each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall entirely within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, tens place 4's: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. So, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but wait, is the hundreds place correct? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place. So total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So how many such numbers? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But 488 is the last page, so does that count as the 49th occurrence? Wait, 8, 18, ..., 488. Let's see, 488 is included, so how many terms are there? The first term is 8, and the last term is 488. The nth term can be expressed as 8 + 10(n-1). So, 488 = 8 + 10(n-1). Subtract 8: 480 = 10(n-1). Divide by 10: 48 = n-1. So n = 49. So units place 8's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 fall within 488? 480-489 would be pages 480 to 489, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this block. So, how many full blocks are there? From 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189: 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289: 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389: 10 numbers. From 400-488: 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, the first four blocks each contribute 10 8's in the tens place, and the last block contributes 9. So total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So hundreds place 8's: 0. So total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 0-99: 80-89: 10. 100-199: 180-189: 10. 200-299: 280-289: 10. 300-399: 380-389: 10. 400-488: 480-488: 9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So yes, 49 in tens place. So total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So 188-98=90. So there are 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, I'm a bit unsure about the hundreds place for 4's. Let me recount that. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place. So that seems correct. For the tens place of 4's, from 40-49, 140-149, etc., each block is 10 numbers, and there are 5 blocks: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, but in 400-488, the tens place 4's would be 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So yes, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Units place for 4's: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So 484 - 4 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. So 49. So total 4's: 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. Tens place: 80-89,180-189, etc., up to 480-488. So 4 full blocks of 10, and one block of 9, totaling 49. So 49+49=98. So 188-98=90. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

This is 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. This is 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488. This is 0 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think differently. For each block of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks. Each block contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, the 48th block ends at 480, and then we have 481 to 488. In the 481-488 range, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which is another 4 in the units place. So that's 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. Hmm, maybe I was right the first time. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. Starting from 40-49: that's one range. Then 140-149: another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50 times. But wait, let me check the last range: 440-449. Since the book goes up to 488, 440-449 is within that, so yes, that's valid. So, 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. So, pages 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems high. Let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Wait, from 400 to 488 is indeed 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. So total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many? From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8. Each block of 10 has one, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, same as 4's in units place. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488. Let's count these ranges. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each of the first four ranges contributes 10, and the last one contributes 9. So total in tens place: 4 x 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place starting from 800, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me recount the hundreds place for 4's. Pages 400-488: that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 times. That seems correct. For 8's in the tens place, I considered 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 4 ranges of 10 and one range of 9, total 49. That's correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. But wait, let me think again. Wait, the problem says each page is printed once, so page 1 to 488. So, perhaps I'm overcounting somewhere. Let me try a different approach. Maybe using a formula for digit counting. For a given digit d, the number of times it appears in each position can be calculated as follows:\n\nIn the units place:\n- For each complete group of 10 numbers, d appears once.\n- Number of complete groups = floor(n / 10)\n- If the last group has numbers >= d, add 1 more.\n\nIn the tens place:\n- For each complete group of 100 numbers, d appears 10 times in the tens place.\n- Number of complete groups = floor(n / 100)\n- Then, look at the remainder: if the remainder is >= 10, add 10; else, add the remainder - 10 + 1.\n\nWait, maybe that's a better way. Let me apply this formula for 4's and 8's.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\nUnits place:\nn = 488\nNumber of complete groups of 10: floor(488 / 10) = 48\nRemainder: 488 % 10 = 8\nSince 8 >= 4, add 1 more.\nTotal units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\nNumber of complete groups of 100: floor(488 / 100) = 4\nEach group contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 x 10 = 40.\nRemainder: 488 % 100 = 88\nNow, the tens digit can be 4 in the range 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Since 88 >= 40, add 10.\nTotal tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nHundreds place:\nNumber of complete groups of 1000: floor(488 / 1000) = 0\nRemainder: 488\nNow, the hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. The number of such numbers is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\nSo, hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\nUnits place:\nn = 488\nComplete groups of 10: floor(488 / 10) = 48\nRemainder: 8\nSince 8 >= 8, add 1 more.\nTotal units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\nComplete groups of 100: floor(488 / 100) = 4\nEach group contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 x 10 = 40.\nRemainder: 88\nNow, the tens digit can be 8 in the range 80-89, which is 10 numbers. Since 88 >= 80, add 10.\nTotal tens place 8's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 49. Wait, no, because 488 is included, so in the tens place, the last group is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but in the formula, we're considering the tens digit as 8 in 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the last group is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the formula, when we have the remainder as 88, we check if the tens digit is 8 in that remainder. The tens digit in 88 is 8, so we add 10, but actually, it's only 9 numbers. Hmm, maybe the formula isn't perfect here. Wait, perhaps the formula counts 10, but in reality, it's 9. So, maybe I should adjust. Let me think. The formula says that if the remainder is >= 10, add 10. But in reality, if the remainder is 88, the tens digit can be 8 in 80-89, which is 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 88, it's 9 numbers. So, perhaps the formula overcounts by 1 in this case. Therefore, the tens place 8's would be 40 + 9 = 49, not 50. That makes sense because in the last group, 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but only up to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\nAs before, no 8's in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 90, but I'm a bit confused because I initially thought maybe 49 for tens place 8's, but with the formula, it's 50, but then realized it's 49. So, the correct total for 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups of 10, contributing 48 occurrences. The last group ends at 488, which includes another 4 (484), totaling 49.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges (including 440-449), each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to '4', 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 complete ranges contributing 40, and the last partial range (480-488) contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No occurrence since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think of it as from 1 to 488. So, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each ten, there's one 4 in the units place. So, how many tens are there in 488? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. But wait, does the 488th page include a 4 in the units place? No, 488 ends with 8. So, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence because starting from 4, every 10th number adds one. Wait, maybe it's better to calculate it as (488 + 1) // 10, which would be 48.9, so 48 times. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach. For the units place, the number of 4's is equal to the number of times 4 appears in the ones place from 1 to 488. The pattern repeats every 10 numbers, with one 4 each cycle. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is the number of complete groups of 10 in 488, which is 48, plus any extra numbers beyond that. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, there's no extra 4 in the units place beyond the 48th group. So, units place: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? The first block is 40-49, which is the first set where the tens digit is 4. Then, in the hundreds place, we can have 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's see: For the tens digit being 4, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 40-49), 1 (140-149), 2 (240-249), 3 (340-349), and 4 (440-449). But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. However, 40-49 is in the two-digit range, which is valid. So, how many such blocks are there? For each hundreds digit from 0 to 4, except when the hundreds digit is 4 and the tens digit is 4, we have to check if the upper limit (449) is within 488. 449 is less than 488, so all these blocks are valid. So, the number of blocks is 5 (hundreds digits 0,1,2,3,4). Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, when the hundreds digit is 4, the block is 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 50 numbers where the tens digit is 4. But wait, does the 488 limit affect this? No, because 449 is less than 488, so all 50 numbers are valid. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place, which would be pages 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4, so every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, does 488 count as an extra? 488 is the last page, so yes, it's included. So, the number of 8's in the units place is 49 (from 8 to 488, stepping by 10). Wait, let me check: starting at 8, the next is 18, ..., up to 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many full blocks and partial blocks there are. The hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. For each, the tens digit is 8. So, for hundreds digits 0,1,2,3, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10 numbers. But for hundreds digit 4, the block is 480-488, which is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 + 1 block \u00d7 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, tens place: 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times (from 4 to 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400 to 488, totaling 89 times.\n**Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (from 8 to 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

For units digit, the number of 4's is equal to the number of complete tens in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete tens. But each ten contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, the last number is 488, which is 48*10 + 8, so the units digit is 8, not 4. So, the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is 48*10 + 4. So, from 1 to 484, that's 48 occurrences, and then from 485 to 488, there are no more 4's in the units place. So, units place gives 48 4's. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, total blocks: 5. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 end at 449, which is less than 488, so that's fine. So, tens place contributes 50 4's. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete tens. But let's check the last number: 488 is included, so 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, no: 8,18,...,488. Let's see: The first is 8, then 18, ..., 488. How many terms? The sequence is 8 + 10k where k=0 to n, such that 8 + 10k \u2264 488. The maximum k is (488 - 8)/10 = 480/10=48. So, k=0 to 48, which is 49 terms. So, units place gives 49 8's. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that block. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see how many such blocks: From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), because 489 is beyond 488. So, the last block contributes 9 numbers. So, total blocks: 4 full blocks (each with 10) and one partial block with 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 8's. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=187. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. Difference=187-98=89. Hmm, that seems right. I think I did everything correctly.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 48 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 4 blocks \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as pages go up to 488.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Let me think again: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 fours. But then, in the incomplete group (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which is another 4. So total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, maybe I was right the first time. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but in the last range, 440-449, does that go up to 449? Since the book goes up to 488, 449 is within 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times this happens. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. That's 48 eights. But then, in the incomplete group (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included. So that's another 8, making it 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range. Let's count these ranges:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488)\n\nSo, for the first four ranges, each contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. The last range contributes 9 eights. So total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights here.\n\nAdding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. The ranges are:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers\n\nSo, that's 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So 4*10 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nNow, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the fours:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, step 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, right? So that's 5 ranges, each 10, so 50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. Correct.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Correct.\n\nEights:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,28,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10. Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So 4*10 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0. Correct.\n\nSo, 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for eights. Let me check again. The tens digit is 8 in the ranges:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers\n\nSo that's 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9, totaling 49. Correct.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place, the 8 doesn't appear because the book ends at 488. So, no hundreds place 8's. So, 98 eights in total.\n\nTherefore, the number of fours is 188, and eights are 98, so 188 - 98 = 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit '4' and '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** '4' appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens Place:** '4' appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range has 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** '4' appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** '8' appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens Place:** '8' appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four ranges have 10 each, and the last has 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No occurrence since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' appears 90 times more than the digit '8'.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: The number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488 is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 there are, which is floor(488/10) = 48, plus 1 if the last digit is 4. Since 488 ends with 8, the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449? Since 488 is the last page, 449 is within the range, so yes, that's valid. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. That's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). But wait, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 numbers. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Wait, let me add that again: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let me see: Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which contributes 9 numbers (480-488). So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total is 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place: 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Therefore, total number of 8's is 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) -98 (number of 8's)=90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's: Units: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Let me think again: The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is the last page with a 4 in the units place. So, 484 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 4, every 10 pages adds another. So, maybe it's 48 full tens, which would give 48, but since 484 is included, that's 49. Hmm, maybe I should think differently. For units place, the number of 4's is equal to the number of times 4 appears in the units digit from 1 to 488. So, in each set of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many sets of 10 are there in 488? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4. But wait, the last set is from 480 to 488, which includes 484, so that's another 4. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times 4 appears in the units place. Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, so 480-488 includes 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, counting the number of times 4 appears in the tens place. This happens in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid, but 540-549 would be beyond 488. So, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place). From 100-199: 140-149 (another 10). From 200-299: 240-249 (another 10). From 300-399: 340-349 (another 10). From 400-488: 440-449 (another 10). So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 5*10=50. Wait, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's valid. So, total 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, counting 4's in the hundreds place. This occurs in numbers from 400-488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8's appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with 8. So, how many 8's in the units place? Let's see, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8's in the tens place occur in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is valid. How many blocks? From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers? Wait, 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9. So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place, and the last block contributes 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. Wait, but wait, let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, total 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8's in the hundreds place. This would occur in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences (since 484 is the last such number).\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit):** The digit 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit):** The digit 4 appears in numbers 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit):** The digit 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. The first four blocks contribute 40, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit):** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 90 more times than the digit 8.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think of it as (488 // 10) if 488 is the last number. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 484 is within 488, maybe it's 49 times. Hmm, maybe I should calculate it as (488 + 1) // 10. That would be 489 // 10 = 48.9, which is 48, but that might not include the last partial set. Alternatively, maybe it's better to calculate how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488 and then see if the last set has a 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, which is 48. Then, since the remainder is 8, which is less than 10, the 48th set ends at 480, and the next set is 481-488. In this last set, 484 is present, so that's one more 4 in the units place. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: The first block is 40-49 (pages 40-49), the next is 140-149, then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does the last block go up to 449, and since the book goes up to 488, we don't have another block beyond 449. So, yes, 5 blocks, each with 10 4's in the tens place, so 50 4's.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nNow, let me add up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers. So, starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? Let's see: The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 8. But wait, the first set is 1-10, so 8 is in 8, then 18, etc. So, 488 // 10 = 48, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, no: 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So, 488 - 8 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 8's in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Each block contributes 10 8's in the tens place except the last one, which only goes up to 488, so 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place.\n- 180-189: 10 numbers, so another 10.\n- 280-289: 10 numbers, another 10.\n- 380-389: 10 numbers, another 10.\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, total 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let me double-check the tens place calculation. For the tens place, each block of 100 has a block where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89, that's 10 numbers. Then 180-189, another 10, and so on up to 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89 (1 block), 180-189 (2nd), 280-289 (3rd), 380-389 (4th), and 480-488 (5th). So, 5 blocks. The first four blocks each contribute 10 8's, and the fifth contributes 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, yes, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the units place had 49 8's, and the tens place 49, so total 98 8's. But let me confirm the units place again. Units place: 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The sequence starts at 8 and ends at 488, with a common difference of 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, yes, 49 units place 8's.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the 4's total was 188 and 8's were 98, so 188 - 98 = 90. But I'm not sure if I did that correctly. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, when I calculated the 4's in the units place, I thought it was 49, but let me check that again. Units place for 4's: 4,14,24,...,484. The last term is 484, which is less than 488. So, how many terms? (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 4's in units place.\n\nTens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 blocks *10=50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nSimilarly, 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When counting the 4's in the hundreds place, is it from 400 to 488 inclusive? Yes, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 is correct.\n\nFor the 8's, in the hundreds place, there are none, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. The blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. So, that's five blocks. The first four are complete, each with 10 8's, and the last block has 9 numbers (480-488). So, 4*10 +9=49, which is correct.\n\nUnits place: 49, tens place:49, so 98.\n\nSo, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the 8's in the tens place would be 50, but no, it's 49. Hmm. Let me see: from 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the 4's in the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is to calculate the number of 4's in each digit place separately.\n\nAnother approach: For each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), calculate how many times 4 appears.\n\nUnits place: For each page number from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of 4's in the units place is floor(488/10) + (1 if the remainder is >=4 else 0). Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. Since 8 >=4, we add 1, so 48 +1=49. That's correct.\n\nTens place: The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49). So, how many hundreds are there in 488? 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, in each of the first 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), there are 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, but wait, 401-488: the tens digit is 0-8. So, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, but in 401-488, the tens digit is 0 in 401-410, 1 in 411-420, etc., up to 8 in 480-488. Wait, no: 401-488 is part of the hundreds digit 4. Wait, actually, in the hundreds place, 400-488, the tens digit cycles as usual. So, for the tens digit being 4, it's 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10 numbers. So, total 5 blocks, each with 10 4's in the tens place, so 5*10=50.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 5 blocks, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 5 blocks, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place: Only from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,28,...,488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, so 48+1=49.\n\nTens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, the last has 9, so 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count any numbers. For example, is there any overlap where a page number has both a 4 and an 8? But since we're counting the number of digits, not the number of numbers, it's okay. Each digit is counted separately, so even if a number has both 4 and 8, each occurrence is counted.\n\nFor example, page 48 has a 4 in the tens place and an 8 in the units place. So, that contributes one 4 and one 8, which are both counted.\n\nSo, the total counts are correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so 188 -98=90.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of 4's: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 4's, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Number of 4's: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in page numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of 4's: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of 8's: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 8's each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Number of 8's: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since page numbers go up to 488.\n   - Number of 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think of it as for every 10 numbers, there's one 4 in the units place. So, up to page 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But then, the 49th group starts at 480, and goes to 489, but our book ends at 488, so we have 480, 481, ..., 488. So, in the units place, the 4 appears once at 484. So, total 48 times? Or 49? Hmm, maybe I should calculate it as floor(488/10) + 1 if the last number is included. Wait, maybe a better way is to think that for each ten, the units digit cycles 0-9. So, in each ten, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, 480-488 is the 49th ten, but in that ten, the units digits go from 0-8, so 484 is included, which is the 4 in the units place. So, that's one more, making it 49 times. So, the units place has 49 4's. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges exist up to 488. The first range is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 4's in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct, 5 ranges, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. Let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 8*61=488, but wait, 8*61=488? No, 8*60=480, plus 8 is 488. So, the number of terms is 488/10=48.8, but since we include the last term, it's 49. So, units place: 49 8's. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count how many such ranges are there up to 488. The first range is 80-89 (10 numbers), then 180-189 (another 10), 280-289 (another 10), 380-389 (another 10). That's 4 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40 8's in the tens place. Now, does 480-489 count? Yes, but since our book ends at 488, the range 480-488 has 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). But in the tens place, 480-488 has 8 in the tens place for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but in the tens place, 80-89, 180-189, etc., each have 10 numbers. However, in the case of 480-488, it's only 9 numbers. So, does that mean we have an extra 8 in the tens place? Wait, no, because 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, but in the tens place, the 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so that's an additional 9 8's in the tens place. Wait, but earlier I thought it's 4 ranges, but actually, 480-489 would be another range, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, does that mean we have 5 ranges? Let me think: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 5 ranges, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, the total 8's would be 4 full ranges (each 10 numbers) plus 9 numbers in the partial range. So, 4*10=40 plus 9=49. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me check: from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9, so in each hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 1-99, 80-89: 10 times. For 100-199, 180-189: 10 times. For 200-299, 280-289: 10 times. For 300-399, 380-389: 10 times. For 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total 10+10+10+10+9=49 times. So, tens place: 49 8's. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place: 0 8's. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me think again about the units place for 4's. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, correct, 49 times. Similarly, for 8's in the units place, it's 8,18,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 8*61=488. Wait, 8*61=488? Let me check: 8*60=480, plus 8=488. So, the number of terms is 61? Wait, no, because starting from 8, each step is 10. So, the nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 +10(n-1)=488. So, 10(n-1)=480, n-1=48, n=49. So, 49 terms, correct. So, units place for 8's is 49. For the tens place, 4's: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50 4's. Correct. For 8's in tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 ranges, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, 4 full ranges (40) plus 9, total 49. Correct. Hundreds place for 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct. So, total 4's: 49+50+89=188. 8's:49+49=98. Difference:188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Number of 4's: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\)\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   - Number of ranges: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449)  \n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, so total 4's: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\)\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.  \n   - Number of pages: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\)  \n   - Total 4's: 89\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\)\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Number of 8's: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\)\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   - Full ranges: 4 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing \\( 4 \\times 10 = 40 \\)  \n   - Partial range (480-488): 9 numbers  \n   - Total 8's: \\( 40 + 9 = 49 \\)\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.  \n   - Total 8's: 0\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\)\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = \\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should calculate it as (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me count how many sets of 100 there are. From 0-99, there's one set (40-49), from 100-199 another set (140-149), from 200-299 another (240-249), from 300-399 another (340-349), and from 400-488, the last set is 440-449. So that's 5 sets. Each set has 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, in the last set, 440-449, does 449 exceed 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers.\n\nNow, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count the sets. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that's 9 numbers instead of 10. So, total sets: 4 full sets (each with 10) and one partial set with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10th number, resulting in 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.

    "text": " Maybe I should think differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra numbers. So, up to 488, there are 48 full decades (1-480) and then 8 more numbers (481-488). So, in each full decade, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, from 1-480, that's 48 decades, so 48 times. Then, in 481-488, the units digit goes from 1-8, so no 4 in the units place. So, total 4's in units place: 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which is the second digit. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks exist up to 488. The first block is 40-49, which is within 1-488. The next is 140-149, then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. After that, the next would be 540-549, but 540 is beyond 488, so we stop at 440-449. So, how many blocks is that? Let's count: 40-49 is 1, 140-149 is 2, 240-249 is 3, 340-349 is 4, 440-449 is 5. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5*10=50. But wait, in the block 440-449, the tens digit is 4, but the units digit can be 0-9, so 10 numbers. However, the book ends at 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 488, so that's fine. So, total 4's in the tens place: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be numbers from 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there from 400-488? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. So, total 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98; 98+89=187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many terms? The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The difference between each term is 10, so it's an arithmetic sequence with first term 8, common difference 10, last term 488. The formula for the nth term is a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d. So, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10. 488 -8 = (n-1)*10 => 480 = (n-1)*10 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488. So, let's count the blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. That's 5 blocks. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480-488), but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, 4 blocks with 10 each, and 1 block with 9. Wait, no: in the tens place, for 480-488, the tens digit is 8, and the units digit ranges from 0-8. So, that's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them. So, each block contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except the last one, which contributes 9. Wait, no: actually, in each block, the tens digit is 8 for all 10 numbers, but in the last block, since it only goes up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, for the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributes 10 8's in the tens place. The last block, 480-488, contributes 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, but I feel like that might not be correct. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the 4's in the tens place. I said 5 blocks of 10, so 50. The blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5*10=50. That seems right. For the units place of 4's: from 4,14,...484. How many? 484 is the last one. So, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 48 full decades, but 484 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, earlier I thought it was 48, but actually, it's 49. Because 4 is the first, 14 is the second, ..., 484 is the 49th. So, I think I made a mistake here. So, units place for 4's should be 49, not 48. Let me correct that. So, units place: 49. Tens place:50. Hundreds place:89. Total 4's:49+50+89=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total 8's=98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, now I'm getting 90. But earlier I thought it was 89. So, where did I go wrong? Let me recount the units place for 4's. The numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 484=4 + (n-1)*10 => 480=(n-1)*10 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, 49 terms. So, units place for 4's is 49, not 48. So, total 4's=49+50+89=188. 8's=49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. But wait, let me check the tens place for 8's again. I said that in the tens place, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 8's, and the last block contributes 9 8's. So, 4*10 +9=49. That's correct. So, 49 in tens place for 8's, plus 49 in units place, total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the number of times the digits 4 and 8 appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, starting from 4 and ending at 484. This results in 49 occurrences (since 484 is the 49th term in the sequence 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, starting from 8 and ending at 488. This results in 49 occurrences (since 488 is the 49th term in the sequence 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8, so this contributes 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 90 times more than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think differently. For each set of 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9, so 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 fours. But wait, the last number is 488, which is in the 49th set (480-489). So, in the units place, 488 would contribute a 4 at 484, which is within 480-489. So, 48 complete sets give 48 fours, and then the 48th set ends at 480, so 484 is the next one, which is in the 49th set. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me calculate it as (488 // 10) + 1 if the last digit is >=4? No, that's not right. Alternatively, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of times the units digit cycles through 0-9 up to 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48 fours. But wait, the 48th cycle ends at 480, so the next number is 481, which is beyond, but 484 is within 480-489, so that's an additional 4 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49 fours in the units place. Hmm, I think that's correct. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This occurs in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there up to 488? Let's see: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. But wait, 440-449 is up to 449, and 488 is beyond that. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50 fours. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This occurs in the range 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours from units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, I need to count the number of 8's in the same way. Let's go through the same process. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, so 48 eights. But wait, the last number is 488, which has an 8 in the units place, so that would be the 49th occurrence. So, 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Each range contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Now, up to 488, how many such ranges are there? 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: since 488 is the last page, the range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, that's 5 ranges, but the last one only has 9 numbers instead of 10. So, for the tens place, the first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last one contributes 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. 8 is higher than 4, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights from units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Checking fours: Units: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. Total: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. Eights: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total:98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct, but I'm a bit unsure because I thought maybe I overcounted in the hundreds place for fours. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, that's correct. For eights, in the tens place, the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place, not 10. So, 4 ranges of 10 and one of 9, totaling 49. Units place: 488 is included, so 49 eights. So, 49+49=98. So, the difference is indeed 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers.

    "text": " Let me recount: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, the last cycle ends at 480, so the next 4 in the units place would be 484, which is within 488. So, that's 49 times. Wait, maybe I should calculate it as (488 - 4)/10 + 1. Let me see: (488 - 4) is 484, divided by 10 is 48.4, so 48 full tens, plus 1 for the starting point, which would be 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such ranges are there? From 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 full hundreds. Each hundred contributes one set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40. But wait, in the last hundred, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40. So, 40 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: from 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 40 = 89, plus 89 is 178. So, 178 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through each place again: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me count how many times. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these contributes 10 occurrences. How many such ranges are there? From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 ranges, each contributing 10, so 4\u00d710=40. But wait, does 480-488 include any 8 in the tens place? 480-489 would have 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, so the tens digit here is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, that's only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, in the hundreds place, the 4 is present, and the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. So, that's an additional 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, total tens place: 4 ranges \u00d710=40, plus 9=49. Wait, no, because 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, so the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 occurs in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book is 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 178 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 80. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For the 4's: units=49, tens=40, hundreds=89. Total=178. For the 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. 178-98=80. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Yes, that's correct. And for the 8's in the tens place, I had to include 480-488, which adds 9 more, making it 49 in the tens place. So, yes, 98 8's. So, the difference is 80. So, the answer should be 80 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, 484 is the last 4 in the units place, which is the 49th occurrence. So maybe I should calculate it as (488 + 1) // 10 = 48.9, which would be 48 times. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Maybe a better approach is to consider that in every block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block, 4 appears once in the units place. How many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, the last partial block from 481 to 488 includes 484, which is another 4 in the units place. So that would be 48 + 1 = 49 times. Okay, so 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers) From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers) From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers) From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers) Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This happens from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8. But 488 is included, so that's 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included. So, 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This happens in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. So, each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 10 numbers each. The last range, 480-488, contributes 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers. So yes, 4*10=40 +9=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. This would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers.

    "text": " Maybe I should calculate it as (488 // 10) + 1 if the last number is 484. Wait, no, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer division would be 48, but since 484 is less than 488, maybe it's 48 times. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place can be calculated by taking the total number of pages divided by 10, which is 488 / 10 = 48.8. Since we can't have a fraction, we take the floor, which is 48. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does 484 count as the 49th occurrence? Because from 4 to 484, that's 484 - 4 = 480, and 480 / 10 = 48, plus the first one, 4, making it 49. So maybe it's 49 times. Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe I should use a formula. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is floor((n + 10 - d) / 10). Let me try that. So for d=4, n=488: floor((488 + 10 - 4)/10) = floor(494/10) = 49. So 49 times in the units place. Similarly, for 8: floor((488 + 10 -8)/10) = floor(490/10) = 49. So 49 times in the units place for 8 as well. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does 488 count as an 8 in the units place? Yes, because 488 is page 488, so the units digit is 8. So, the count for 8 in units place is 49. So for 4, units place: 49, and for 8, units place: 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place. The digit 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 540-549 isn't. So how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see: Each hundred has a block where the tens digit is 4. So from 1-99: 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 times. From 100-199: 140-149: 10 times. From 200-299: 240-249: 10 times. From 300-399: 340-349: 10 times. From 400-488: 440-449: 10 times, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So total for 4 in tens place: 5 sets of 10, so 50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, but does 440-449 end at 449, which is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So 50 times for 4 in the tens place. Now for 8 in the tens place: Similarly, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So each hundred block before 400 has 10 occurrences, but the last one has only 9. So from 1-99: 80-89: 10. From 100-199: 180-189:10. From 200-299:280-289:10. From 300-399:380-389:10. From 400-488:480-488:9. So total for 8 in tens place: 4*10 +9=49 times. So 4 in tens place:50, 8 in tens place:49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. For 4, it appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. So how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1=89 numbers. So 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. For 8, does it appear in the hundreds place? The book goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. So 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So 0 times for 8 in hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences: For 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89)=49+50=99+89=188. For 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=49+49=98. So the number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me verify each part again. Units place for 4: floor((488 +10 -4)/10)=floor(494/10)=49. Correct. Units place for 8: floor((488 +10 -8)/10)=floor(490/10)=49. Correct. Tens place for 4: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5*10=50. Correct. Tens place for 8: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place for 4: 400-488 is 89 numbers. Correct. Hundreds place for 8: None, so 0. So total 4's:49+50+89=188. Total 8's:49+49+0=98. Difference:188-98=90.

Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many complete sets of 100 there are in 488. From 1-488, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. In each hundred, the tens place 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 40-49 in each hundred). So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40. But wait, the last hundred is 301-400, and then we have 401-488. In 401-488, the tens place 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers.

That's 4 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens place 4 occurs in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. That's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive).

Wait, that can't be right. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 4,14,...,484. That's 49 times. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll go through each digit position as well. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. From 1-488, how many such ranges are there? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 89. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 89. The difference is 188 - 89 = 99. Wait, that seems a bit high, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds: 89. Total 188. For 8's, units:49, tens:40, hundreds:0. Total 89. So, 188 - 89 = 99. So, there are 99 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. There are 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. There are 40 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** None, as pages go up to 488. 0 occurrences.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 40 + 0 = 89.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 89 (8's) = 99.\n\n$\\boxed{99}$"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place from 1 to N can be calculated by taking the floor of (N / 10) and adding 1 if the units digit is >= the target digit. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it as how many complete groups of 10 there are. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups of 10 (since 48*10=480), and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so no 4 in the units place. So total 4's in units place: 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (1 block) From 100-199: 140-149 (1 block) From 200-299: 240-249 (1 block) From 300-399: 340-349 (1 block) From 400-488: 440-449 (1 block, since 440-449 is within 400-488). So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Wait, but wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. So total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 48 times. Tens place: 5 blocks, each 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89. So 48+50=98, plus 89 is 187. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? From 1 to 488, the last number with 8 in units place is 488. So, 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 times? Wait, no. Let me think: the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So from 1-10: 8 once. 11-20: 18 once. ... 481-490: 488 once. But since the book ends at 488, the last group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers: 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So in this last group, the units digit 8 appears once at 488. So total number of 8's in units place: 48 (from 1-480) plus 1 (488) = 49. Wait, but 480 is included in the 48th group. So 480/10=48, so 48 times, but then 488 is an extra. So total 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 80-89 (1 block) From 100-199: 180-189 (1 block) From 200-299: 280-289 (1 block) From 300-399: 380-389 (1 block) From 400-488: 480-489, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, so in the hundreds place, 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-489, but since we go only up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, how many times does 8 appear? In each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributes 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, in 480-488, it's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. So total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: Units place: 48, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. Total: 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: Units place: 49, Tens place: 49, Hundreds place: 0. Total: 49+49=98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, but wait, when counting the tens place for 8's, I think I made a mistake. Let me check again. In the tens place, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), so 9. So total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49. That seems correct. Similarly, units place 8's: from 8,18,...,488. How many? 488/10=48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, and then the last partial decade has 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So units place 8's:49. So total 8's:49+49=98. 4's:187. So, 187-98=89. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: floor(488 / 10) = 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n   - Number of occurrences: 5 * 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 times.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: floor(488 / 10) + 1 (for 488) = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 numbers, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 numbers.\n   - Number of occurrences: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit 4 appears in 484, which is the 49th occurrence. Hmm, I'm confused now. Let me try another approach. For the units place, the number of times 4 appears is equal to the number of times the units digit cycles through 0-9 up to 488. Each cycle of 10 numbers contributes one 4. So, total cycles = floor(488 / 10) = 48. But wait, 488 is the last page, so in the 48th cycle, which is 480-489, but our book stops at 488. So, in the units place, from 1 to 488, how many 4's? It's 48 times because each complete set of 10 pages contributes one 4, and 488 is 48 full sets (since 488 / 10 = 48.8). Wait, but 488 is the 489th page if we start counting from 1. No, wait, 488 is the last page, so from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (each 10 pages) and then 8 more pages (481-488). So, in each full cycle of 10, there's one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, in the last partial cycle (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so no 4 in the units place. So, total 4's in units place: 48. Similarly, for the tens place: The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. How many such sets are there? From 1 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49). So, how many hundreds are there? 488 is less than 500, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Wait, no, 488 is in the 400-499 range, so actually, from 1-488, the hundreds are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers each. So, 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40. But wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, etc., but actually, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, 480-489. But our book ends at 488, so in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. Wait, but the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, ..., up to 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but we only go up to 488. So, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? In each hundred, 10 times, so from 1-400, it's 4 times (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), which is 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. Wait, that's 9 sets of 10 (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488). Wait, no, 400-409 is one set, 410-419 is another, up to 480-488. But 480-488 is only 9 numbers, but the tens digit is still 4 for all of them. So, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 9 sets of 10, but each set contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which is only 9. Wait, no, the tens digit is 4 for the entire range 400-488 when the tens digit is 4. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for the numbers 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, 480-488. That's 9 sets, each contributing 10 numbers except the last one, which is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but the tens digit is 4 for all these numbers, regardless of the units digit. So, in 400-409, tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. Similarly, 410-419: 10 numbers, and so on up to 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens digit 4's in 400-488 is 9 sets \u00d7 10 = 90? No, that can't be right because 400-488 is only 89 numbers. Wait, no, 400-488 is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But the tens digit is 4 for 9 sets: 400-409 (10 numbers), 410-419 (10), 420-429 (10), 430-439 (10), 440-449 (10), 450-459 (10), 460-469 (10), 470-479 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers). So, that's 8 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 8\u00d710 + 9 = 89 numbers, but the tens digit is 4 for all of them, so that's 89 times. Wait, but that can't be because in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 90 numbers, but we only have 89 numbers. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449, etc. So, from 1-488, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? Each hundred has a 40-49 range, so in 1-100, 40-49: 10 times. In 101-200, 140-149: 10 times. In 201-300, 240-249: 10 times. In 301-400, 340-349: 10 times. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449: 10 times, and 480-488: 9 times. Wait, but 401-488 includes 400-488, so I think I need to adjust. Wait, 400-488 is part of the 400-499 range, which would have 40-49 in each hundred, but since we're only going up to 488, let's see. From 1-488, the tens digit 4 appears in:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10\n- 240-249: 10\n- 340-349: 10\n- 440-449: 10\n- 480-488: 9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 4 for all of them)\n\nSo, total tens digit 4's: 4 sets \u00d7 10 + 1 set \u00d7 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but 400-488 includes 400-488, so the tens digit 4 appears in 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. That's 9 sets, each contributing 10 numbers except the last one which is 9. So, 8 sets \u00d7 10 + 1 set \u00d7 9 = 89. But that seems too high. Wait, no, because in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 400-409 (10), 410-419 (10), ..., up to 480-488 (9). So, that's 9 sets, each contributing 10 except the last which is 9. So, total tens digit 4's in 400-488: 8\u00d710 + 9 = 89. But that can't be right because 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but the tens digit 4 appears in each of those numbers except when the tens digit is something else. Wait, no, the tens digit is 4 for the entire 400-409, 410-419, etc., so in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 90 numbers (from 400-489), but since we only go up to 488, it's 89 numbers. So, the tens digit 4 appears 89 times in 400-488. But wait, that seems too high because the tens digit cycles every 100. Let me check another way. The number of times the tens digit is 4 from 1-488 is equal to the number of times the tens digit is 4 in each hundred. So, in 1-100: 10 times (40-49). In 101-200: 10 (140-149). In 201-300: 10 (240-249). In 301-400: 10 (340-349). In 401-488: the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449 (10) and 480-488 (9). So, total in 401-488: 10 + 9 = 19. So, total tens digit 4's: 4\u00d710 + 19 = 59. Wait, that makes more sense. So, total tens digit 4's: 59.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 49. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach. The total number of times the tens digit is 4 is equal to the number of complete groups of 100 multiplied by 10, plus any partial group. So, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete groups. Each complete group contributes 10 times the tens digit 4, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, in the partial group (400-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449 (10 numbers) and 480-488 (9 numbers). So, 10 + 9 = 19. Therefore, total tens digit 4's: 40 + 19 = 59.\n\nOkay, so units digit 4's: 48 (as calculated earlier). Tens digit 4's: 59. Now, what about the hundreds digit? The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's: units (48) + tens (59) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 59 = 107; 107 + 89 = 196. So, 196 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so in the last group (481-490), 488 is the 8 in the units place. So, total units digit 8's: 49. Because from 1-488, the units digit 8 appears 49 times (since 488 is included). Wait, let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The sequence is 8 + 10k, where k=0 to 48. So, k=0:8, k=48: 8 + 480=488. So, total 49 numbers. So, units digit 8's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them)\n\nSo, total tens digit 8's: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. From 1-488, the tens digit 8 appears in:\n\n- 80-89: 10\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nSo, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds digit 8's: 0.\n\nTherefore, total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens digit. From 1-488, the tens digit 8 appears in:\n\n- 80-89:10\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nSo, 4\u00d710 +9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the units digit 8's were 49, and tens digit 8's were 49, so total 98. Now, the 4's were 196, so the difference is 196 - 98 = 98. So, there are 98 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the counts again because I might have made a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 59\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal: 48+59=107; 107+89=196.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:196-98=98.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I counted the tens digit 4's correctly. Let me recount the tens digit 4's.\n\nFrom 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in:\n\n- 40-49:10\n- 140-149:10\n- 240-249:10\n- 340-349:10\n- 440-449:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nWait, that's 5 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 5\u00d710 +9=59. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, it's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 4\u00d710 +9=49.\n\nSo, the counts seem correct. Therefore, the difference is 196 - 98 = 98.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the units digit 4's. Let me recount that.\n\nUnits digit 4's: from 1-488, every 10 numbers has one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, and then in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so no 4. So, total units digit 4's:48.\n\nSimilarly, units digit 8's: from 1-488, every 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place, and 488 is included, so 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units digit 8's:49.\n\nSo, yes, units digit 4's:48, units digit 8's:49.\n\nTherefore, the total counts seem accurate, leading to 196 4's and 98 8's, with a difference of 98.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When counting the hundreds digit 4's, I considered 400-488 as 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. That seems correct because 488 - 400 +1 =89.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens digit 4's, I had 59, which is correct as per the breakdown.\n\nSo, I think the final answer is that there are 98 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds digit for 4's. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens digit 4's, I had 59, which comes from 4 sets of 10 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349) and then in 400-488, 440-449 (10) and 480-488 (9), totaling 4\u00d710 +10 +9=59.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is part of the 400-488 range, so that's included in the tens digit count. So, yes, 59 is correct.\n\nOkay, I think I've double-checked all the counts. So, the difference is 196 - 98 = 98.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 196, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 98.\n\n$\\boxed{98}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should think of it as (484 - 4)/10 + 1. So, (484 - 4) is 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 occurrences.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is 488. So, how many? Using the same method: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see: 80-89 is within 488, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 4 * 10 = 40. But wait, does 480-489 also have an 8 in the tens place? Yes, but 480-489 is within 488, so 480-488 is part of that range. So, that's another range, making it 5 ranges. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), but since we're looking for the tens digit being 8, it's from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, does that count as a full 10? Hmm, no, it's only 9. So, actually, the tens digit 8 in the hundreds place would be in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, maybe I should adjust. Let me think again: the tens digit 8 occurs in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, the first four ranges are complete (each 10 numbers), and the last is 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but earlier I thought 4 ranges, but now it's 5. Let me check: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 full ranges and one partial. So, total is 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units was 49 and tens was 40, but now I'm getting tens as 49. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, when I was counting the units place for 8, I had 49, which seems correct because from 8 to 488, every 10 numbers, so 49 times.\n\nFor the tens place, I initially thought 4 ranges of 10, but actually, it's 5 ranges, with the last one being partial. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units was 49 and tens was 40, but that was a mistake. I corrected it to 49. So, 98 total 8's.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's. Let me recount:\n\n4's in units place: from 4, 14, ..., 484. That's (484 - 4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49.\n\n4's in tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 ranges, 5*10=50.\n\n4's in hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, as 488 - 400 +1=89.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188. That's correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49.\n\nTens: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds: 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm getting 90 as the difference. But let me check again because sometimes when counting, especially in the tens place, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nWait, for the 8's in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, that's correct. So, 4 full ranges (80-89, etc.) each 10, and one partial range with 9, so 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 in tens place.\n\nUnits:49, tens:49, total 98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if I missed something. Let me think about the hundreds place for 8's again. Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so 0 is correct.\n\nAnother way to check: maybe I can calculate the total number of digits and see if the counts make sense, but that might be overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each position again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a formula for digit counting.\n\nIn general, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N can be calculated as:\n\nunits = (N // 10) * 1 + min(max(N % 10 - d + 1, 0), 10)\n\nWait, maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, for units digit, it's floor((N + 1)/10) if d is 0, else floor((N + 1)/10) if the digit is non-zero. Wait, no, perhaps a better way.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to stick with the initial counting method, as I did before.\n\nWait, let me try for 4's:\n\nUnits place: 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1=48.4, which is 48 full steps, so 49 terms.\n\nTens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 ranges, each 10, so 50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488:89.\n\nTotal:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits:8,18,...,488: ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10 +1=49.\n\nTens:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds:0.\n\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, especially in the tens place for 8's, I might have missed a range or overcounted. Let me list out the ranges for 8's in the tens place:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nThat's 5 ranges, totaling 49. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place:\n\n- 40-49:10\n- 140-149:10\n- 240-249:10\n- 340-349:10\n- 440-449:10\n\nThat's 5 ranges, 50 numbers.\n\nSo, I think my count is correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so 188 - 98 = 90 more 4's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers is calculated by examining each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately. Similarly, the number of times the digit 8 appears is counted. \n\n- **For 4's:**\n  - Units place: 49 occurrences\n  - Tens place: 50 occurrences\n  - Hundreds place: 89 occurrences\n  - Total: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n- **For 8's:**\n  - Units place: 49 occurrences\n  - Tens place: 49 occurrences\n  - Hundreds place: 0 occurrences\n  - Total: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nSubtracting the number of 8's from the number of 4's gives the difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think differently. For each set of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete sets of 10 in 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, meaning 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last set is from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, does that mean the units digit 4 appears 48 times? Or 49? Wait, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (each 10 numbers), giving 48 fours, and then in the last partial set (480-488), the units digit 4 appears once at 484. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, so 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This occurs in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers long, so each contributes 10 fours in the tens place. How many such ranges are there up to 488? Let's see: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This occurs in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. But wait, does 488 count as an 8 in the units place? Yes, because 488 ends with an 8. So, the number of 8's in the units place is 48 (from 8 to 478) plus 1 (488), totaling 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 eights in the tens place. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488 for 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. This would occur in numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights here.\n\nAdding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49 (from 4, 14, ..., 484)\n- Tens place: 50 (from 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449)\n- Hundreds place: 89 (400-488)\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49 (8, 18, ..., 488)\n- Tens place: 49 (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488)\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of 10, contributing 48 fours, plus one more at 484, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10 fours. There are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), totaling 50 fours.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in numbers 400-488, contributing 89 fours.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of 10, contributing 48 eights, plus one at 488, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. The first four ranges contribute 40 eights, and the last range (480-488) contributes 9, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think of it as the number of times 4 appears in the units place up to 488. So, for each ten numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, how many tens are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, and then an extra 8 numbers. So, in each of the 48 full tens, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48. Then, in the last partial ten (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is within this range, so that's one more 4. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 ranges. Each range contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's fine. So total tens place 4's: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. Each number here has a 4 in the hundreds place. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 4's: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, and then an extra 8 numbers. In each full ten, there's one 8 in the units place, so 48. Then, in the last partial ten (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 is included, which is one more 8. So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that range. Let's count how many full ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89 is one range, contributing 10 8's. From 100-199: 180-189 is another, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, for the tens place, we have four full ranges (each contributing 10) and one partial range contributing 9. So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) is 10 numbers each, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 more. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, I think that's correct. Wait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 480-488, that's 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. That's correct. Similarly, for 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. So, the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full tens (480 numbers) contributing 48 occurrences, plus one more in 484. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges (including 440-449), each contributing 10 occurrences. Total: 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, there are 89 numbers with 4 in the hundreds place. Total: 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full tens contributing 48 occurrences, plus one more in 488. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full ranges contributing 40 occurrences, plus 9 more in 480-488. Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488. Total: 0.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think of it as for each group of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That would be 48 fours. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. 488 has an 8 in the units place, not a 4. So, the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 49th occurrence because 484 is 48*10 + 4, so 48 full tens plus one more. So, maybe it's 49 fours in the units place. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number by 10 and taking the integer part, then adding 1 if the digit is less than or equal to the units digit of the total number. Wait, maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, for the units place, the number of 4's is equal to how many times 4 appears in the ones place from 1 to 488. Each ten has one 4 in the units place, so from 1 to 488, there are 48 full tens (1-480) and then 481-488. In the 48 full tens, that's 48 fours. Then, in 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so there's one more 4 at 484. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, that makes sense.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, since the book goes up to 488, the last range is 440-449, which is within 488. So, how many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers)\nFrom 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers)\nFrom 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers)\nFrom 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers)\nFrom 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers)\nSo that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 5*10=50 fours.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's valid. So, total tens place 4's: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours.\n\nNow, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for 8's.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, but for 8's. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Each ten has one 8 in the units place: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me check how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8. Then, in 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which is another 8 in the units place. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8. This occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last one which contributes 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, how many ranges are there?\n\nFrom 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers)\nFrom 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers)\nFrom 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers)\nFrom 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers)\nFrom 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers)\nSo, that's 4 full ranges with 10 numbers each and one range with 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: (4*10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 hundreds place 8's.\n\nNow, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, so number of 4's is 188 and number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. But let me verify the tens place for 4's. I counted 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50. The ranges are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Yes, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 50 is correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, I had 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each with 10 numbers, and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place for both 4 and 8: 49 each. That seems right because each digit appears once every 10 numbers, and 488 is the last page, which includes one more occurrence for both.\n\nHundreds place: 4's are from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. 8's have none because the book doesn't go beyond 488.\n\nSo, yes, 188 fours and 98 eights. The difference is 90 fours more than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4, and one additional 4 in 484. Total: 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges, each contributing 10 fours. Total: 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Total: 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8, and one additional 8 in 488. Total: 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full ranges contributing 10 eights each, and one partial range 480-488 contributing 9 eights. Total: 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No numbers in 1-488 have 8 in the hundreds place. Total: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
