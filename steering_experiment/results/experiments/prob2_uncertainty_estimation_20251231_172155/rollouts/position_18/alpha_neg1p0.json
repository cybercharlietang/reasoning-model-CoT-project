    "text": " So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 484 is included, that's 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is the last one with a 4 in the units place. So, from 0 to 484, that's 485 numbers, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, the number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place, plus the 484, which is the 49th. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The 4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: The first block is 40-49 (pages 40-49), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's, so 5*10=50. But wait, does the last block go up to 449? Since the book goes up to 488, 449 is within that range, so yes, 5 blocks. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, 488 is included. So, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, let me check that again. Units: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, plus the 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. So, how many blocks? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except the last one, which only goes up to 488, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, no: 480-488 is 9 numbers (including both 480 and 488). So, for the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributes 10 8's, so 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, contributes 9 8's in the tens place (since 480 has 8 in tens, 481, ..., 488). So, total 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place from page 800 onwards, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, let me verify. Units: 49, Tens: 49, so 49+49=98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, did I do that right? Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: Units: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: Units: 49, Tens: 49. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yes, that seems right. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488).\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = **188**.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, 484 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within 488. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place, the 4 can appear in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 0-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48 occurrences. But wait, 488 is included, so that's actually 49 occurrences because from 0-488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place, and 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me confirm: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last block. Let's count the blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks, but the last block only has 9 numbers (480-488). So, for the first four blocks, each contributes 10 occurrences, and the last block contributes 9. So, total in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that can't be right because 188 - 98 is 90, but I think I made a mistake somewhere. Let me double-check the counts. For 4's: Units place: 49, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. Total: 188. For 8's: Units place: 49, Tens place: 49, Hundreds place: 0. Total: 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I feel like that might not be accurate because in the hundreds place for 4's, it's 89, which seems high. Let me check that again. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. Yes, that's correct. For the tens place of 4's, from 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Units place: 49. So, 188 total 4's. For 8's: Units place: 49, Tens place: 49. So, 98 total 8's. Therefore, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I overcounted the 4's in the units place. Let me recount the units place for 4's. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? The first is 4, then every 10 numbers. So, 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49. That's correct. Similarly, for 8's in units place, it's 49. So, that's correct. Tens place for 4's: 50, which is correct because 5 blocks of 10. Tens place for 8's: 49, because the last block is only 9 numbers. So, 49. So, the difference is indeed 90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because 488 is the last page, so when counting the tens place for 8's, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, making 49. So, yes, 49. Therefore, the total 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4 to 484, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8 to 488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place within 488.\n   \nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, in the units place, there are 49 occurrences of 4. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 1 to 488, the tens place 4 occurs in 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 occurrences. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 0, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 1 to 488, the tens place 8 occurs in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40 occurrences. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (40) = 89. Now, subtracting the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 89 (eights) = 99.

    "text": " So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, but since 488 is the last page, the units place 4's go up to 484, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place can be calculated by (n // 10) + 1 if the digit is 0, but for other digits, it's (n // 10) where n is the last number. Wait, no, actually, for each complete set of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, the last set is from 480 to 488, which includes 484 as the 49th occurrence. So, actually, it's 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, units place 4's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one range, contributing 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (400-488 inclusive), but each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is included, so how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place 8's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see: From 1-99: 80-89, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, 10. From 200-299: 280-289, 10. From 300-399: 380-389, 10. From 400-488: 480-489, but 489 is beyond 488, so only up to 488. So, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the hundreds place 400-488, the tens place 8's are only 9 numbers. So total tens place 8's: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, etc.) plus 9 in the last range. So 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 400-488, the tens place 8's are in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers (from 480 to 488 inclusive). So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, correct. So, tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Units place 8's: 488 is included, so 49 times. Correct. So, 98 total 8's. 4's: 188. So, difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 times. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, right? So, 10 times. So, 5 sets, each with 10, so 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers are there from 400-488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last occurrence is at 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's calculate each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers, 10 times. - 180-189: 10 numbers, 10 times. - 280-289: 10 numbers, 10 times. - 380-389: 10 numbers, 10 times. - 480-488: Here, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 times. So, total for tens place: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that can't be right because 188-98 is 90, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. Now, 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 4's. Wait, when I counted the tens place for 4's, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets of 10, so 50 times. That seems correct. For the 8's in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49. That seems correct. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be different, but maybe it's correct. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should approach this by considering each digit position separately and using a formula. For the units place, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to n is floor(n/10) + 1 if the units digit is >=d. Wait, no, more accurately, it's (n // 10) + 1 if the units digit of n is >=d, else n//10. Wait, maybe it's better to think of it as for each digit place, how many times does the digit d appear. For units place: For each complete set of 10 numbers, the digit d appears once in the units place. So, for n=488, the number of times 4 appears in units place is (488 // 10) + 1 if 488 % 10 >=4. 488//10=48, 488%10=8, which is >=4, so 48+1=49 times. Similarly, for 8 in units place: 488//10=48, 488%10=8 >=8, so 48+1=49 times. That matches my earlier count. For the tens place: For each digit d, the number of times it appears in the tens place is calculated by considering each hundred. For example, for d=4, in each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9, so in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, up to 488, how many hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 is part of the 400-499 hundred, but we only go up to 488. So, for the tens place, for d=4: in each hundred, 10 times. So, up to 399, that's 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40 times. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last number). So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 0 (400-409), 1 (410-419), ..., 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, which is 9 possibilities. But we're looking for when the tens digit is 4. So, in 400-488, how many times does the tens digit equal 4? It's the numbers 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 times. So, total for tens place: 4*10 (from 0-399) +10 (from 400-488) =50 times. That's the same as before. Similarly, for d=8 in the tens place: up to 399, we have 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, 40+9=49 times. That's correct. For the hundreds place: For d=4, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89 times. For d=8, the hundreds digit is 8 only from 800-899, but since we're only going up to 488, there are 0 times. So, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) =188. Total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Difference:188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, it's easy to make off-by-one errors. Let me verify with smaller numbers to see if my method works. For example, let's say a book has 20 pages. How many 4's and 8's? Page numbers 1-20. Units place: 4 appears at 4,14 \u2192 2 times. 8 appears at 8,18 \u2192 2 times. Tens place: 4 appears in 40-49, but we only go up to 20, so 0 times. 8 appears in 80-89, which is beyond 20, so 0 times. Hundreds place: 0 for both. So, total 4's:2, 8's:2. Difference:0. Now, using my method: units place for 4: floor(20/10)=2, since 20%10=0, which is <4, so units=2. Tens=0. Hundreds=0. Total 4's=2. For 8's: units=2 (8,18), tens=0, hundreds=0. So, difference 0. Correct. Another test: 50 pages. Units place for 4: floor(50/10)=5, and 50%10=0 <4, so units=5? Wait, no, because 4,14,24,34,44 \u21925 times. Wait, but 50//10=5, and 50%10=0 <4, so units=5. 8's: units= floor(50/10)=5, and 50%10=0 <8, so units=5 (8,18,28,38,48). Tens place for 4: in 40-49, which is 10 numbers, but up to 50, it's 40-49, so 10 times. So, total 4's: units(5)+tens(10)=15. 8's: units(5)+tens(0)=5. Difference:10. Let me count manually: 4,14,24,34,44 (5), and 40-49:10, so total 15. 8's:8,18,28,38,48 (5). So, difference 10. Correct. So, my method seems to work. Therefore, returning to the original problem, the difference is 90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit '4':**\n1. **Units place:** The digit '4' appears once every 10 numbers.

    "text": " So, that's 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is the last page with a 4 in the units place. So, from 0 to 484, inclusive, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? It's (484 / 10) + 1 = 48.4 + 1, but since we can't have a fraction, it's 49. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, but the last partial decade (480-488) also has one 4 at 484. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10. From 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10. From 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10. From 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 5\u00d710=50. But wait, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, total tens place 4's: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, let me check that again. Units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 4's. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. Let's count how many such numbers. From 0 to 488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place? It's (488 / 10) + 1. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and the last partial decade (480-488) has 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place 8's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place for 8's. The 8 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89 \u219210. From 100-199:180-189\u219210. From 200-299:280-289\u219210. From 300-399:380-389\u219210. From 400-488: does 480-489 fall within 488? 480-488 is within 400-488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8, so from 480 to 489, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the hundreds place 4, the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times, not 10. So, that's 4 full decades (0-399) contributing 4\u00d710=40, and the last partial decade (400-488) contributing 9. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place for 8's. The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Wait, that can't be right because when I count the units and tens, I might have double-counted some numbers where both units and tens are 8, but no, because we're counting digits, not numbers. Each occurrence is a separate digit. So, the total 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Wait, but let me check again. For units place, it's 49, and for tens place, it's 49, so total 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me recount the 4's and 8's.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: from 4,14,...,484. The last 4 in units is 484, which is the 49th occurrence because (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these contributes 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89= 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,...,488. The last one is 488, so (488-8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers (since 488-480=8, but inclusive, so 9). So, for tens place, 4 full decades (0-399) each contributing 10, so 4\u00d710=40, and the last partial decade (400-488) contributing 9, so total 40+9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 +49 +0=98.\n\nSo, difference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I thought about the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, but does that include 488? Let me check: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers, yes. So, 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place in the last partial decade.\n\nSo, 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98 8's.\n\nThus, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot. Let me think differently. Maybe I should consider each digit position separately and ensure I'm not missing anything.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a formula or a more systematic approach.\n\nFor counting digits, the formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is floor(N/10) + (1 if d <= N%10 else 0). Similarly, for the tens place, it's floor((N/100)*10) + adjustment based on the remainder. But perhaps that's complicating things.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of each digit position:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: as before, 49.\n\n- Tens: 50.\n\n- Hundreds:89.\n\nTotal:188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:49.\n\n- Tens:49.\n\n- Hundreds:0.\n\nTotal:98.\n\nDifference:90.\n\nWait, but let me check for 8's in the tens place again. From 80-89:10 numbers. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, 4\u00d710 +9=49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think the difference is indeed 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 -400 +1=89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, final answer: 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because when I first thought about the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, but maybe I should think of it as 10 numbers if 480-489 were included, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 9. So, that part is correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough. So, the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four ranges contributes 10 numbers, and the last contributes 9.\n   - Total: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No pages have 8 in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**\n\\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since 488 is the last page, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, 40-49 is the first block, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 would go up to 449, and the book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is still within 488. Let's count these blocks: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: 10, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, 440-449: 10. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, and the book ends at 488, so 440-449 is entirely within the book. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Wait, but each of these numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, 8, 18, ..., 488. Let me check: 488 is 48*10 + 8, so yes, 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be the next block, but the book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many blocks: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 is the first, then 481, ..., up to 488, which is 9 numbers). So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the book.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as the book ends at 488.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, that's 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, there's a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me see how many hundreds there are. The book goes up to 488, so we have 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, but the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. So, let's count the number of times the tens digit is 4. In 1-99: 40-49, which is 10 numbers. In 100-199: 140-149, another 10. In 200-299: 240-249, another 10. In 300-399: 340-349, another 10. In 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers because 440 to 449 is 10 numbers. Wait, but 488 is less than 499, so does 440-449 fit within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's 10 numbers. So, adding them up: 10 (from 1-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but we have to check if 488 is included. Since 488 is the last page, yes, it's included. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, that's 49 numbers. Wait, let me confirm: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which is 480-488. Let's count each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total for tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0. Adding up all the 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 numbers.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as there are no page numbers from 800-899.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens place cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, there's one range where the tens digit is 4. How many hundreds are there? From 0 to 488, that's 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but in the last hundred, 400-488, the tens digit can only go up to 8, so the range 440-449 is still within 488, right? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, each hundred contributes 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. So, 5 hundreds times 10 numbers each is 50. But wait, let me check the last hundred: 400-488. The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, total 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but including 488, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is a three-digit number, so in the units place, from 0-488, how many times does 8 appear? Let's think: for each ten, starting from 0-9, 10-19, etc., the units digit cycles 0-9. So, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete tens. From 0-480, that's 48 tens, so 48 times. Then, in 481-488, the units digit is 8 once (488). So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in each hundred, there's one range where the tens digit is 8. So, 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so that's 9 numbers. So, in the hundreds 0-399, each contributes 10 numbers, so 4 hundreds times 10 is 40. Then, in 400-488, it's 9 numbers. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. Therefore, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems right. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I feel like that might not be accurate. Let me think again about the units and tens places. Wait, when counting the units place for 4's, I had 484 as the last number, which is 484. So, from 0 to 484, how many 4's in the units place? It's (484 + 1) / 10, which is 48.4, so 48 full times, but since 484 is the 49th occurrence, I think I was correct in counting 49. Similarly, for 8's in the units place, 488 is the last number, so (488 + 1)/10 = 48.9, so 48 full times, plus 1 for 488, making 49. That seems correct. For the tens place of 4's, each hundred from 0-400 has a 4 in the tens place for 10 numbers, so 400-488 would have 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 5 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 50. That's correct. For 8's in the tens place, each hundred from 0-300 has 10 numbers, and 400-488 has 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 4*10 + 9 = 49. Correct. Hundreds place for 4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct. Hundreds place for 8's: none, since the book ends at 488. So, 0. So, total 4's: 188, 8's: 98, difference 90. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check that again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers is that? It's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. So, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. For 8's, units: 49, tens: 49, hundreds: 0, total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences (4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = **188**.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences (8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place, so 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, that's 49 times. Wait, no, actually, from 1 to 488, the units place cycles every 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full cycles and then 8 extra numbers. Each cycle contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But then, in the last partial cycle from 480 to 488, the units digits go from 0 to 8, so the 484 is included, which is the 49th occurrence. So, actually, it's 49 times. Hmm, maybe I should use a formula. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to number N is given by floor((N + 1)/10). So, for N=488, floor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10) = 48.9, which floors to 48. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier thought. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me list them: from 1-10: 4 appears once (4). 11-20: 14. 21-30:24. ... 481-490:484. But since the book ends at 488, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is within 480-488. So, how many such numbers? From 0 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (0-480) and then 481-488. So, in 0-480, there are 48*1=48 times. Then, in 481-488, 484 is the only one, so total 49. So, I think the correct count is 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, so 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 would be in 400-488, right? So, how many ranges? 40-49: 10 numbers. 140-149:10. 240-249:10. 340-349:10. 440-449:10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, does 440-449 fit within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds digit, so that's 89 times. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, inclusive. So, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (0-480) and then 481-488. So, in 0-480, 48 times. In 481-488, 488 is included, which is the 48th occurrence. Wait, no: 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8 appears once every 10 numbers. Let me use the formula again: floor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10)=48.9, so 48 times. Wait, but 488 is included, so actually, it's 49 times. Let me list: 8,18,...,488. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place:49. 2. **Tens place:** 8's in the tens place occur in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each range contributes 10 numbers. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99:80-89:10 numbers. 100-199:180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488. So, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, so in the hundreds place, 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, but for the tens place, 480-489 would have 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, let me recast: For the tens place, the ranges are: 80-89:10 numbers. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's:10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's:98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (from 4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, totaling 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (from 8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last range being 480-488 (9 numbers), totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as there are no pages 800-899.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. But wait, the last range, 440-449, is within 400-488, so that's okay. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, does 488 count? Let me check: 488 is the last page, so yes. So, how many numbers? From 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 0-488 includes 49 numbers ending with 8. Wait, let me list them: 8,18,28,...,488. The first is 8 (which is 8\u00d71), and the last is 488 (which is 8\u00d761). Wait, 8\u00d761=488, so that's 61 numbers. Wait, but that can't be right because 8\u00d71=8, 8\u00d72=16, up to 8\u00d761=488. So, that's 61 numbers. Wait, but 488 is page 488, so the units digit 8 appears 61 times? Hmm, that seems high. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so from 1-488, there are 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 times. Wait, but 8\u00d71=8, 8\u00d72=16, up to 8\u00d761=488, which is 61 times. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The number of times 8 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, plus one more for the 488. So, 48 +1=49 times. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers (since 488-480+1=9). Wait, no: 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers? Wait, 480 is the first, then 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, for 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens place contributions are: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total: 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place: 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 188 - 98 = 90. \n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, that's 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0 to 488, there are 5 blocks of 100: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. But in the 400-488 block, the tens place goes up to 48, so the 4 in the tens place occurs from 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the last block is 400-488. Wait, no, actually, each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. So, 0-99: 10 numbers (40-49). 100-199: 10 numbers (140-149). Similarly, 200-299: 140-149? Wait, no, 200-299 would have 240-249. Hmm, I think I made a mistake here. Let me correct that. For each block of 100, the tens digit cycles from 0-9, so in each block, the tens digit is 4 exactly 10 times. So, from 0-99: 10 times. 100-199: another 10 times. 200-299: another 10 times. 300-399: another 10 times. 400-488: now, in this block, the tens digit goes up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. Wait, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? From 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409 (10 numbers), 410-419 (another 10), ..., up to 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, how many full decades are there? Let's see: 400-409: 10 numbers. 410-419: 10. 420-429:10. 430-439:10. 440-449:10. 450-459:10. 460-469:10. 470-479:10. 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 8 full decades (each contributing 10) and one partial decade (9). So, 8*10 +9=89? Wait, no, that can't be right because 400-488 is only 89 numbers. Wait, but we're counting the tens digit. Let me think differently. The tens digit is 4 for the range 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers except the last one, which has 9. So, how many such ranges are there? From 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 4, it's from 400-409 (10 numbers), 410-419 (another 10), ..., 480-488 (9 numbers). Wait, no, the tens digit is 4 when the tens place is 4, regardless of the hundreds digit. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for the numbers 404-409? No, wait, that's not right. Wait, no, the tens digit is 4 for any number where the second digit is 4, regardless of the hundreds digit. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. Wait, but 400-409 is 10 numbers, 410-419 is another 10, and so on up to 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many full decades are there? Let's see: 400-409: 10 numbers. 410-419:10. 420-429:10. 430-439:10. 440-449:10. 450-459:10. 460-469:10. 470-479:10. 480-488:9. So, that's 8 full decades (each with 10) and one partial decade (9). So, total in 400-488 is 8*10 +9=89? Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so that would mean that the tens digit is 4 in 89 numbers? That doesn't make sense because the tens digit cycles every 10. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach. The number of times the tens digit is 4 in the entire range 1-488 can be calculated as follows: For each hundred block, the tens digit cycles 0-9, so in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 exactly 10 times. So, from 0-99: 10 times. 100-199:10 times. 200-299:10 times. 300-399:10 times. 400-488: Now, in this block, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last number). So, the tens digit is 4 for numbers 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. Each of these is a full decade except the last one. So, how many full decades are there? From 400-488, the tens digit cycles 0-8, so the tens digit is 4 once, right? Because 400-409 is one set where the tens digit is 4. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, in 400-488, the tens digit can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, the tens digit is 4 for the range 400-409, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 400-409 is 10 numbers, but 488 is the last page, so 400-409 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. Then, the next set would be 410-419, which is another 10, and so on up to 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but 400-488 includes 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, how many times does the tens digit 4 occur? Let's see: 400-409:10 numbers. 410-419:10. 420-429:10. 430-439:10. 440-449:10. 450-459:10. 460-469:10. 470-479:10. 480-488:9. So, that's 8 full decades (each 10) and one partial decade (9). So, total in 400-488 is 8*10 +9=89? Wait, but that can't be because 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so the tens digit is 4 in 89 numbers? That doesn't make sense because the tens digit cycles every 10. Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of it differently. The number of times the tens digit is 4 in the entire range 1-488 is equal to the number of hundreds blocks times 10, plus any extra in the last partial block. There are 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 times the tens digit 4. So, 4*10=40. Then, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit is 4 for numbers 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. How many full decades are there here? From 400-488, the tens digit cycles 0-8, so the tens digit 4 occurs once, which is 400-409, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 488 is less than 490, so 400-409 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (400-409). So, total tens digit 4's: 4*10 +10=50. Wait, but earlier I thought the last block had 8 full decades, but that was a mistake. Actually, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit can only go up to 8, so the tens digit 4 occurs once, which is 400-409, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens digit 4's: 5 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the last block contributes 10 as well, because 400-409 is within 488. So, total tens digit 4's: 5*10=50. Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so 400-409 is 10 numbers, but 410-419 would be 410-419, which is also within 488, so that's another 10, and so on up to 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, no, the tens digit is 4 only when the tens place is 4, regardless of the hundreds place. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 400-409. Similarly, in 410-419, the tens digit is 1, so that's not 4. Wait, no, the tens digit is 4 only when the second digit is 4. So, in 400-488, the numbers where the tens digit is 4 are 404-409? No, that's not right. Wait, no, the tens digit is the second digit. So, in 400-409, the tens digit is 0 for 400-409, right? Wait, no, 400 is 4-0-0, so the tens digit is 0. 401 is 4-0-1, so tens digit 0. 404 is 4-0-4, tens digit 0. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: the tens digit is the second digit from the right. So, in 400, the digits are 4 (hundreds), 0 (tens), 0 (units). So, the tens digit is 0. Similarly, 401 has tens digit 0. 404 has tens digit 0. 409 has tens digit 0. Then, 410 has tens digit 1. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only when the number is like x4y, where x is 4, and y is 0-9. So, the numbers would be 440-449. Wait, that's in the 400-488 block. So, 440-449 is 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 440-449. So, that's 10 numbers. So, total tens digit 4's: in 0-99:10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:10. So, total 5*10=50. Okay, that makes sense. So, tens place contributes 50 4's. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, total hundreds place 4's:89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's:188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, last is 488. So, from 0-488, how many numbers have 8 in units place? It's the same as the number of times 8 appears in units place, which is (488 //10) +1 if 488 mod10 >=8. Wait, 488//10=48, and 488 mod10=8, which is equal to 8, so we add 1. So, total units place 8's:48+1=49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place for numbers like x8y, where x is 0-4 and y is 0-9. So, in each hundred block, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers. So, from 0-99: 80-89:10 numbers. 100-199:180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total tens place 8's:4 blocks of 10 (from 0-399) +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's:0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=49+49=98. So, total 8's:98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me verify the 4's again: units place:49, tens place:50, hundreds place:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds place:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again about the tens place for 4's. Earlier, I thought that in the 400-488 block, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (440-449). But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, in each hundred block, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, and there are 5 hundred blocks (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). So, 5*10=50. That seems correct. Similarly, for 8's, in the tens place, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4 blocks of 10 (from 0-399) plus 9, totaling 49. That seems correct. So, I think my final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '4' appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, this occurs 49 times (4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '4' appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred (e.g., 40-49, 140-149). There are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), contributing 10 each, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is '4' for 89 numbers.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '8' appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, this occurs 49 times (8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '8' appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred (e.g., 80-89, 180-189). There are 4 full blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), contributing 10 each, and 9 numbers in the 400-488 block (480-488), totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers with '8' in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - **Difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.  \nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since 484 is the last one, that's 49 times. Wait, actually, 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range. So, from 0 to 484, that's 485 numbers? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think differently. The number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, the last group would be from 480 to 488, which includes 484 as the 49th occurrence. So, maybe it's 49 times. I think the correct way is to calculate the number of times 4 appears in the units place as the integer division of 488 by 10, which is 48, plus one if the last page is beyond 484. Wait, 488 is beyond 484, so 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, the units place contributes 49 4's. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 would be within 440-488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This would be for page numbers from 400-488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's are 188. Wait, let me double-check that. Units: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is indeed 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place separately. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So, how many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is 488/10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But 488 is the 49th occurrence because 0-488 includes 489 numbers, but we're only up to 488. Wait, no. Let me think: from 0 to 488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place? It's the same as the number of times 8 appears in the units place, which is floor(488/10) + 1 if the last number is 488. Since 488 is included, the number of 8's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, no. Wait, 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8? Wait, no, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full times, and then the 48th occurrence is at 480, and 488 is the next one, which would be the 49th. So, yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89 is one range. From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, normally, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 8's, and the last range (480-488) contributes 9 8's. So, total 8's in the tens place: 4 x 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, counting 4's: units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. The number of such numbers is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place: 49. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges (from 0-99 to 400-488). So, 5 x 10 = 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89. Total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now for 8's: units place: 8,18,28,...,488. The number of such numbers is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. The first four ranges each have 10 numbers, the last has 9. So, 4x10 +9=49. Hundreds place: 0. Total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188 -98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't count any overlaps or miss any numbers. For example, in the tens place for 4's, 440-449: each of these has a 4 in the tens place, but also, 444 has two 4's, but I'm only counting the occurrence in the tens place. Similarly, in the hundreds place, 400-488, each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, regardless of other digits. So, the counting is correct. Similarly, for 8's, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, yes, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds. So, total 98 8's. Therefore, 188 -98=90. So, the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 numbers.\n   - The last range (480-488) contributes 9 numbers.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = \\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, and then the 484 adds one more. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times 4 appears in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range, so yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where 4 is in the tens place. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, so that's correct. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many times that happens. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. To find how many numbers, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and then the 488 adds one more. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place, like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where 8 is in the tens place. Let's count the ranges: From 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-489. Wait, but 480-489 is within 400-488 up to 488, so that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, so does that count as a full 10? No, because 488 is the last page, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, in the 400-488 range, only 9 numbers have 8 in the tens place. So, the first four ranges (0-399) contribute 4 * 10 = 40, and the last range (400-488) contributes 9. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. Wait, but wait, let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.

How many such ranges are there? From 0 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in the 100s, 200s, 300s, and 400s. Wait, but 400s go up to 488, so the tens digit in the 400s would be 40-49, but only up to 488. Wait, no, the tens digit is the second digit from the right. So, in the 400s, the tens digit can be 0-9, but 488 is the limit. So, the tens digit 4 in the 400s would be from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in the 100s, it's 140-149, 10 numbers. In the 200s, 240-249, 10 numbers. In the 300s, 340-349, 10 numbers. But wait, 400-488: the tens digit 4 would be from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 4 sets (100s, 200s, 300s, 400s) each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Wait, but let me check: from 0 to 488, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? Let's see: 0-99: 140-149 is 10 numbers. 100-199: 140-149, another 10. 200-299: 240-249, another 10. 300-399: 340-349, another 10. 400-488: 440-449, another 10. So, that's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers. Wait, that's 5*10=50. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that. So, from 0-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, that's four sets, each with 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. But wait, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 4 sets, 10 each, so 40 times. Wait, but 0-99: 140-149 is within 0-99? No, 140-149 is in 100-199. So, 0-99: the tens digit 4 would be 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, actually, from 0-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). So that's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's 5 sets. So, the tens place contributes 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. Now, adding up the units, tens, and hundreds places: Units: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. Total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, let me check that addition: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Okay, so 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? From 0 to 488, the units digit 8 occurs every 10 numbers. So, the number of times is (488 / 10) + 1? Wait, no, because 488 is the last number. Let's think: from 0 to 488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place. The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. The total count is the number of terms in this sequence. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, (n-1)*10 = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, let's count: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the units, tens, and hundreds places: Units: 49, Tens: 49, Hundreds: 0. Total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " So, 484 is the 49th occurrence. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then an additional 4 in 484. So that's 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 would be up to 449, but our book goes up to 488. So, 440-449 is entirely within 488. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, right? 440, 441, ..., 449. So yes, 10 numbers. So total 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. This happens from 400-488. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 0 to 488, how many multiples of 10 plus 8? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then an additional 8 in 488. So that's 49 times. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last range. Let's count how many ranges: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488). So total for tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

    "text": " So, that's 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, right? So that's correct. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so actually, it's 49 numbers. Because from 0 to 488, each 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. So, how many blocks? Let's see: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, the first four blocks each have 10 numbers, and the last block has 9. So, total for tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** Every 10 numbers contribute one 4, resulting in 49 occurrences (from 4 to 484).\n- **Tens place:** Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences, with 5 such blocks, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** Numbers 400-488 each have a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** Similar to 4's, resulting in 49 occurrences (from 8 to 488).\n- **Tens place:** Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block (480-488) which contributes 9, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since 484 is within 488, it's 49 times. Wait, no, because 488 is the last page. So, the units digit 4 occurs in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The number of terms can be calculated as (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. - From 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. - From 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. - From 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. - From 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. - From 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So, total blocks: 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, in the 400-488 range, does 440-449 fit? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let me check each block: - 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. - 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. - 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. - 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. - 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the hundreds place 4, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (from 80-89, etc.) plus 9 from 480-488. So, 4*10 +9=49. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as page numbers don't reach 800.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the ranges are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400 to 488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Wait, units place: from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in units place is floor(488/10) + 1 if the remainder is >=4. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, which is >=4, so it's 48 + 1 = 49 times. Tens place: Each hundred has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers), 100-199: 140-149 (10), 200-299: 240-249 (10), 300-399: 340-349 (10), and 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is correct. So, 50 times. Hundreds place: From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. So total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, we'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor(488/10)=48. But since 488 ends with 8, we add 1, so 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these is 10 numbers. Let's see: from 0-488, how many such ranges are there? 80-89: yes, 10 numbers. 180-189: yes, 10. 280-289: yes, 10. 380-389: yes, 10. 480-489: but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the 480-489 range only contributes 9 numbers. So, total tens places with 8: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one partial range of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9). So, total tens places: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   There are 49 such numbers (from 4 to 484).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.  \n   Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.  \n   There are 89 such numbers.\n\n**Total 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   There are 49 such numbers.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.  \n   The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, that's 49 times. Wait, but when I divided 484 by 10, I got 48.4, so maybe I should take the floor of 484/10, which is 48, and then add 1 because 484 is included. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, so 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, another 10. 300-399: 340-349, another 10. 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10.

So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. So, every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's.

So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 in the tens place appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, let's count each range. From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289, 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389, 10 numbers. From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, adding these up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place. Wait, but let me double-check. 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40 and 9, total 49. Okay, so 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 times. Adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 starting from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, but the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so that's 89 times. Wait, but let me think: 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, but the hundreds digit is 4 for each, so that's 89 instances. But wait, I think I made a mistake here. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 499, but our book ends at 488, so it's 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 times. Wait, but wait, 400 is the first page with 4 in the hundreds place, and 488 is the last. So, from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 88 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times. Now, adding up the counts for 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let's do the same for 8's. I'll go through each digit position again: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 0 to 488, how many multiples of 10 have an 8 in the units place? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 numbers (since 488 is included). So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is the last range. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which contributes 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488). So, let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9. So, total is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the counts for 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units place: 4,14,...,484. From 0 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let me calculate it as (488 // 10) + 1 if the remainder is >=4. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, which is >=4, so 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct. For 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488. 488//10=48, remainder 8, so 48 +1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit '4':**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit '4' appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit '4' appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit '8':**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit '8' appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit '8' appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges each contribute 10 numbers, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with '8' in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're only going up to 484 in the units place, it's 48 full decades (0-9, 10-19, ..., 480-489). Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range. So, from 0 to 480, that's 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, giving 48. But then from 480 to 488, the units place 4 occurs at 484, so that's one more. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first is 4, then every 10 pages. So, the number of times is floor((488 - 4)/10) + 1. That would be (484)/10 = 48.4, so floor(48.4) = 48, plus 1 gives 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges there are. The first range is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, 140-149, another 10, and so on. The last possible range before 488 would be 440-449, because 450-459 would have 5 in the hundreds place, but wait, no, 440-449 is within 488. Wait, but 488 is 488, so 440-449 is within the book. How many such ranges are there? Let's see: the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. But wait, for the tens place, when the hundreds digit is 0, we're in the two-digit numbers, 40-49. When hundreds digit is 1, it's 140-149, and so on up to 440-449. So, that's 5 ranges (hundreds digit 0,1,2,3,4). Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does the range 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, it's valid. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400 to 488. Each page number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many times that is. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many such ranges there are. The hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. But wait, for the tens place, when hundreds digit is 0, it's 80-89; when hundreds digit is 1, it's 180-189, and so on up to 480-488. So, that's 5 ranges. Each range contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which only goes up to 488. So, the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers? Wait, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units Place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4 to 484, totaling 49 times.\n2. **Tens Place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds Place:** 4 appears from 400 to 488, totaling 89 times.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n1. **Units Place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8 to 488, totaling 49 times.\n2. **Tens Place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds Place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're only going up to 484 for the units place, it's 49 times. Wait, no, actually, from 0 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is floor(488/10) + 1 if the remainder is >=4. Let me calculate 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8. The integer part is 48, and the remainder is 8, which is greater than 4, so we add 1, making it 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 140-149 (10) From 200-299: 240-249 (10) From 300-399: 340-349 (10) From 400-488: 440-449 (10) Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50 times. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 blocks, 10 each, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: Units place: 49, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. Total 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so integer part is 48, and remainder is 8, which is >=8, so we add 1. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many blocks: From 0-99: 80-89 (10) From 100-199: 180-189 (10) From 200-299: 280-289 (10) From 300-399: 380-389 (10) From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so that's 9 numbers, not 10. So, the first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9. So, total in tens place: 4\u00d710 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the 8's: Units place:49, Tens place:49, Hundreds place:0. Total 8's=49+49+0=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: Units:49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 8's. Let me recount the tens place for 8's. From 0-99:80-89 is 10 numbers. 100-199:180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488:9 numbers. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds: total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, that's 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are: 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 is another 10, 340-349 is another 10, and 440-449 is another 10. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. In this case, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. Wait, let me check: from 0 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so the number of 8's in the units place is floor(488/10) + 1 if 488 is included. Wait, 488 is 48*10 + 8, so yes, it's included. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many ranges there are. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So total is 4*10 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's are printed than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges exist up to 488. The first range is 40-49 (10 numbers). Then 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, all 5 ranges are valid. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process, checking each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 0 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Yes, because 488 is included. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each range has 10 numbers. Let's count how many such ranges exist up to 488. The first range is 80-89 (10 numbers). Then 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). The next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, only 480-488 has 9 numbers (since 489 is beyond 488). So, the first four ranges are complete: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, the partial range 480-488 contributes 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 188. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 98. 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, seems correct. But wait, let me think again about the units place for 4's. From 0 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first is 4, then every 10 numbers. So, the number of times is (488 + 1) // 10, but wait, actually, it's (488 // 10) + 1 if 4 is within the range. Wait, maybe I should calculate it as (488 + 1) // 10. Let me think. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is floor((n + 1)/10). So, for n=488, floor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10) = 48. But wait, that would give 48, but earlier I thought it was 49. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me clarify. The formula is floor((n + 1)/10) if we're including 0. But since we're starting from 1, maybe it's slightly different. Wait, from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? The numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. So, the last number is 484, which is 484 = 4 + 10*(k-1), where k is the number of terms. So, 484 = 4 + 10k -10 \u2192 484 = 10k -6 \u2192 10k = 490 \u2192 k=49. So, 49 times. So, my initial count was correct. Similarly, for 8's in the units place: 8,18,...,488. The last number is 488, which is 8 + 10*(k-1) = 488 \u2192 10k = 488 -8 +10 = 490 \u2192 k=49. So, 49 times. So, units place for both 4 and 8 is 49 each. So, that part is correct. Now, tens place for 4's: from 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers. How many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49: yes, 10 numbers. 140-149: yes. 240-249: yes. 340-349: yes. 440-449: yes. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. 5*10=50. So, 50 times in the tens place for 4's. Correct. Now, for 8's in the tens place: ranges are 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges are complete, each with 10 numbers. The last one is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place for 8's. Correct. Hundreds place: for 4's, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers. For 8's, there are no hundreds places since the book only goes up to 488. So, hundreds place for 8's is 0. So, total 4's: 49+50+89=188. Total 8's:49+49+0=98. Difference:188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. This is 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. This is 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. This is 4 full ranges \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, that's 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which means numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. From 200-299: 240-249 is another 10. From 300-399: 340-349 is another 10. From 400-488: 440-449 is another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place, which would be from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). However, I'm only interested in the hundreds digit being 4, so each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, which means 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4, and then an extra 4 in 484. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct. Tens place: Each hundred has a 4 in the tens place for 10 numbers, so from 0-488, how many hundreds? 488 is in the 400s, so we have 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89. So total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and then an extra 8 in 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 400s. So, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except maybe the last one. Let's count: 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the 400s, only 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (from 0-399) plus 9 in 400-488. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is in 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49 + 49 = 98. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For the 8's in the tens place, in the 400-488 range, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480, 481, ..., 488 is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9). So, yes, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 tens place 8's. Units place: 49. Hundreds place: 0. Total 8's: 98. 4's: 188. So, 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups and then 8 more pages. Wait, maybe I should think differently. For each hundred, there are 10 occurrences of 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many hundreds are there? Let's see: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488. So that's 5 sets. Each set from 1-100 has 10 occurrences, so 10*5=50. But wait, in the last set, 401-488, the units place 4 occurs at 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 occurrences, not 10, because 494 would be beyond 488. Wait, no, 484 is within 488, so that's 9 occurrences in 401-488. So, 10 occurrences in each of the first four hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and 9 in the last partial hundred (401-488). So total units place 4's: 10*4 +9=49. Hmm, that seems correct. 2. **Tens place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences. So, from 40-49: 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place. Similarly for 140-149, etc. How many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49 is in 1-100, 140-149 in 101-200, 240-249 in 201-300, 340-349 in 301-400, and 440-449 in 401-500. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 fall entirely within 401-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, total tens place 4's: 5*10=50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. A 4 in the hundreds place occurs in the range 400-499. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds place 4 occurs from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1 =89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) =49+50=99+89=188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens place:50, hundreds place:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Hmm, okay. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many numbers. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place? It's similar to the 4's. Each 10 numbers contribute one 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, which would give 48 occurrences, but since 488 is the last page, which has an 8 in the units place, that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49. Alternatively, thinking in hundreds: 1-100:10, 101-200:10, 201-300:10, 301-400:10, 401-488:9 (since 488 is the last, so 488 is included). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, units place 8's:49. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each range contributes 10 numbers. How many such ranges are there? Let's see: 80-89 is in 1-100, 180-189 in 101-200, 280-289 in 201-300, 380-389 in 301-400, and 480-489. But our book ends at 488, so 480-488 has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So total tens place 8's:10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, yes, 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's:0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but let me check my counts again because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99+89=188. 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, correct. So that's 89. Units place: from 1-488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in units place, so 488/10=48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48, but since 488 is included, which has a 4 in units place at 484, so actually, it's 49. Wait, 488 is 488, which is 4 in the hundreds, 8 in tens, 8 in units. So, the last 4 in units place is 484, which is within 488. So, from 1-488, the number of 4's in units place is (488//10)+1 if the remainder is >=4. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, the number of 4's in units place is 48 full groups (each 10 numbers) plus 1 more if the last partial group has a 4 in units place. Since 48*10=480, and 480+4=484, which is <=488, so yes, 48+1=49. So, units place 4's:49. Similarly, for 8's in units place, same logic:48 full groups, and 488 has an 8, so 49. So, that seems correct. Tens place for 4's: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, except 440-449 is within 401-488, so 10 numbers. So, 5 ranges, 10 each:50. For 8's in tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 ranges, but the last one has only 9 numbers (480-488). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, 49. So, 4's total:49+50+89=188. 8's total:49+49+0=98. So, difference is 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so it's actually 49 numbers. Let me list them: starting at 8, each 10 numbers, so 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. Let's count the blocks: 80-89 is one, 180-189 is another, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. But wait, does 380-389 go up to 389, which is less than 488? Yes, so 40 occurrences. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 89 (number of 8's) = 99. So, there are 99 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** Every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). There are 5 such blocks (0-49, 100-149, ..., 400-449), totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** From 400 to 488, 4 appears 89 times.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** Every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** Every 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89). There are 4 such blocks (0-89, 100-189, ..., 300-389), totaling 40 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n   \nTotal 8's = 49 + 40 = 89.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 89 (8's) = 99.\n\n\\boxed{99}"

    "text": " So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're only going up to 484, which is 484 = 48*10 + 4, so the number of 4's in the units place is 49. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The number of times a digit appears in the units place up to N is floor((N + 1)/10). So, for N=488, it's floor((488 +1)/10) = floor(489/10)=48.9, which is 48. But wait, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 full cycles (from 1-480) which gives 48*1=48, and then from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so no additional 4. So total 48. But wait, 480 is included, which is a 4 in the units place. So, 480 is the 48th occurrence. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. From 1 to 488, the last number with an 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many? Using the same method as before, floor((488 +1)/10) = 48.9, which is 48 full cycles. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 0-488 includes 489 numbers, so 489/10=48.9, so 48 full times, but 488 is the 49th. Wait, but page numbers start at 1, so 8 is at 8, 18, ..., 488. So, how many? The first is 8 (1st), then every 10 numbers. The last is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers (80-89) - 180-189: 10 - 280-289:10 - 380-389:10 - 480-488:9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9). So, total in tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units:48, tens:50, hundreds:89. 48+50=98, +89=187. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, that seems correct. I think I did it right. So, the answer should be 89.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're only going up to 488, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, that's not right. Because from 0 to 488, the number of units places with 4 is (488 // 10) + 1 if the remainder is >=4. Let me calculate it properly. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. Since 8 >=4, we add 1. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, that makes sense. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 all fall within 488? 449 is less than 488, so yes. So, 50 numbers with 4 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, 89 numbers with 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 +89=188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99; 99+89=188. Hmm, 188 4's. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's in units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing an 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, which has an 8 in the units place. So, the number of 8's in the units place is 48 (from 8 to 488, stepping by 10) plus 1 for 488? Wait, no, because 488 is included in the 48th group. Let me think differently. The number of units places with 8 is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra if the last number is beyond. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, the number of units places with 8 is 48 (from 0-480) plus 1 more for 488, making it 49. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so from 0-488, the number of units places with 8 is (488 // 10) + 1 if the remainder is >=8. 488//10=48, remainder 8, which is equal to 8, so we add 1. So, 48 +1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count how many ranges. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299:280-289 (10). From 300-399:380-389 (10). From 400-488:480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place, each of the first four ranges contributes 10 numbers, and the last one contributes 9. So total is 4*10 +9=40+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=49+49=98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188-98=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's: units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99; 99+89=188. That seems correct. Now, the 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because the difference seems quite large. Maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems right. For the tens place, 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. Units place: every 10 numbers, starting at 4, so 4,14,...,484. How many? From 0-488, the number of 4's in units place is floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 is included, and 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so 48+1=49. Correct. For 8's: units place: same logic, 49. Tens place:80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. So, the difference is indeed 188-98=90. Wait, but let me think again. Is there a way to cross-verify this? Maybe by considering the total number of digits and seeing if the counts make sense. Let's see, the total number of digits printed from 1 to 488. Pages 1-9: 9 pages, 1 digit each: 9 digits. Pages 10-99: 90 pages, 2 digits each: 180 digits. Pages 100-488: 488-99=389 pages, 3 digits each: 1167 digits. Total digits:9+180+1167=1356 digits. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98. So, the difference is 90. That seems plausible. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place again. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a formula for digit counting. For a given digit d and position (units, tens, hundreds), the count can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor units place:\nNumber of times d appears = (n // 10) + (1 if n % 10 >= d else 0)\n\nFor tens place:\nNumber of times d appears = (n // 100) * 10 + min((n % 100) + 1, (d * 10) + 10) - (d * 10)\n\nWait, maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, I can think of it as:\n\nFor each digit position, the count is calculated based on higher digits and lower digits.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. My initial method seems correct, so I think the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which would give 48 full tens and then 8 numbers beyond that. But actually, since 484 is the last one, that's 484/10 = 48.4, so 48 full tens, but the last one is 484, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, maybe I should think of it differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place can be calculated by taking the total number of pages divided by 10 and then taking the floor of that. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, which means 48 times. But wait, that would exclude the last partial set. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: from 1 to 488, how many numbers have a 4 in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. The total number is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the digit 8, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, so (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, but let me check: from 0-99: 80-89 (10). 100-199:180-189 (10). 200-299:280-289 (10). 300-399:380-389 (10). 400-488:480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're only considering up to 484 for the units place, it's 48 times. Wait, that might not be right. Let me think again. The number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488 is equal to the number of complete groups of 10, which is 48 full groups (0-9, 10-19, ..., 480-489). But since we're only going up to 488, the last group is 480-488, which still has 9 numbers. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 times. Wait, but 480-488 includes 484, so that's the 49th occurrence. Hmm, maybe I should calculate it as the number of times 4 appears in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48 times, but actually, when you consider that 488 is the last page, the units digit 4 appears once in each group of 10, so from 0 to 480, that's 48 times, and then 484 is another one, making it 49 times. Wait, no, because 480 is the start of the group, so 480 is 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, in the 480-489 group, we have 484 as the 4 in the units place. But since we're only going up to 488, that's still one occurrence. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 (from 0-480) plus 1 (484), totaling 49. Wait, but 488/10 is 48.8, which would mean 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But 484 is within the 480-489 group, which is the 49th group. So, maybe it's 49 times. I'm a bit confused here. Let me think differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place up to N is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus one if the units digit of N is >= the digit. Wait, maybe not. Let's take a smaller example. Suppose N=24. How many 4's in the units place? 4,14,24. That's 3 times. So, floor(24/10)=2, but we have 3. So, it's floor((24 +1)/10)=3. Wait, that might not be the right formula. Alternatively, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is equal to (N // 10) + (1 if N % 10 >= d else 0). So, applying that here, N=488. So, 488 //10=48, and 488%10=8, which is >=4, so add 1. So, total 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. Okay, that makes sense. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where 4 is in the tens place. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 440-449, which is within 488. Let me count how many such ranges there are. The first range is 0-99: 40-49, that's 10 numbers. Then 100-199: 140-149, another 10. 200-299: 240-249, 10. 300-399: 340-349, 10. 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers (440-449). Wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, each hundred contributes 10 numbers where 4 is in the tens place. How many hundreds are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. That's 5 hundreds. So, 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's the fifth range. So, total 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 40-49: 10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5*10=50. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Therefore, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, let me add that again: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** How many times does 8 appear in the units place? Using the same method as for 4. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, 488//10=48, and 488%10=8, which is >=8, so add 1. So, 48+1=49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Similar to the 4's, but let's check. The ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. So, each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers, except the last one, which contributes 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-489 is 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, the first four ranges are full: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). The last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total times 8 appears in the tens place is 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** How many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188-98=90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 8. Let me recount that. The tens digit is 8 in the ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges contributes 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so that's 9. So, total 40+9=49. That seems correct. Similarly, for 4's in the tens place, we had 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 50. And for the hundreds place, 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89. So, 4's total 188, 8's total 98. Difference is 90. Wait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, that's correct. Okay, so I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full ranges and the partial range 480-488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're only going up to 484, it's 48 full tens, each contributing a 4 in the units place. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. For units place, the number of 4's is equal to the number of complete groups of 10. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? That's 488 // 10 = 48. So, 48 times 4 appears in the units place. But wait, 488 is 48*10 + 8, so the last group is incomplete, but the units place 4's would still be 48. Hmm, but wait, when counting up to 488, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence because 0-9 is the first group, 10-19 the second, etc., so 484 is the 49th group. Wait, no, because 0-9 is the first group, 10-19 the second, so 480-489 would be the 49th group, but since we're only going up to 488, the units place 4's would be 49 times? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach. The number of times a digit appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number by 10 and taking the floor. So, 488 // 10 = 48, but then we have an extra 4 at 484, which is 48*10 + 4 = 484, so that's 48 +1 = 49? No, wait, no, because 488 is 48*10 +8, so the units place 4's would be 48 times. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as for each 10 numbers, there's one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many 4's in units place? It's the number of complete groups of 10, which is 48, plus any extra in the incomplete group. The incomplete group is from 480 to 488, which includes 484, so that's one more 4. So total units place 4's would be 48 +1 = 49. Okay, so units place: 49 times 4 appears.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? This happens every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, etc. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, how many such ranges are there up to 488? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 440-449 is within 488. So, yes, 5 ranges, 50 times. So, tens place: 50 times 4 appears.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? This happens in the range 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 +50 +89 = 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, but for 8's. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So, how many such numbers? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing an 8 in the units place, plus the last group which is 480-488, which includes 488, so that's one more 8. So, units place 8's: 48 +1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? This happens in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but 480-489 would be up to 489, but our book only goes up to 488, so the range is 480-488. So, how many such ranges are there? Let's see: 80-89 is the first, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 5 ranges, but the last one is incomplete. For the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributes 10 8's in the tens place. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 for all numbers from 480 to 489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, in the tens place, the 8's occur 10 times in each of the first four ranges and 9 times in the last partial range. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? This would be in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 +49 +0 = 98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98. That seems correct.\n\nSo, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me check the tens place for 8's again. I said that 480-488 contributes 9 8's in the tens place. But wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, the tens digit is 8 for all these, so that's 9 times. So, yes, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, I had 5 ranges: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each contributes 10 4's, so 5*10=50.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine.\n\nAnd for hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nUnits place for 4's: from 4,14,...,484, which is 48 full groups (480 numbers) plus 484, which is the 49th occurrence.\n\nWait, but 488//10=48, but since 488 is 48*10 +8, the units digit cycles 48 times, but the 49th occurrence is at 484, which is less than 488, so yes, 49 units place 4's.\n\nSame for 8's in units place: 48 full groups (480 numbers) plus 488, so 49 occurrences.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is calculated by examining each digit position (units, tens, hundreds). Similarly, the number of times 8 appears is calculated. \n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're only going up to 484 in the units place, it's 48 times, but starting from 0, so actually, it's 49 times. Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra. From 1 to 488, there are 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But since 488 is the last page, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence because 0-9 is the first decade, 10-19 the second, etc., up to 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the 480-488 range has one 4 in the units place at 484. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.), there's a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many hundreds are there? 488 is less than 500, so we have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. Wait, actually, each hundred block contributes 10 numbers with the tens digit as 4. So, for 1-100: 40-49 (10 numbers). For 101-200: 140-149 (10 numbers). Similarly, 240-249 and 340-349, each contributing 10. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's included. So, total 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's printed are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full decades, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so from 1-488, how many 8's in the units place? It's the same as the number of times 8 appears in the units place, which is every 10 numbers. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, which means 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, plus one more for the 488. Wait, no, actually, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 0-9, 8 is the first occurrence, then 18, etc. So, the number of 8's in the units place is 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these contributes 10 numbers. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in the ranges: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 40 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only has 488 pages, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (40) = 89. So, total 8's printed are 89. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the total 8's from the total 4's: 188 - 89 = 99. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=40, hundreds=0. 49+40=89. 188-89=99. Hmm, seems correct. But wait, did I count the hundreds place correctly? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Yes, that's correct. For 8's, the hundreds place is 0 because 800-899 isn't included. So, yes, 89 8's in total. Therefore, the difference is 99 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, this happens 49 times (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers in each hundred (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 5 such sets (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), contributing 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers in each hundred (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).

    "text": " So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, let's see how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one block. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks in total. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but we need to check if 488 is included. Since 488 is 48\u00d710 + 8, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 8's. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 80-89 is one block. From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. Now, from 400-488: The next block would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, we only have 480-488. So, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the blocks are: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, total 8's in the tens place: 4 blocks \u00d710 + 1 block \u00d79 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 8's. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, subtracting the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as pages go up to 488.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, that's 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, looking at the hundreds place, the 4 appears in the hundreds digit for numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, I'm only interested in the hundreds digit being 4, which it is for all these numbers. So, that's 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4 in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times. Now, I need to count how many times the digit 8 appears. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, from 0 to 488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because starting from 0, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place, so from 0 to 488, that's 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count these ranges. From 0-99: 80-89, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. Similarly, 280-289 and 380-389. Now, does 480-489 fall within 488? Well, 480-489 would be the next range, but since the book ends at 488, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, so in the hundreds place, 480-488 is part of the 400s, so the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, but only 9 numbers because 489 is beyond 488. So, how many ranges do we have? From 0-99: 1 range (80-89) = 10 numbers. From 100-199: 1 range (180-189) = 10. From 200-299: 280-289 = 10. From 300-399: 380-389 = 10. From 400-488: 480-488 = 9 numbers. So, total in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero occurrences of 8 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8 in each place: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.

The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is beyond 488, so I need to check if 449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that block is included. Now, each block contributes 10 numbers where 4 is in the tens place. So, from 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 include 440 to 449, which is 10 numbers? Yes. So, 50 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is the 49th 8 in the units place? Let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. So, starting from 0, the first 8 is at 8, then every 10. So, the number of 8's in the units place is (488 /10) = 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction, it's 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, because 488 is the last number, so from 0 to 488, inclusive, how many 8's in units place? Let me think differently. The number of times 8 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, the 48th group would end at 480, and then 481-488 would be the next group, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: from 0 to 488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place? It's the floor of 488 /10) +1 if the last number is included. Wait, no, actually, the count is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 =48 +1=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. So, each block contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which contributes 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, first four blocks: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 blocks, each 10, so 40. Then, the last block is 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're only going up to 488, the number of 4's in the units place is 49. Wait, no, 488 is the last page, so 484 is included. Let me calculate it as (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where 4 is in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49: 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149: 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249: 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349: 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449: 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, total blocks: 5. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but does 449 count? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the count is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each block contributes 10 numbers, except possibly the last one. Let's check each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: Here, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, the 8's in 480-488 are 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 in 480-488. That's 4*10 +9 = 40 +9=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where 8 is in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place: 0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I feel like that might be correct, but let me cross-verify. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again. Hundreds place for 4's: from 400 to 488 inclusive. 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So that's correct. For the tens place of 4's, I considered 5 blocks: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. Units place: 49. Tens place:50. Hundreds:89. Total 188. For 8's: units place: from 8 to 488, step 10. 8,18,...488. How many terms? (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, the last block has 9 numbers. So 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, since 800+ is beyond 488. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, actually, it's 49 times. Hmm, maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me think again. The number of times a digit appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, it's 48. But wait, 488 is the last page, so from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in each set of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles). Wait, but 488 is included, so does that mean the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is within 480-489, so yes, 48 times. So, units place: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, that's 10 numbers. Then 100-199: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, another 10. 300-399: 340-349, another 10. 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, how many ranges? 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's okay. So, the tens place has 50 occurrences of 4. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 +89=187. So, total number of 4's is 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is included, so let's see. The first occurrence is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is 488/10=48.8, so 48 full cycles, but since 488 is included, it's 49 occurrences. Wait, no: from 0-488, the units digit cycles 48 times (since 488//10=48), so the number of 8's in units place is 48. Because 488 is the 49th number, but in the units place, it's the 49th occurrence? Wait, no, because 0-9: 8 is the 8th number, 10-19: 18, etc. So, from 0 to 488, the number of 8's in the units place is (488//10) + 1 if the remainder is >=8. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, the number of 8's in units place is 48 +1=49. Wait, but page numbers start at 1, so does that affect it? Let me think: page 8 is included, page 18, ..., page 488. So, how many? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, yes, 49 times. So, units place: 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8's in the tens place occur in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 80-89, that's 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189, another 10. 200-299: 280-289, another 10. 300-399: 380-389, another 10. 400-488: 480-489, but 480-489 is within 400-488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, so the range 480-489 would normally be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 9 numbers. So, how does that affect the count? Let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, but is 480-488 included? Yes, because 480 is within 400-488. So, that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is in 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of '4's:**\n   - **Units place:** Every 10 numbers have a '4' in the units place. From 1 to 488, this occurs 48 times (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, taking the integer part).\n   - **Tens place:** '4' appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** '4' appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total '4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the number of '8's:**\n   - **Units place:** Every 10 numbers have an '8' in the units place. From 1 to 488, this occurs 49 times (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, and the last '8' is at 488).\n   - **Tens place:** '8' appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full ranges (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10, and the last range 480-488 contributes 9. Total: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with '8' in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's - Number of '8's = 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since 484 is the last one, that's 49 times. Wait, maybe I should think differently. From 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then in the 49th decade (480-488), the 4 appears once at 484. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 times. Okay, so 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400 to 488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, let me add up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times does this happen? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then in the 49th decade (480-488), the 8 appears once at 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let me count these: From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is a partial range. How many numbers are there? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, the 8's are: 4 full ranges (each contributing 10) and one partial range contributing 9. So, 4 * 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. Total: 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct. For 8's: units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. Total: 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 8's. Let me check again. In the tens place, 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9. So, that's 4 full tens and one partial. 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That's correct. So, yes, 49 in tens place. Units place: 49, tens:49, total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 188 - 98 = 90. \n\n$\\boxed{90}$"
