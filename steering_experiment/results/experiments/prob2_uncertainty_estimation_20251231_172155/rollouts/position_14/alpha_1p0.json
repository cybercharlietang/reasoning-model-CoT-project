    "text": " Hmm, but maybe a better way is to consider that from 1 to 488, each block of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488? That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. So, there are 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then a partial block from 481 to 488, which includes 484. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but when I think about it, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, meaning 48 complete blocks, each with one 4 in the units place, and then the 49th block starts at 481, so 484 is the 4th number in that block, so that's one more 4. So, total 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? Let's see: from 1 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49 (which is 10 numbers), 140-149 (another 10), 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the digit 8, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? From 1 to 488, each block of 10 has one 8 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8, and the last block from 481 to 488 includes 488, which is an 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such blocks are within 488. 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 another 10, 280-289, 380-389. So, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 = 40 times. Wait, but 488 is beyond 400, so does 480-489 count? Yes, but 480-489 is within 488, so that's another block. So, actually, it's 5 blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But wait, 480-489 is pages 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (since 489 is beyond 488). So, in the tens place, 480-488: the tens digit is 8, but only up to 488. So, how many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, in the tens place, 480-488 contributes 9 occurrences of 8. So, for the tens place, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 occurrences, so 4*10=40, plus the last partial block from 480-488, which is 9 occurrences. So total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, but earlier I thought maybe 5 blocks, but one is partial. So, total 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor the number of 4's:\n- Units place: 49 times. Let me verify. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4, and then in the 49th block (481-490), but since we only go up to 488, the 4 in the units place is at 484. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\n- Tens place: 50 times. Each block of 100 has one block where the tens digit is 4, contributing 10 numbers. So, from 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each with 10 occurrences, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 times. From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nFor the number of 8's:\n- Units place: 49 times. Same logic as 4's, except the last occurrence is at 488. So, 48 full blocks, each with one 8, and the 49th block includes 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: I had a bit more confusion here. Let's see. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4 full blocks contributing 10 each, and one partial block contributing 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, since the book doesn't reach 800. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is calculated by examining each digit position (units, tens, and hundreds). Similarly, the number of times the digit 8 appears is counted. \n\n- **For 4's:**\n  - Units place: 49 times\n  - Tens place: 50 times\n  - Hundreds place: 89 times\n  - Total: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times\n\n- **For 8's:**\n  - Units place: 49 times\n  - Tens place: 49 times\n  - Hundreds place: 0 times\n  - Total: 49 + 49 = 98 times\n\nThe difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, but that's not exact. Let me think differently. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 488 is included, so does 488 have a 4 in the units place? No, it's 8. So maybe it's 48 times? Wait, let me check: from 1 to 480, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place, so 480 / 10 = 48. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so no 4 in the units place. So total 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set would be 440-449, since 480-489 would be beyond 488. Let's count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, so for each hundred, there's one set of 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. From 1-99: 40-49, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, from 400-488, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but what about 450-488? The tens digit there is 5,6,7,8, so no more 4's in the tens place beyond 449. So yes, 5 sets, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? From 1 to 488, the last number with 8 in units place is 488. So 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so 48+1=49? Wait, let me check: from 1-480, 480/10=48 numbers with 8 in units place. Then from 481-488, 488 is included, so that's one more, making it 49. So units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each set: From 1-99: 80-89, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, 10. From 200-299: 280-289, 10. From 300-399: 380-389, 10. From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 9 numbers. So total for tens place: 4 sets of 10 (from 1-399) plus 9 in 400-488. So 4*10=40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So hundreds place: 0 times. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. So there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is calculated by examining each digit position (units, tens, hundreds).

    "text": " Maybe I should think of it as from 0 to 488, but since we start at 1, it's from 1 to 488. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra. From 1 to 488, the number of complete decades is 48 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades). But wait, each decade contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, the last page is 488, so in the 488th page, the units digit is 8, so the 48th decade ends at 480, and then we have pages 481 to 488. So, in the units place, we have 48 occurrences of 4. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. Starting from 40-49: that's one block. Then 140-149: another, 240-249: another, 340-349: another, and 440-449: another. So that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let's do the same for 8's. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. How many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, the number of 8's in the units place is the number of times 8 appears in the units digit. The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see: from 0 to 488, how many multiples of 10 plus 8 are there? It's the same as (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place, such as 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 8's. Let's count the blocks. 80-89: one block, 180-189: another, 280-289: another, 380-389: another. So that's 4 blocks. Each contributes 10, so 4 * 10 = 40. But wait, does 380-389 fit into 488? Yes, because 389 is less than 488. So, 40 occurrences. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, total 8's: 89. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 89 (8's) = 98. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units place: 48, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 187. For 8's: units:49, tens:40, hundreds:0, total 89. So, 187 - 89 = 98. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me verify each step again. Units place for 4: from 4 to 484, every 10 pages. So, 484 is the last one. So, (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49? Wait, no, because 484 is the 48th occurrence after 4. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recalculate the units place for 4's. The first 4 in units is at 4, then 14, 24,..., up to 484. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. We need to find n such that 4 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488. Let's solve for n: 4 + 10(n-1) \u2264 488 \u2192 10(n-1) \u2264 484 \u2192 n-1 \u2264 48.4 \u2192 n \u2264 49.4. So, n=49. So, 49 times in the units place, not 48. Wait, so I think I made a mistake earlier. I thought it was 48, but it's actually 49. So, units place for 4's: 49. Similarly, let's check the tens place for 4's. We have 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, so 50 is correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, total 4's: 49 +50 +89= 188. Wait, so earlier I thought 48, but it's 49. So, total 4's: 188. Now, for 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488. Let's see, how many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. 8 +10(n-1) \u2264488 \u219210(n-1) \u2264480 \u2192n-1 \u226448 \u2192n=49. So, 49 times in units place. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389. That's 4 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 40. Hundreds place: none, as before. So, total 8's:49+40=89. So, the difference is 188 (4's) -89 (8's)=99. Wait, so earlier I thought 187-89=98, but now I see that units place for 4's is 49, so total 4's is 188, making the difference 99. So, I think I made a mistake in the initial count of units place for 4's, thinking it was 48 instead of 49. So, the correct difference is 99. Let me confirm again. Units place for 4's: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49. Tens place: 5 blocks, each 10 numbers, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place:49, tens:40, total 89. So, 188-89=99. So, the answer should be 99 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit '4' and '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding how many more '4's are printed than '8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place (Ones Place):** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). The sequence starts at 4 and ends at 484. The number of terms is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = \\frac{480}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n     So, '4' appears 49 times in the units place.\n   \n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '4' appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such ranges:\n     \\[\n     5 \\times 10 = 50\n     \\]\n     So, '4' appears 50 times in the tens place.\n   \n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. The number of pages is:\n     \\[\n     488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n     \\]\n     So, '4' appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\n   - **Total '4's:** Summing up the occurrences:\n     \\[\n     49 (\\text{units}) + 50 (\\text{tens}) + 89 (\\text{hundreds}) = 188\n     \\]\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place (Ones Place):** The digit '8' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). The sequence starts at 8 and ends at 488. The number of terms is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = \\frac{480}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n     So, '8' appears 49 times in the units place.\n   \n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '8' appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, and 380-389. Each range contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 4 such ranges:\n     \\[\n     4 \\times 10 = 40\n     \\]\n     So, '8' appears 40 times in the tens place.\n   \n   - **Hundreds Place:** Since the book has only 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches '8'. So, '8' appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\n   - **Total '8's:** Summing up the occurrences:\n     \\[\n     49 (\\text{units}) + 40 (\\text{tens}) + 0 (\\text{hundreds}) = 89\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of '8's from the total number of '4's:\n     \\[\n     188 (\\text{total '4's}) - 89 (\\text{total '8's}) = 99\n     \\]\n\n**Answer:** The number of '4's printed exceeds the number of '8's by 99.\n\n\\boxed{99}"

    "text": " But since we can't have a fraction of a page, I think it's 49 times because from 4 to 484, that's 49 numbers. Wait, let me check. From 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This would be numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's see how many times that is. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. Similarly, 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid, but 540-549 would be beyond 488, but we're not considering that here. So, how many hundreds do we have? From 0-400, we have 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, 5 sets of hundreds. But wait, 400-488 is only part of the 400s. So, in the 400s, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, except maybe the last one, we have 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 0-99: 10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:10 (since 440-449 is within 400-488). So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5*10=50 times in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many hundreds we have. 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. 100-199:180-189 is 10. 200-299:280-289 is 10. 300-399:380-389 is 10. 400-488: Now, 480-489 would be where the tens digit is 8, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the 400s, it's only 9 numbers instead of 10. So, total tens place: 0-99:10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's:98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I feel like I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me check the tens place for 4's again. From 0-99: 40-49 is 10, 100-199:140-149 is 10, 200-299:240-249 is 10, 300-399:340-349 is 10, 400-488:440-449 is 10. So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Correct. For 8's in the tens place: 0-99:10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, 49. Correct. Units place: both 4 and 8 have 49 occurrences. So, 4's total 188, 8's total 98. The difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each hundred contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. Each hundred contributes 10, except the last which contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, that might not be exact. Alternatively, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is the last page with a 4 in the units place. So from 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Hmm, maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me think again. For each set of 10 numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. The total number of sets is 488 / 10 = 48.8, meaning there are 48 full sets and a partial set from 481 to 488. Each full set contributes one 4, so 48 times. Now, in the partial set from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 is within this range, which adds one more 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within the range, but 540-549 would be beyond 488, so we don't have that. So, how many blocks are there? From 40-49: 10 numbers, then 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So that's 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488, but let me check. Wait, 400-488 is the range where the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since our book ends at 488, it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, but is that correct? Let me think again. The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers where the hundreds digit is exactly 4. So, from 400 to 499, but since we only go up to 488, it's 400 to 488, which is indeed 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the last block. Each full block (80-89, 180-189, etc.) contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's see how many full blocks we have. The blocks are: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since we only go up to 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, the first four blocks are full, each contributing 10 8's, and the last block contributes 9 8's. So, total in tens place: 4 * 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The blocks are: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place, and the last block contributes 9 8's. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's: Units place: 49, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct. Now for 8's: Units place: 49, Tens place: 49, Hundreds place: 0. 49 + 49 is 98. So, 188 - 98 is indeed 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of 4's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Number of blocks: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Each block contributes 10 4's.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 89.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of 8's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Full blocks: 4 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 8's.\n   - Partial block: 480-488 contributes 9 8's.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "is_correct": true,
    "num_tokens": 5487,
    "hit_max_tokens": false,
    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think of it as the number of times 4 appears in the units place. Since every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups. Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the 48th group ends at 480, and then we have 481-488. In the units place, 484 is part of this last group, so it's included. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks is 10 numbers long, and each contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 40-49: that's one block. Then 140-149: that's another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, that's 5 blocks in total. Each block gives 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, I need to check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's printed are 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many times. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many groups of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups. Each group gives one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence? Wait, let's see: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning there are 48 full decades and a partial. Each full decade gives one 8, so 48. But in the partial decade, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 is included once. So total 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place. Wait, that seems correct because 488 is the last page, so units digits go up to 8, so yes, 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block is 10 numbers, contributing 10 8's in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89: one block, 180-189: another, 280-289: another, 380-389: another. So that's 4 blocks. Each gives 10 8's, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, does 480-489 have an 8 in the tens place? Yes, 480-489, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's another block, but only 9 numbers. Wait, but in terms of the tens place, each block is 10 numbers, but here we have only 9 because 489 is beyond 488. So, does that mean the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in 480-488? But wait, I think I should consider it as a separate case because 480-488 is part of the hundreds digit 4. So, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks * 10 = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 49. Wait, but earlier I thought the blocks were 80-89, 180-189, etc., which are 4 blocks, each giving 10 8's, so 40. Then, the 480-488 gives 9 more 8's in the tens place, so total 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so total 98 8's. But wait, when I counted the 4's, I had 187, so the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 8's.\n\nWait, in the tens place, I considered 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each giving 10 8's, so 40. Then, 480-488 is another 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 more, making 49. So total 49 in tens place.\n\nUnits place: 49, tens place: 49, so total 98 8's.\n\nWait, but when I count the 4's, I had 187, so 187 - 98 = 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me check again, perhaps I overcounted the 8's.\n\nWait, in the units place, from 1 to 488, how many 8's are there?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so 8 occurs once every 10 numbers. So, total number of 8's in units place is floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 ends with 8, that's the 49th occurrence. So, 49 units place 8's.\n\nIn the tens place, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. For example, 80-89, 180-189, etc. How many such blocks are there in 488?\n\nFrom 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers.\n\n100-199: 180-189: 10 numbers.\n\n200-299: 280-289: 10 numbers.\n\n300-399: 380-389: 10 numbers.\n\n400-488: 480-488: 9 numbers.\n\nSo, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nSo, 4's: 187, 8's: 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 89 more than the number of 8's.\n\nBut let me think again, maybe I missed something. For example, in the hundreds place, I didn't count any 8's, which is correct because the book only goes up to 488. So, no page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but when counting the 4's in the hundreds place, I had 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 4's there. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place for 4's, I had 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these gives 10 4's in the tens place, so 5*10=50.\n\nIn the units place for 4's, I had 488/10=48.8, so 48 full groups, each giving one 4, and then 484 is included in the last partial group, so 48+1=49? Wait, no, earlier I thought it was 48, but let me check again.\n\nWait, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nIt's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. The next would be 494, but 494 is beyond 488, so the last one is 484.\n\nSo, how many terms are in this sequence? The first term is 4, the last term is 484, common difference 10.\n\nNumber of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 48, but actually, it's 49. So, I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nSo, units place 4's: 49.\n\nTens place 4's: 50.\n\nHundreds place 4's: 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier count. So, I think I made a mistake earlier when I thought units place 4's were 48. It's actually 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, units place was 49, tens place 49, so total 98.\n\nSo, now, 4's: 188, 8's:98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, so that's different. So, I think I made a mistake in the units place for 4's earlier. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, units place 4's: from 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many terms? The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10=484.\n\nSo, 4 +10(n-1)=484.\n\n10(n-1)=480.\n\nn-1=48.\n\nn=49.\n\nSo, 49 times.\n\nSo, units place 4's:49.\n\nTens place:50.\n\nHundreds place:89.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\n8's: units 49, tens 49, total 98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 89. So, I must have miscalculated the units place for 4's.\n\nYes, so the correct count is 49 units place 4's, leading to total 4's being 188, 8's 98, difference 90.\n\nI think that's the correct answer now.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences (from 4 to 484, step 10).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences (from 8 to 488, step 10).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 40, plus 9 occurrences in 480-488, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, from 1 to 488, the last number with 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Each number here has a hundreds digit of 4. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, 4 appears 187 times. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers except maybe the last one. Let's check: From 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, for 400-488, only 9 numbers have 8 in the tens place. So, total for tens place: 4 ranges with 10 each and 1 range with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 times. Adding up all occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   \nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Wait, maybe a better way is to consider that from 1 to 488, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4. That gives 48 fours. But wait, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digit is 4 at 484, so that's included in the 48. So, total 48 fours in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 fours, so 5*10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many? From 1 to 488, every block of 10 has one 8 in the units place. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8. That's 48 eights. But wait, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digit is 8 at 488, which is included in the 48. So, total 48 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these contributes 10 eights in the tens place. How many such ranges are there? From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 ranges. So, 4*10 = 40 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place, but wait, the hundreds digit can only be up to 4 because the book has 488 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (48) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 40 = 88. So, there are 88 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 187 fours - 88 eights = 99. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. For eights: units 48, tens 40, hundreds 0. 48+40=88. So, 187-88=99. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting the hundreds place, maybe I made a mistake. Wait, in the hundreds place for fours, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. That seems right. For eights, in the hundreds place, since 488 is less than 800, there are none. So, yes, 88 eights. So, the difference is 99. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the units place for fours. Let me check again. Units place for fours: from 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. How many terms? The last term is 484, which is 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. Wait, that's 49 fours in the units place. But earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then 14, 24, ..., 484. So, the number of such numbers is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, I was wrong earlier; it's 49 fours in the units place, not 48. That changes things. So, units place: 49 fours. Tens place: 50 fours. Hundreds place: 89 fours. Total fours: 49 + 50 +89 = 188. Wait, that's one more than before. Now, for eights: units place: from 8, 18, ..., 488. The last term is 488. So, (488 -8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. So, units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 40 eights. Hundreds place: 0. Total eights: 49 +40 =89. So, now, the difference is 188 fours -89 eights=99. Wait, that's the same as before. Because I had 187 fours and 88 eights, which also gave 99. But now, with fours as 188 and eights as 89, the difference is still 99. Wait, no, 188-89=99. So, same result. But I think I made a mistake in the initial count of fours in the units place. So, the correct count is 49 fours in units, 50 in tens, 89 in hundreds, totaling 188. Eights: 49 units, 40 tens, 0 hundreds, totaling 89. So, 188-89=99. So, the answer should be 99. But let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I can use a formula for counting digits. The number of times a digit d appears from 1 to N can be calculated using a formula, but I'm not sure about the exact formula, so maybe it's safer to count manually as I did. Alternatively, I can think of each digit position separately. Let's try that again, more carefully. **Counting Fours:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Numbers ending with 4: 4,14,24,...,484.\n   - The sequence is 4 +10k, where k=0 to m.\n   - 4 +10m \u2264488 \u219210m \u2264484 \u2192m=48.4, so m=48.\n   - So, numbers are 4,14,...,484: total 49 numbers. So, 49 fours.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Numbers where tens digit is 4: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449.\n   - Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers.\n   - How many such blocks? From 0-99: 40-49 (1 block)\n   - 100-199:140-149 (1)\n   - 200-299:240-249 (1)\n   - 300-399:340-349 (1)\n   - 400-488:440-449 (1)\n   - So, total 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours.\n   - So, 5*10=50 fours.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Numbers where hundreds digit is 4: 400-488.\n   - From 400 to 488, inclusive.\n   - 488 -400 +1 =89 numbers.\n   - So, 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188.\n\n**Counting Eights:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Numbers ending with 8:8,18,28,...,488.\n   - The sequence is 8 +10k, where k=0 to m.\n   - 8 +10m \u2264488 \u219210m \u2264480 \u2192m=48.\n   - So, numbers are 8,18,...,488: total 49 numbers. So, 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Numbers where tens digit is 8:80-89,180-189,...,380-389.\n   - Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers.\n   - How many such blocks? From 0-99:80-89 (1 block)\n   - 100-199:180-189 (1)\n   - 200-299:280-289 (1)\n   - 300-399:380-389 (1)\n   - 400-488: but 480-489 would be next, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 only in 480-489, but since we stop at 488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but earlier I thought it's 4 blocks, but actually, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but since we're counting full tens, maybe it's considered as a partial block. Wait, but earlier I thought the tens digit 8 occurs in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the last one is only up to 488. So, how many full blocks of tens digit 8? Let's see:\n\n   - 80-89:10 numbers\n   - 180-189:10\n   - 280-289:10\n   - 380-389:10\n   - 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\n   So, total eights in tens place:4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 40. Hmm, this is conflicting. Wait, no, because in the hundreds place, 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have:\n\n   - 80-89:10\n   - 180-189:10\n   - 280-289:10\n   - 380-389:10\n   - 480-488:9\n\n   So, total eights in tens place:10+10+10+10+9=49. But earlier I thought it was 40. So, which is correct?\n\n   Wait, when I first counted, I thought there were 4 ranges, each contributing 10 eights, but that's only if each range is complete. However, the last range (480-488) is incomplete, contributing only 9 eights. So, actually, the total eights in the tens place would be 4*10 +9=49. But that contradicts my earlier count where I thought it was 40. So, which is correct?\n\n   Wait, let's list the ranges:\n\n   - 80-89:10 eights\n   - 180-189:10\n   - 280-289:10\n   - 380-389:10\n   - 480-488:9\n\n   So, total eights in tens place:10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\n   But wait, the problem is that in the 480-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place:4*10 +9=49.\n\n   But earlier, I thought it was 40. So, which is correct? Let me check.\n\n   Alternatively, maybe I should consider that in each hundred block, the tens digit cycles from 0-9, so in each hundred block, the tens digit 8 occurs exactly 10 times. So, from 1-400, how many hundreds blocks are there? 4: 0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399. Each contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place:40+9=49.\n\n   So, that's correct. Therefore, the eights in the tens place are 49, not 40 as I initially thought. So, that changes the total eights.\n\n   So, eights in units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds place:0. Total eights:49+49=98.\n\n   Wait, but earlier I thought units place was 49 and tens place was 40, totaling 89. Now, with tens place being 49, total eights would be 49+49=98.\n\n   But wait, let's confirm. Units place:8,18,...,488. How many? From 8 to 488, step 10. So, (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in units place.\n\n   Tens place: as above, 49 eights.\n\n   So, total eights:49+49=98.\n\n   Now, total fours:188, total eights:98.\n\n   So, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\n   Wait, but earlier I thought it was 99, but now it's 90. Hmm, I'm confused. Let me recast the problem.\n\n   Maybe I should use a more systematic approach. Let's consider each digit position separately for both fours and eights.\n\n   **Counting Fours:**\n\n   - **Units place:**\n     - Numbers:4,14,24,...,484.\n     - Number of terms: (484-4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49.\n\n   - **Tens place:**\n     - Numbers:40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449.\n     - Each contributes 10 fours.\n     - Number of such blocks:5 (from 0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488).\n     - So, 5*10=50.\n\n   - **Hundreds place:**\n     - Numbers:400-488.\n     - Number of terms:488-400 +1=89.\n\n   - Total fours:49+50+89=188.\n\n   **Counting Eights:**\n\n   - **Units place:**\n     - Numbers:8,18,28,...,488.\n     - Number of terms: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49.\n\n   - **Tens place:**\n     - Numbers:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488.\n     - Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights.\n     - The last block (480-488) contributes 9 eights.\n     - So, total eights in tens place:4*10 +9=49.\n\n   - **Hundreds place:**\n     - Numbers:800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no eights in the hundreds place.\n\n   - Total eights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\n   Therefore, the difference is 188 fours -98 eights=90.\n\n   Wait, but earlier I thought it was 99, but now it's 90. Which is correct?\n\n   Let me recount the eights in the tens place. From 80-89:10 eights, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place.\n\n   So, total eights:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\n   Therefore, 188-98=90.\n\n   So, the correct answer should be 90.\n\n   Wait, but earlier I thought the tens place for eights was 40, which led to 89 eights, but that was a mistake because I didn't account for the partial block in the hundreds place.\n\n   So, the correct count is 98 eights, leading to a difference of 90 fours.\n\n   Therefore, the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None (since pages go up to 488) \u2192 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, but since 484 is the last one, maybe it's better to think of it as (484 - 4)/10 + 1. Let me check: (484 - 4) is 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many full hundreds we have. From 1-99: 40-49, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. Now, from 400-488: The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 400-488, right? So that's another 10. So, how many hundreds are there? From 0-399, that's four sets of 100, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, another 10, so total 50. Wait, but wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but 488 is beyond that, so that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 188 4's. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many such numbers? (488 - 8)/10 + 1. Let's compute: 488-8=480, 480/10=48, 48+1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. From 1-99: 80-89, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: The tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, so that's 9 instead of 10. So, let's compute: From 0-399: 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. From 400-488: 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 40+9=49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 98 8's. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each 100 numbers contribute 10 occurrences.\n   - From 1-399: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - From 400-488: 440-449 contributes 10.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears from 400-488.\n   - Total: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each 100 numbers contribute 10 occurrences.\n   - From 1-399: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - From 400-488: 480-488 contributes 9.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should think differently. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the number of 4's in the units place would be the number of complete groups of 10, which is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a number, I think it's 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page. So, the last group is 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the units digit 4 occurs at 484. So, from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let me think. Each 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full times, and then in the 49th group, which is 481-490, the 4 in the units place is at 484, so that's one more. So, total 49 times? Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, the number of times a digit appears in the units place can be calculated as floor(n/10) + 1 if the digit is less than the units digit of n. But maybe a better approach is to consider each position separately. Let me try again. For the units place, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear? It appears once every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full cycles of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. But wait, in the last partial cycle (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 484 is within that, so that's one more 4. So total 49 times. Hmm, I think that's correct. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 times the digit 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 times, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's see. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial cycle, 481-488, the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included, so that's one more 8. So, total 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. So, each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 times each, so 4*10=40. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), so 9 times the digit 8 in the tens place. So total in tens place: 40+9=49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Adding up all occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98 times. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, which rounds up to 49).\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges, each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers.

    "text": " Wait, but since we're dealing with whole numbers, it should be 49 times because from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. Let me check: 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so the integer part is 48, but since 484 is included, we add 1, making it 49. Wait, but actually, the number of times the units digit is 4 from 1 to 488 would be floor(488/10) = 48 times, because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does 484 count? Yes, because 484 is less than 488. So, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so 488/10 = 48.8, so the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is page 488, which ends with an 8, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is page 484. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This occurs in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: from 40-49 (that's 10 numbers), 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, each block contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many blocks are there? From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, I should check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4. This occurs from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 +89=187. So, total 4's are 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the 8's, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? From 1 to 488, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48.8, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so does that add an extra? Let me see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, the units digit 8 appears 49 times. Wait, no, because 488 is the 489th number (since we start counting from 1). Wait, no, actually, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is the number of complete decades plus one if the last number is 8. Let me think differently: The first occurrence is 8, then 18, 28,..., 488. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. Solving for n: (n-1)*10 = 480 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, 49 times. So, units place: 49. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This occurs in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. So, let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, tens digit 8. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: how many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 4*10=40, and the last block 480-488 contributes 9, so total 40+9=49. So, tens place: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. This occurs from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check my calculations because 187 - 98 is 89, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the 4's or 8's. Let me go through the 4's again. 4's: units, tens, hundreds. Units: from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in units? Every 10 numbers, so 488//10=48.8, so 48 times? Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 48+50+89=187. That seems correct. Now, 8's: units place: 8,18,28,...,488. As I calculated earlier, this is 49 times. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10=40 +9=49. So, total 8's: 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, that seems correct, but I thought maybe I missed something. Let me think again. Wait, in the units place for 8's, I counted 49 times, but the last page is 488, which is included, so that's correct. Similarly, for the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, the difference is 89. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for 8's would have some numbers, but no, since the book is only 488 pages, so 800-899 doesn't exist. So, yes, the hundreds place for 8's is 0. So, the final answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the 4's count. Units: 48, tens:50, hundreds:89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. Yes. 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers.

Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\nTotal 4's = 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8 to 488. This occurs 49 times (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to include 488).\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **89**.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4, so maybe it's better to think in terms of how many times 4 appears in the units place up to 488. Alternatively, for each set of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So in every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. So, 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, does 488 include an extra 4 in the units place? Let me check: 488 is the last page, so the units digit is 8, so no, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, units place: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there up to 488? Let's see: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. How many such ranges? From 0 to 4 in the hundreds place, but let me count them. Each hundred has one such range. So, from 0-99: 40-49, that's one. Then 100-199: 140-149, another. 200-299: 240-249, another. 300-399: 340-349, another. 400-488: 440-449, another. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in terms of the hundreds digit, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. Wait, but wait, 488 is included, so yes, 89 numbers. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. Again, units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, similar to the 4's in units place, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? From 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the 48th set. So, units place: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Now, how many such ranges are there up to 488? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-489 would be another range, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, so for the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 would be from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, how many complete ranges of 10 are there? Let's count: 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9. So, that's 4 complete ranges of 10 and one partial range of 9. So, total tens place 8's: (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9. So, 4 times 10 is 40, plus 9 is 49. So, tens place: 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but since our book ends at 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, total 8's: 97. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units place: 48, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. Total: 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. That seems correct. For 8's: units place: 48, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. Total: 48 + 49 = 97. So, 187 - 97 = 90. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers. Let me confirm that: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers, correct. So, 480-488 gives 9 tens digits of 8. So, that's correct. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but wait, when I was counting the hundreds place for 4's, I considered 400-488 as 89 numbers. Let me check that: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. Correct. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. So, yes, 187 total 4's and 97 total 8's, difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges.\n   - Number of occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each complete range contributes 10 numbers, with the last range (480-488) contributing 9.\n   - Number of occurrences: (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Hmm, but since 484 is the last one, maybe it's better to think of it as the number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. So, for each ten numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, how many tens are there in 488? That's 48 full tens (since 48*10=480) and then 8 more pages. So, in each ten, 4 appears once in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place there. So, total units place 4's: 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which is the second digit. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another range. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, that's valid. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. That's pages 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. How many such numbers? Let's see, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place. Each ten has one 8 in the units place. So, how many tens are there in 488? 48 full tens, and then 8 extra pages. So, in each ten, 1 occurrence, so 48 times. But wait, in the last partial ten (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included. So, that's 49 times? Wait, because 488 is the 49th ten? Wait, no, 488 is 48*10 + 8, so the units digit 8 appears once in each ten, so from 1-10: 8, 11-20: 18, ..., 481-490: 488. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last 8 in the units place is at 488. So, how many times? Let me think: the number of 8's in the units place is equal to the number of tens. Since 488 is 48 full tens and 8 more, but since 488 is included, that's 49 times? Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th ten? Wait, no, 488 is 48*10 + 8, so the units digit 8 appears once in each ten, so from 1-10: 1, 11-20: 1, ..., 481-490: 1. But since we're only going up to 488, which is 48*10 + 8, so that's 49 occurrences? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check: for each ten, there's one 8 in the units place. So, from 1-10: 1 occurrence, 11-20: 1, ..., 481-490: 1. But since we're only going up to 488, which is within the 481-490 range, so that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is 48*10 + 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place 8's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 can appear in the tens place. That happens in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers? Wait, 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, 480-488: 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total tens place 8's: 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place 8's:49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Wait, that's 98? Wait, but earlier I thought units was 49 and tens was 49, so total 98. But let me double-check the units place. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's once every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full times, but since 488 is included, that's 49 times. So, units place:49. Tens place:49. Hundreds place:0. So total 8's:49+49=98. Now, the number of 4's was 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's. Let me recount the 4's:\n\nUnits place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. I thought it was 48, but actually, it's 49. Because 484 is the 49th term. So, units place 4's:49.\n\nTens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 ranges, 5*10=50.\n\nHundreds place:400-488. That's 89 numbers, as before.\n\nSo total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place was 48, but now I'm getting 49. Which one is correct? Let's see: from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first is 4, then 14,24,...,484. So, how many terms? Let's see, the sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The nth term is 10n -6? Wait, no, let me think differently. The first term is 4, which is 10*0 +4. The next is 14=10*1 +4, then 24=10*2 +4, ..., up to 484=10*48 +4. So, the number of terms is 49, because it starts at n=0 (4) up to n=48 (484). So, 49 terms. So, units place 4's:49.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in the units place: from 8,18,...,488. The last term is 488=10*48 +8, so n=48. So, number of terms is 49, as 8 is the first term (n=0) up to 488 (n=48). So, 49 terms.\n\nSo, earlier I was wrong about the 4's units place; it's actually 49, not 48. So, correcting that:\n\n4's:\n\n- Units:49\n\n- Tens:50\n\n- Hundreds:89\n\nTotal 4's:49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\n8's:\n\n- Units:49\n\n- Tens:49\n\n- Hundreds:0\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm confused now because earlier I thought units place 4's were 48, but now it's 49. Let me confirm with another method.\n\nAnother way to calculate the number of times a digit appears in a specific place is to consider each digit position separately.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nFor 4's:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in units place from 1 to 488:\n\nThe number of complete groups of 10 is 48 (since 488//10=48). In each group, 4 appears once. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last number, which is 48*10 +8. So, the 48th group is 480-489, but we only go up to 488. So, in the units place, 4 appears once in each group, so 48 times. Wait, but 488 is included, but 488 is 48*10 +8, so the units digit is 8, not 4. So, the 48th group (480-489) would have 484 as the last 4 in the units place. Wait, 480-489: 480,481,...,489. The units digit 4 is at 484. So, yes, that's the 48th occurrence. So, units place 4's:48.\n\nWait, but earlier when I listed the terms as 4,14,...,484, that's 49 terms because it starts at 4 (which is 10*0 +4). So, 0 to 48 inclusive is 49 terms. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, 488//10=48.8, so the integer division is 48. So, 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But in the 48th group (480-489), 484 is included, so that's the 48th occurrence. So, units place 4's:48.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: 488//10=48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. But since 488 is included, which is 48*10 +8, that's the 48th occurrence. So, units place 8's:48.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place 8's was 49. So, which is correct?\n\nLet me think again: from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place? The first is 8, then 18,28,...,488. So, the number of such numbers is equal to the number of times 8 appears in the units place, which is once every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full times, but since 488 is included, that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, because 488 is the 48th occurrence. Let me list them:\n\n8 (1),18(2),28(3),...,488(49). Wait, that's 49 terms. Because starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one more, so 488 is the 49th term. So, units place 8's:49.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in units place:4,14,24,...,484. So, 484 is the 48th term because 484=48*10 +4. So, 48 terms. So, units place 4's:48.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with the earlier method. Hmm.\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether to include the last term or not. Let me use a formula to calculate the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n.\n\nThe formula is: floor((n + 1 - d)/10). So, for d=4, n=488.\n\nfloor((488 +1 -4)/10)=floor(485/10)=48.5 floored to 48.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8: floor((488 +1 -8)/10)=floor(481/10)=48.1 floored to 48.\n\nWait, but that contradicts the earlier counting where 488 is included as the 49th occurrence for 8's. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is different. Let me check.\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is equal to:\n\nIf d > n's units digit, then it's floor(n/10). If d <= n's units digit, then it's floor(n/10) +1.\n\nWait, let's test this.\n\nFor 4's in units place, n=488, units digit is 8. Since 4 <=8, so number of 4's in units place is floor(488/10) +1=48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place, since 8<=8, number is floor(488/10)+1=48+1=49.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, units place 4's:49, units place 8's:49.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place:\n\nThe formula is similar but more complex. For the tens place, the number of times digit d appears is:\n\nLet me think. For each hundred, the digit d appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, in 0-99, 40-49 is 10 times. Similarly, in 100-199, 140-149 is 10 times, etc.\n\nSo, for 4's in tens place:\n\nNumber of hundreds in 488 is 4 (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is not a full hundred. So, for each full hundred, 10 times. So, 4 full hundreds (0-399) contribute 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 40+10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place:\n\nIn each full hundred, 80-89 is 10 numbers. So, 4 full hundreds contribute 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total 40+9=49.\n\nSo, tens place 4's:50, tens place 8's:49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor 4's in hundreds place: pages 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nFor 8's in hundreds place: since the book ends at 488, there are no pages with hundreds digit 8, so 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: units(49)+tens(50)+hundreds(89)=49+50=99+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's: units(49)+tens(49)+hundreds(0)=49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so the difference is 90.\n\nBut earlier, when I was recounting, I thought units place 4's was 48, but using the formula, it's 49. So, I think the correct total is 188 4's and 98 8's, so difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another approach. Let me list out the counts again:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place:49\n\n- Tens place:50\n\n- Hundreds place:89\n\nTotal:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n\n- Tens place:49\n\n- Hundreds place:0\n\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Number of times = floor((488 + 1 - 4) / 10) = floor(485 / 10) = 48.5 \u2192 48 times. However, since 484 is included, it's actually 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n   - Total = 5 * 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in pages 400-488.\n   - Total numbers = 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - 8 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Number of times = floor((488 + 1 - 8) / 10) = floor(481 / 10) = 48.1 \u2192 48 times. Including 488, it's 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each full range (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) contributes 10 numbers, totaling 40. The last range (400-488) contributes 9 numbers (480-488).\n   - Total = 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No pages have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.**\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Wait, that's not quite right because 484 is the 48th occurrence. Wait, let me think again. From 1 to 488, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the units place 4's go up to 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, that's 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is the 48th 4 in the units place. But actually, the 48th block ends at 480, so the 48th 4 in the units place is at 480, and then 484 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, because 480 is the 48th block, so 480 is the last number in the 48th block, so the 48th 4 in the units place is at 480. Then, 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let me see: from 1 to 480, there are 48 occurrences, and then from 481 to 488, the next 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, total 49 times? Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range. So, 480 is the 48th, and 484 is the 49th. So, units place: 49 times. Hmm, maybe I was overcomplicating earlier. Alternatively, the formula for the number of times a digit appears in the units place up to N is floor((N + 1) / 10). So, for N=488, it's (488 +1)/10 = 489/10 = 48.9, so floor is 48. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier thought. Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, the sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there? The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, (n-1)*10 = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. So, that's 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, counting the number of times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within range, but 480-489 is beyond 488, so we only go up to 488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n- 140-149: another 10 times.\n- 240-249: another 10 times.\n- 340-349: another 10 times.\n- 440-449: another 10 times.\n\nSo that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488, so yes. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but I should check if 440-449 is entirely within the book. Since the book goes up to 488, yes, 449 is less than 488, so all 10 numbers are included.\n\nSo, tens place: 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, counting the number of times 4 appears in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers.\n\nAgain, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place:** How many times does 8 appear in the units place from 1 to 488? Similar to the 4's, it's every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488.\n\nWait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488.\n\nSo, how many terms? The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488.\n\nThe nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488.\n\nSo, (n-1)*10 = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? That's in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it.\n\nSo, let's count:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n- 180-189: another 10 times.\n- 280-289: another 10 times.\n- 380-389: another 10 times.\n- 480-488: since 488 is the last page, this range is from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** How many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49+49=98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was calculating the units place for 4's, I thought maybe it was 49, but let me confirm again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then every 10 numbers. So, 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, yes, 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, it's the same: 8,18,...,488. So, 49 times.\n\nTens place for 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times.\n\nTens place for 8's: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. So, 4 full sets (each 10) and the last set is 9 numbers, so 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nHundreds place for 8's: none, so 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484), totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488), totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last range being 480-488 (9 numbers), totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as there are no page numbers \u2265800.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Hmm, so that would be 49 times because from 4 to 484, each 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place, and 484 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, actually, let me think again. The formula for counting digits in a specific place is usually (n divided by the place value) plus something if there's a remainder. For the units place, the number of times 4 appears from 1 to N is floor(N/10) + 1 if the units digit is 4 or higher. So, for N=488, the number of 4's in the units place would be floor(488/10) = 48 times, and since 488's units digit is 8, which is higher than 4, we add 1, making it 49. Wait, no, actually, when N is 488, the units digit cycles every 10, so from 1 to 480, it's 480/10=48 times, and then from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more at 484. So total 49 times. Okay, so units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there? From 0 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, from 40-49: 10 numbers, but does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 50 times. But wait, I think I might be missing something. Let me check. The first range is 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5*10=50. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. Since the book has 488 pages, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, when is the hundreds digit 4? From 400-488. Now, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But in these 89 numbers, the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? 89 times. Wait, but let me think again. Each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's: 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, the first is 8, and the last is 488. The number of terms is floor((488 - 8)/10) +1 = floor(480/10)+1=48+1=49. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 times. Alternatively, using the formula: floor(N/10) if the units digit is >=8, but since 488 ends with 8, we add 1. So, floor(488/10)=48, plus 1 if units digit >=8, which it is, so 49. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 in the tens place. This occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Now, how many such ranges are there? Let's see: 80-89: yes, within 488. 180-189: yes. 280-289: yes. 380-389: yes. 480-489: but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of this range. So, that's 5 ranges, but the last one is only 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since our book stops at 488, the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how does that affect the count? Let me think. The first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. The fifth range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, the number of times 8 appears in the tens place is 4*10 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, but wait: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers. So total is 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, tens place: 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's: 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total: 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. I had 4 ranges of 10 and one range of 9, totaling 49. Wait, but 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is another 10, 380-389 is another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 4*10 + 9=49. That's correct. So, 49 in the tens place. Units place: 49, so 49+49=98. So, 98 8's. And 4's: 188. So, difference is 90. Wait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. That's correct. So, 89 in hundreds, 50 in tens, 49 in units: 188. So, yes, the difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Maybe I should think of it as the number of times 4 appears in the units place. Since each block of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place, from 1 to 488, there are 48 full blocks of 10, and then an extra 8 numbers (481-488). Wait, no, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks and then 8 extra numbers. But in each block, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9, so each block contributes exactly one 4 in the units place. So, 48 full blocks would give 48 fours. Now, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 484 fall within these? Yes, 484 is the 4th number in this partial block (481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488). So, in the partial block, there's one more 4 in the units place. So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, how many blocks? From 0-99: 40-49 (1 block). From 100-199: 140-149 (1 block). From 200-299: 240-249 (1 block). From 300-399: 340-349 (1 block). From 400-488: 440-449 (1 block). So that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 5 x 10 = 50 fours. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but 400 is included, right? So, 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, total fours in hundreds place: 89. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times? The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, the number of 8's in the units place is the number of times 8 appears in the units digit from 1 to 488. Each block of 10 numbers contributes one 8. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, and then in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included. So, in the partial block, 488 is the last number, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more 8. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 80-89 (1 block). From 100-199: 180-189 (1 block). From 200-299: 280-289 (1 block). From 300-399: 380-389 (1 block). Now, from 400-488: The next block would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, each block contributes 10 eights, but in this last partial block, only 9 numbers are present. So, how many eights in the tens place? Let's see: For each full block (80-89, etc.), it's 10 eights. So, 4 full blocks (from 0-399) contribute 4 x 10 = 40 eights. Now, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, 9 eights in the tens place here. So, total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Total units place 4's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10 occurrences.\n   - Total tens place 4's: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in page numbers 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n   - Total hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Total units place 8's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contributing 10 occurrences. The last block (480-488) contributes 9 occurrences.\n   - Total tens place 8's: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " But since we can't have a fraction of a page, I should take the integer part. Wait, maybe a better way is to consider that from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488? That's 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. So, 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 fours. But wait, the last number is 488, which is 48*10 + 8, so the 48th set ends at 480, and then we have 481 to 488. In that last partial set, 484 is within 481-488, so that's an extra 4 in the units place. So, actually, 48 + 1 = 49 fours in the units place. Hmm, maybe my initial thought was wrong. Alternatively, the number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of times 4 appears in the units digit from 1 to 488. So, for each ten's group (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), there's exactly one 4 in the units place. How many such groups are there? From 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. Divided by 10, that's 48 full groups and a remainder of 8. So, 48 fours from the full groups, and in the last group (481-488), 484 is present, which is another 4. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 fours in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. The first is 40-49, which is in the 40s. Then 140-149, which is in the 140s, and so on. Since the book goes up to 488, the highest range with a 4 in the tens place is 440-449. So, how many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five ranges. Each contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 5*10=50 fours. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488? Yes, so all five ranges are within 1-488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers in the units place. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. The last partial set is 481-488, which includes 488, so that's another 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count these ranges. 80-89: yes, that's one. 180-189: another. 280-289: another. 380-389: another. Now, does 480-489 fall within our range? The book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the hundreds place, but the tens digit here is 8 only in 480-488, but the tens digit is 8 only for 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is actually in the 480s, so the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, but 488 is the last page. So, 480-488 is another range where the tens digit is 8. So, how many ranges? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. That's five ranges. Each of these contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one, which is only 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers? Wait, 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, for 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers. So, each of the first four ranges contributes 10 eights, and the last one contributes 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: (4*10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check again. The ranges are: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights. 180-189: 10 eights. 280-289: 10 eights. 380-389: 10 eights. 480-488: 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place, so 9 eights. So, total 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours are 188, total eights are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, so 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me think again about the units place for fours. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial cycle (481-488), 484 is present, which is another 4. So, 48+1=49. That seems correct. For the tens place, fours: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 ranges, 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place: same logic, 48 full cycles, 48 eights, and 488 is included, so 49. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four ranges gives 10 eights, and the last gives 9, so 4*10 +9=49. Hundreds place: none, so 0. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again. Is there a chance I overcounted somewhere? Let me check the hundreds place for fours: from 400 to 488. 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours. Correct. For eights, hundreds place: none, correct. Units place for fours: 49, correct. Units place for eights: 49, correct. Tens place for fours:50, correct. Tens place for eights:49, correct. So, 188 fours, 98 eights. 188-98=90. So, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but since we're dealing with whole numbers, maybe I should think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups. But wait, does 488 include a 4 in the units place? 488 ends with 8, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is within the range. So, 48 times. But wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in each set of 10, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 488 // 10 = 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction, it's 48 full times, but wait, 488 is 48*10 + 8, so actually, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48 times, because in the last partial group (481-488), 484 is included, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? Let's see: the first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, 140-149, another 10, and so on. The last block would be 440-449. Now, 488 is beyond 449, so how many blocks are there? Let's see: 40-49 (block 1), 140-149 (block 2), 240-249 (block 3), 340-349 (block 4), 440-449 (block 5). So, that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. So, total 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many times? The last occurrence is at 488, so the number of times is 488 // 10 = 48.8, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times. Wait, because from 1 to 488, the units digit 8 occurs in 8,18,...,488. The number of such numbers is 488 // 10 = 48.8, but since 488 is a whole number, it's 48 full groups plus one more (488 itself). So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences, except the last one, which contributes 9 (from 480-488). Let's see: first block 80-89: 10 numbers, 10 8's in tens place. Second block 180-189: another 10. Third block 280-289: another 10. Fourth block 380-389: another 10. Fifth block 480-488: 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, total 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800 onwards, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. So, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a page, maybe it's 48 times? Wait, let me check. From 4 to 484, the difference is 480, and each 10 pages contribute one 4. So, 480 / 10 = 48. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within that range, but 540-549 would be beyond. Let's count each block. - 40-49: that's 10 numbers, so 10 times 4 appears in the tens place. - 140-149: another 10. - 240-249: another 10. - 340-349: another 10. - 440-449: another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 times. So 5 * 10 = 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 times. Now, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, considering units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many 8's in the units place? The first is 8, the next is 18, and so on. The last one would be 488. Let me calculate how many terms there are in this sequence. The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The difference between each term is 10, so it's an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 10. The nth term is given by a_n = a_1 + (n-1)*d, where a_1=8, d=10, a_n=488. So, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 8: 480 = (n-1)*10. Divide by 10: 48 = n-1. So, n=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, let me check if these ranges are within 488. 80-89: yes, that's 10 numbers. 180-189: yes, 10. 280-289: yes, 10. 380-389: yes, 10. Now, 480-489 would be next, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this range. So, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place here? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, we have four blocks: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So total is 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. Wait, that seems correct? Let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, yes, 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: units:48, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total:187. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total:98. Difference:187-98=89. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's in the tens place. I had 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. For the 8's in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So that's 4 full blocks of 10 and one partial block of 9. 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Correct. Units place for 4: from 4,14,...,484. How many terms? Let's see, 484 is the last one. So, (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, now I'm confused. Wait, when I count from 4 to 484, stepping by 10, how many numbers? Let's see: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by saying 48. It should be 49. So, units place for 4's is 49, not 48. So, that changes the total number of 4's. So, 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)= 49+50=99; 99+89=188. So, 188 fours. Then, 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total:98. So, 188 -98=90. Wait, so I had an error in the count for 4's in the units place. Initially, I thought 48, but it's actually 49. Let me confirm. The first term is 4, which is the 1st term, then 14 is the 2nd, and so on, up to 484. The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10=484. So, (n-1)*10=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 terms. Therefore, 49 fours in the units place. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. 8's:49+49=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 89. So, I think I made a mistake in the initial count of 4's in the units place. So, the correct difference is 90. Let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I miscounted the 8's in the units place. Let me check again. For 8's in units place: starting at 8, then 18, 28,...,488. So, how many terms? The last term is 488. So, using the formula: n = ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 terms. So, 49 eights in units place. Similarly, for 4's in units place: 4,14,...,484. So, same calculation: ((484-4)/10)+1=49 terms. So, 49 fours in units place. So, 4's:49+50+89=188. 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each block contributes 10, except the last which contributes 9, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, maybe a better way is to see how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, in the last group, 480-488, the units digit goes up to 8, so 484 is within that. So, actually, the number of 4's in the units place should be 49? Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, so the units digits go from 0 to 8. So, in each ten's group, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9, but since 488 is the last page, the last group is 480-488, so the units digits go from 0 to 8. So, in the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 (from 1 to 480) plus one more at 484, making it 49. Wait, but let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many times does the units digit 4 appear? It's once every 10 numbers. So, the number of 4's in the units place is floor(488 / 10) = 48 times, plus if the last digit is 4 or beyond, but since 488 ends with 8, which is after 4, so we don't add an extra. So, 48 times. Wait, but 488 is included, so the last group is 480-488, which includes 484 as the units digit 4. So, the units digit 4 appears once in each ten's place, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, total 4's are 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears once every 10 numbers, similar to 4. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's floor(488 / 10) = 48 times. But wait, does 488 include an extra 8? Let's see: 488 is included, so the units digit 8 appears once in each ten's group, so 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the units digit 8 is in 488, so does that add an extra? Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit goes up to 8, so in the last group, 480-488, the units digits go from 0 to 8, so 8 appears once. So, total units place 8's: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488 (since 480-488 is the last part). Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last one, which only goes up to 488, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. So, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488 as 9 times, not 10. So, the tens place 8's are: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no hundreds place 8's. So, hundreds place 8's: 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48+49=97. So, total 8's are 97. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract 8's from 4's: 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems right. For 8's: units 48, tens 49, hundreds 0. 48+49=97. So, 187-97=90. Hmm, but I'm wondering if I made a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. Let me check that again. The tens digit 8 occurs in 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. So, total 8's are 48 (units) +49 (tens)=97. So, the difference is 187-97=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers.

    "text": " Wait, but since we're dealing with whole numbers, maybe it's better to think of it as the number of times 4 appears in the units place. From 1 to 488, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488? That's 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, it's 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4. So, 48 times. But wait, does the 48th block end at 480, and then from 481 to 488, the units place doesn't have a 4 again. So, yes, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set would be 440-449, because 450-459 would be beyond 488? Wait, no, 440-449 is before 450, so that's fine. Let me count how many sets of 100 there are. From 1 to 488, we have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. Each hundred has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, in each hundred, 10 numbers. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40. But wait, the last hundred is 301-400, so the next hundred would be 401-500, but our book stops at 488, so in the 400s, we have 401-488. So, in the tens place, the 4 appears in 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Wait, but earlier I thought 4 hundreds, but maybe it's better to think of it as each hundred contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 would be in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So total is 40+10=50. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds digit. So, that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but wait, 400 is the first, 401, 402,... up to 488. So, yes, 89 numbers. So, total 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, plus 89 is 187. Now, let me check that again. Units: 48, tens:50, hundreds:89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, which ends with an 8, so that's included. So, 48+1=49? Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, let's think differently. The first 8 is at 8, then every 10 after that. So, the number of 8's in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 is exactly 48*10 + 8, so it's 48+1=49. Wait, no, because 8 is the first, 18 is the second, ..., 488 is the 49th. So, yes, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which is only 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no: 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we stop at 488, it's 9 numbers. So, let's count:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 numbers\n\nSo, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, is that correct? Let me check:\n\nFrom 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in:\n\n- 80-89: 10\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nSo, 10*4=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place had 49, tens place 49, so total 98. So, number of 4's is 187, number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187-98=89.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nFirst, 4's:\n\n- Units: 48 (since 4,14,...,484). Wait, but 484 is the last one, which is 484. So, from 4 to 484, how many numbers? The formula is floor((484 - 4)/10) +1 = floor(480/10)+1=48+1=49. Wait, so earlier I thought 48, but maybe it's 49. Hmm, this is a point where I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The number of times a digit appears in the units place can be calculated as:\n\nFor digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place from 1 to n is floor(n/10) + (1 if d <= (n mod 10) else 0). Wait, but in our case, d=4.\n\nWait, let me test with n=488.\n\nNumber of 4's in units place: floor(488/10)=48, and since 4 <= 8 (the last digit of 488), we add 1, so 48+1=49. So, actually, 49 times in the units place. So, earlier I thought 48, but it's actually 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in the tens place: For each hundred, there's a block of 10 where the tens digit is 4. So, from 40-49, 140-149, etc. How many such blocks are there?\n\nFrom 1-488, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes one block of 10 where the tens digit is 4, so 4 blocks. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\nIn the hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nWait, that's different from before. Earlier I thought 48 in units, but now I'm getting 49. So, that changes the total.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits place: same logic. floor(488/10)=48, and since 8 <=8, add 1, so 49.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has a block where tens digit is 8, from 80-89, 180-189, etc. How many such blocks?\n\nFrom 1-488, we have 4 complete hundreds, each contributing a block of 10 (80-89, etc.), so 4*10=40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, total in tens place: 40+9=49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nSo, now, total 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 187-98=89, but now it's 188-98=90.\n\nI think I made a mistake in the initial count of 4's in the units place. Let me confirm:\n\nFor units digit 4:\n\nNumbers are 4,14,24,...,484.\n\nHow many terms? The first term is 4, the last term is 484. The common difference is 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens digit 4:\n\nEach block of 100 has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. So, from 1-400, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, 440-449 is another 10, so total 50.\n\nHundreds digit 4: 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits digit 8:49 times.\n\nTens digit 8:49 times.\n\nHundreds digit 8:0.\n\nTotal 8's:98.\n\nSo, difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I didn't overcount in the tens place for 8's. The tens digit 8 appears in 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488.\n\nEach of the first four blocks is 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total 40+9=49.\n\nSo, yes, 49 in tens place, 49 in units, total 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again: from 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers? It's 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nSo, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nUnits:49, tens:49. 49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 187-98=89, but now it's 90. So, the correct answer should be 90.\n\nBut let me think again: maybe I overcounted somewhere.\n\nWait, in the units place for 4's:49 times.\n\nTens place:50 times.\n\nHundreds place:89 times.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits:49.\n\nTens:49.\n\nTotal:98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the page numbers. For example, in the hundreds place, 400-488: that's 89 pages, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, 440-449:10 pages, so 10 times.\n\nIn the units place, 484 is the last one, which is included.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, 488 is included in the units place.\n\nSo, I think the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe using a formula.\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears from 1 to n can be calculated using a formula that considers each digit position separately.\n\nFor a given digit position (units, tens, hundreds), we can calculate the number of times d appears.\n\nLet me try to formalize it.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nNumber of times d appears = floor(n/10) + (1 if d <= (n mod 10) else 0).\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place:\n\nNumber of times d appears = floor(n/100) * 10 + extra.\n\nWhere extra depends on the tens digit.\n\nBut maybe it's better to use a standard digit counting method.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the formula for each digit position.\n\nLet me consider each digit position separately for both 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n1. Units place:\n\nAs above, floor(488/10)=48, and since 4 <=8, add 1, so 49.\n\n2. Tens place:\n\nWe can calculate this as:\n\nhigher = 488 // 100 =4\n\ncurrent = (488 //10) %10=8\n\nlower=488%10=8\n\nSo, for the tens digit:\n\nIf current >4: count += (higher +1)*10\n\nIf current ==4: count += (higher)*10 + lower +1\n\nIf current <4: count += higher*10\n\nSince current is 8, which is >4, so count += (4+1)*10=50.\n\nWait, so 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\n\nSimilarly, higher =488//1000=0\n\ncurrent=(488//100)%10=4\n\nlower=488%100=88\n\nIf current >4: count += (higher +1)*100\n\nIf current ==4: count += (higher)*100 + lower +1\n\nIf current <4: count += higher*100\n\nSince current is 4, which is equal to 4, so count += higher*100 + lower +1=0*100 +88+1=89.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\n1. Units place:\n\nfloor(488/10)=48, and since 8<=8, add 1, so 49.\n\n2. Tens place:\n\nhigher=488//100=4\n\ncurrent=(488//10)%10=8\n\nlower=488%10=8\n\nSince current=8>8? No, current=8, which is equal to 8.\n\nWait, no, current is 8, which is the digit we're counting, so:\n\nIf current >8: but 8 is the digit, so current=8.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nFor digit d in tens place:\n\ncount = higher * 10 + (if current >d then 10 else if current ==d then lower +1 else 0)\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently.\n\nWait, for the tens place, when counting 8's:\n\nWe can think of it as:\n\nFor each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 exactly 10 times (e.g., 80-89). But in the last partial hundred, if the tens digit is >=8, we have to count accordingly.\n\nWait, let's apply the formula properly.\n\nUsing the standard digit counting method:\n\nTo count the number of times digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to n:\n\nLet n = ABC (a 3-digit number, where A is hundreds, B is tens, C is units).\n\nThe formula is:\n\ncount = (A) * 10 + (if B > d then 1 else 0) * (if d ==0 then 9 else 1) + ... Wait, maybe it's better to use the formula as per standard digit counting.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use the method where:\n\nFor the tens place:\n\ncount = (higher) * 10\n\nif current > d: count +=10\n\nif current ==d: count += (lower +1)\n\nSo, for d=8:\n\nhigher = 4 (since 488//100=4)\n\ncurrent = (488//10)%10=8\n\nlower=488%10=8\n\nSo, count =4*10=40\n\nsince current=8 ==d=8, count += lower +1=8+1=9\n\nSo total count=40+9=49.\n\nSimilarly, for units place, as before, 49.\n\nSo, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, using the formula, we get the same result.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 187-98=89, but now it's 90. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial count, probably undercounting the units place for 4's.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n\n   - **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n     - The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n     - Number of occurrences: floor(488/10) + 1 (since 484 is included) = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - The digit '4' appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n     - Each block contributes 10 numbers. There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n     - Number of occurrences: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - The digit '4' appears in page numbers 400-488.\n     - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - The digit '8' appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n     - Number of occurrences: floor(488/10) + 1 (since 488 is included) = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - The digit '8' appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n     - Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 numbers, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 numbers.\n     - Number of occurrences: (4 * 10) + 9 = 49.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - There are no page numbers with '8' in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n     - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is the last one, so from 4 to 484, stepping by 10, that's 49 numbers because 484 is the 49th term. Wait, no, maybe I should think differently. For each set of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is the 48th set, but does it include 488? Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the 48th set ends at 480, and then the next set is 481-490, but since the book only goes up to 488, the 49th set isn't complete. So, in the units place, from 1 to 488, there are 48 times where the units digit is 4. But wait, 488 is page 488, which ends with 8, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, maybe I should calculate it as the floor of 488 divided by 10, which is 48, plus 1 if the last digit is 4 or higher. But 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, and since 488 is beyond 480, we add 1 more. So, 48 +1 =49 times. Wait, but 488 is page 488, so the units digit 4 appears at 4,14,...,484, which is 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This occurs in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges fit into 488. From 40-49: 10 numbers. 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. Now, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets of 10 numbers, each contributing 10 instances where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 x 10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, that's 10 numbers. So, 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 =89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 +89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. But wait, 488 is included, so 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's check each range: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 4 ranges with 10 each, and one range with 9. So, 4x10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in the range 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no pages with hundreds digit 8. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n- Total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This gives 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n- Total 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, that might not be the right approach. Alternatively, since every block of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place, the number of 4's in the units place is the number of complete blocks of 10. So, from 1 to 488, there are 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks. But wait, 488 is the last page, so in the units place, the 48th block would end at 480. Then, from 481 to 488, there's no 4 in the units place. So, 48 times 1 equals 48. So, 48 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 1 to 488, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count them: 40-49: that's 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place. Similarly, 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. 5 times 10 is 50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Wait, but 400 to 488: 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's are 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? From 8, 18, ..., 488. The last number is 488, which is in the units place. So, how many terms are there? The first term is 8, which is 8 = 8 + 0*10. The last term is 488 = 8 + 48*10. So, the number of terms is 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, because 8 + 48*10 = 8 + 480 = 488. So, from 0 to 48, that's 49 terms. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me check if 480-489 is included, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 380-389. So, how many blocks? 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. So, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 8's. 4 times 10 is 40. So, 40 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, total 8's are 89. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 89 (8's) = 98. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: Units place: 48, Tens:50, Hundreds:89, total 187. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:40, Hundreds:0, total 89. Difference: 187 - 89 = 98. Hmm, yes, that seems right. So, the answer should be 98 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, from 4, 14, ..., 484.

From 1 to 488, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4. That gives 48 fours. But wait, the last number is 488, which is 48 blocks of 10 (480) plus 8. So, the 48th block ends at 480, and then we have 481-488. So, in the units place, the 48th 4 is at 484, which is within the 480-489 range. So, that's correct, 48 fours in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place as part of numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, that's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50 fours. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last range, 440-449, is entirely within 488. So, that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there from 400-488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Adding up the fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total fours: 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many? From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is the 48th block plus 8. So, the last 8 in the units place is at 488, which is the 49th occurrence? Wait, no, because the first block is 1-10, which includes 8 as the 8th number. The second block is 11-20, which includes 18, and so on. So, each block of 10 contributes one 8 in the units place. So, from 1-480, that's 48 blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48 eights. Then, from 481-488, which is 8 numbers, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. The 8 in the units place is at 488. So, that's one more, making it 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. Each full range (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers, 10 eights. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: how many? From 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). The tens digit is 8 for all these, so that's 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, total fours: 187, total eights: 98. The difference is 187 - 98. Let me compute that: 187 - 98. 187 - 100 is 87, but since it's 98, which is 2 less than 100, so 87 + 2 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (one every 10 numbers).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (10 in each of 5 ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (numbers 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (one every 10 numbers, including 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (10 in each of 4 full ranges and 9 in 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

But wait, the last number is 488, so in the 48th block, it goes up to 480, and then we have 481-488, which is 8 more numbers. So, in the units place, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is within this range, adding one more 4. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, right? So yes, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. The first is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. That would be from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 49, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so in the last block, 481-488, the units digit 8 is at 488, so that's one more. So total units place 8's are 48 +1=49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such ranges there are. 80-89 is the first, then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40 times. Now, does 480-489 fall within 488? 480-489 would be another range, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 in 480-488 is present, but only up to 488. So, 480-488 has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (480-488). So, that's 9 more. So, total tens place 8's would be 4*10 +9=49. Wait, let me confirm. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, the number of 4's is 188 and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have overcounted. Let me recount the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\n- Units place:8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488-8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 ranges, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: none, since 800>488. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a big difference. Let me think if I missed anything. For the 4's in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct because 488-400+1=89. For the 8's in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), each with an 8 in the tens place. So, yes, that's 9. So, I think my counts are correct. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None (since 800 > 488) \u2192 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should check by seeing how many times 4 appears in the units place. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in each set of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, how many sets of 10 are there in 488? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then an extra 8 numbers (481-488) where 484 is another 4 in the units place. Wait, so that would be 48 times plus one more, making it 49 times? Let me check: from 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of 10, so 48 times 4 in the units place. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is another occurrence. So yes, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each of these blocks of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 1 to 488, we have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. Wait, actually, from 1 to 488, the hundreds are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Each hundred block has a 40-49 block, so that's 10 times per hundred. So, 4 hundreds would have 4 times 10, which is 40. But wait, the last block is only up to 488, so from 401-488, the 40-49 block would be 440-449, right? So that's another 10 occurrences. Wait, but 401-488 includes 400-488, so the 40-49 in the hundreds place would be 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's another 10. So, total in the tens place would be 4 (from each hundred) times 10, which is 40, plus another 10 from 440-449, making it 50? Wait, that can't be right because 400-488 is part of the 400s, so the 40-49 in the tens place would be 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, each hundred contributes 10, and there are 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40, plus the 440-449, which is another 10, so total 50? Wait, but 400-488 is only 88 numbers, so does that affect the count? Hmm, no, because the 440-449 is entirely within 400-488, so it's 10 numbers, so total 50 in the tens place. Wait, but 400-488 is part of the 400s, so the 40-49 in the tens place would be 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's included. So, in each hundred, it's 10, and there are 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40, plus 10 from 440-449, making it 50. Wait, that seems too high. Let me think again. From 1-100: 40-49: 10 times. 101-200: 140-149: 10 times. 201-300: 240-249: 10 times. 301-400: 340-349: 10 times. Then 401-488: 440-449: 10 times. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 times in the tens place. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place, which would be from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times? From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then an extra 8 in 488. So, that would be 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. So, each hundred block contributes 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. From 1-100: 80-89: 10 times. 101-200: 180-189: 10 times. 201-300: 280-289: 10 times. 301-400: 380-389: 10 times. Then 401-488: 480-488: which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 9 times. So, total in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, giving 89 occurrences.\n  \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = **188**.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, that's not exact. Maybe a better way is to consider that every 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4. So that's 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so in the last set (480-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is included. So yes, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such ranges are there up to 488? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so that's 5 * 10 = 50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. So, pages 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So there are 187 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times? From 1 to 488, how many multiples of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so in the last set, 480-488, the units digit 8 is at 488, so yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. Each full range (like 80-89) contributes 10 times, but the last one (480-488) only contributes 9 times because 489 isn't included. So, how many full ranges are there? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four full ranges, each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40. Then, the last partial range 480-488 contributes 9 times (480, 481, ..., 488). So total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. Now, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 97. So, the difference is 187 - 97 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears from 400 to 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 times.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Full ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 \u2192 4 ranges, each contributing 10 occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Partial range 480-488 contributes 9 occurrences (480-488).\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No pages have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me count these. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, etc.) has a 40-49 block. So, how many hundreds are there? Up to 400, so 4 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is not a full hundred. Let me check: 400-488 is 89 pages. So, in the tens place, the 4 appears in 40-49 (10 times), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 times. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 times, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up the units, tens, and hundreds places: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many times? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49 times. Wait, let me check: 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count these. Each hundred block has a 80-89 block. From 1-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). Now, 400-488: The next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of this. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, for 400-488, it's 9 times. So, adding up: 4 blocks of 10 (from 80-89, etc.) and then 9 in the last partial block. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49 times in the tens place. Wait, but wait, 80-89 is in 1-99, which is 10. 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, that's 4 full blocks and a partial one. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above. But since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up the units, tens, and hundreds places for 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) -98 (number of 8's)=89. So, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10th number, totaling 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449, each block contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is every 10th number, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks each contribute 10, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book doesn't reach 800.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Wait, but since 484 is included, maybe it's better to think in terms of how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full tens (1-480) and then 8 more numbers (481-488). So, in each full ten, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9, so each digit, including 4, appears once every 10 numbers. So, for the units place, the number of 4's would be the number of complete tens, which is 48, plus whether the remaining 8 numbers include a 4. Since 481-488: the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 484 is included, which is the 48th set plus one more 4. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49? Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. From 1 to 480, there are 480 numbers. Each 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place, so 480 / 10 = 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, that's 8 numbers. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, the 4 in the units place occurs once more at 484. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the blocks are: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This would be in the range 400-488. Each number here has a hundreds digit of 4. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? The first occurrence is 8, then 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, and then check the remaining 8 numbers (481-488). The units digits in 481-488 are 1-8, so 488 is included, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 48 + 1 = 49 8's in units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8's in the tens place occur in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488? Let's see: 80-89 is one, 180-189 is two, 280-289 is three, 380-389 is four. The next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the tens place 8's in 480-488 are only 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, each block of 100 contributes one block of 10 8's, except maybe the last one. Wait, let me think again. From 1-488, the blocks where tens digit is 8 are: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers). So, that's 4 full blocks of 10, and one partial block of 9. So, total 4*10 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. Wait, but wait: 80-89 is 10 numbers, so 10 8's in tens place. Similarly, 180-189 is another 10, so 10 each for 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (4, 14, ..., 484)\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449)\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488)\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (8, 18, ..., 488)\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488)\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence because 48*10 + 4 = 484. So, there are 48 4's in the units place. But wait, does 484 count as one? Yes, because 484 is within 488. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50 4's in the tens place. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's fine. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 here, so how many numbers? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, no. Wait, each number in 400-488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so the number of 4's in the hundreds place is 89. So, total 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Now, let me check if I did that correctly. Units: 4,14,...,484: that's 48 numbers. Tens: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). So that's 5*10=50. Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89. So total 4's: 48+50+89=187. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. How many such numbers? The last number is 488, which is 488/10 = 48.8, so the number of 8's in the units place is 48. Wait, but 488 is included, so 488 is the 49th occurrence? Wait, let's see: 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The first term is 8=8*1, the second is 18=8*2 + 10? Wait, no, perhaps better to think of it as starting at 8 and adding 10 each time. So, the nth term is 8 + 10*(n-1). We want the last term <=488. So, 8 +10*(n-1) <=488. So, 10*(n-1) <=480, so n-1 <=48, so n<=49. So, n=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. Wait, but 488 is 8 +10*48=488, so that's the 49th term. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count: From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4 ranges with 10 each (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) and one range with 9 numbers (480-488). So, 4*10 +9=49 8's in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480 +1=9. So, yes, 9. So, total tens place 8's:4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units:48, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total:48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total:49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Wait, but maybe a better way is to calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 48 times 10 is 480, so up to 480, there are 48 4's in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digit doesn't reach 4 again, so total units place 4's are 48. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, for 10 numbers each time. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such ranges are there up to 488? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five ranges. Each contributes 10 4's, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, total 4's printed are 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,... up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many 8's in the units place? Similar to the 4's, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8. So, 48 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, for 10 numbers each time. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each range contributes 10 8's. How many such ranges are there up to 488? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four ranges, each with 10 8's, so 4*10=40. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 48+40=88. So, total 8's printed are 88. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 88 = 99.

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction, maybe I should think of it as (484 - 4)/10 + 1. So, (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does 484 exist? Yes, because 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers.

So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. Each page number here starts with 4. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many? Using the same method: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, how many blocks? From 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's.

    "text": " Wait, but since 484 is the last one, maybe it's better to calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. The pattern repeats every 10 numbers, so in each block of 10, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last block is 480-488, which includes 484 as the 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? Let's see: from 1 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 would go up to 449, which is less than 488, so that's fine. So that's five blocks, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times. But wait, let me check: 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10. That's 5\u00d710=50. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But in these, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers. So, that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many? From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? Each block of 10 has one such number. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included, which is the 48th occurrence? Wait, no. Let me think: 8 is the first, 18 the second, ..., 488 is the 49th? Because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8. Wait, 8\u00d71=8, 8\u00d72=16, etc., but that's not the way. Alternatively, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? It's the floor of (488)/10) +1 if 488 mod 10 >=8. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, but since 488 ends with 8, it's 48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such blocks are there up to 488. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10. That's four blocks, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 4\u00d710=40 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, zero times in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49+40=89. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 89 (number of 8's) = 98. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: units: 48, tens:50, hundreds:89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units:49, tens:40, hundreds:0. 49+40=89. 187-89=98. So, 98 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, let me check if I counted correctly for the units place of 8's. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, 28,...,488. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, yes, 49 times. Similarly, for 4's in the units place, from 4,14,...,484. The last term is 484, which is 4 + (n-1)*10=484. So, n-1=(484-4)/10=480/10=48, so n=49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, this is a discrepancy. Wait, if the first term is 4, the next is 14, ..., last term is 484. So, how many terms? Let's see: 484-4=480, divided by 10 is 48, so number of terms is 48+1=49. So, units place for 4's is 49, not 48 as I initially thought. So, I must have made a mistake earlier. Similarly, for 8's, units place is 49. So, let me correct that. So, units place for 4's: 49 times. Then, tens place: as before, 5 blocks (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449). Each block has 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so hundreds digit is 4, 89 times. So, total 4's: 49+50+89= 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Wait, so 188 4's. Now, for 8's: units place is 49, tens place is 40, hundreds place 0. So, 49+40=89. So, the difference is 188-89=99. Hmm, so I think I initially undercounted the units place for 4's. So, the correct number of 4's is 188, 8's is 89, difference is 99. Wait, but let me confirm again. For 4's in units place: from 4 to 484, step 10. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. So, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units:49, tens:40, hundreds:0. 49+40=89. So, 188-89=99. So, the correct answer should be 99 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but earlier I thought 98, but that was because I had miscounted the units place for 4's as 48 instead of 49. So, the correct difference is 99. Let me just make sure I didn't make any other mistakes. Let me recount the 4's in the tens place. The ranges are 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's five ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units:49, tens:40, correct. So, 89. So, 188-89=99. So, the answer is 99 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly the hundreds place for 4's? 400-488 is 89 numbers. Yes, because 488-400+1=89. So, correct. So, yes, I think 99 is the right answer. I must have initially miscounted the units place for 4's as 48 instead of 49, which led to the initial incorrect difference of 98. After correcting that, it's 99.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range has 10 numbers, so 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Pages 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389.\n   - Each range has 10 numbers, so 4 ranges \u00d7 10 = 40 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No pages in 800-899, so 0 times.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 89.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 89 (number of 8's) = 99.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{99}."

    "text": " Wait, maybe a better way is to calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete tens, which is 48 full tens (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8). But wait, actually, for each ten, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9, so in each ten, 4 appears once. So, from 1 to 480, there are 48 tens, so 48 times 4 in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. So total 4's in units place: 48. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149 is another 10, and so on. Since the book goes up to 488, the last block is 440-449. So how many blocks are there? Let's see: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So total 4's in the tens place: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place as 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Wait, but I'm only counting the hundreds digit here, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So total 4's in hundreds place: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. How many times does 8 appear in the units place? From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8). Each full ten contributes one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial ten (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so that's one more 8. So total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place as 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Wait, but 380-389 is within 488, so that's fine. So total 8's in tens place: 40. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place as 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, no 8's in the hundreds place. So total 8's in hundreds place: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, total 8's: 89. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 89 (number of 8's) = 98. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units place: 48, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. Total: 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. For 8's: units place: 49, tens place:40, hundreds place:0. Total: 49+40=89. So, 187-89=98. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in counting the units place for 4's. Let me check again. Units place for 4's: from 4,14,24,...,484. The last number is 484, which is 48*10 +4, so the count is 48 times. Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence? Let me see: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, actually, the units place for 4's is 49 times, not 48. Because starting at 4, every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by thinking it was 48, but it's actually 49. So, units place for 4's is 49. Similarly, for 8's in the units place: from 8,18,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 48*10 +8, so number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place for 8's is 49, which is correct. Now, let's correct the count for 4's. So, units place:49, tens place:50, hundreds place:89. Total 4's:49+50=99, 99+89=188. Wait, that's 188, not 187 as I thought earlier. So, I had an error in the units place for 4's, which increased the total by 1, making it 188. Now, let's check the 8's again. Units place:49, tens place:40, hundreds place:0. Total 8's:89. So, the difference is 188 -89=99. Hmm, so I think I made a mistake in the initial count for 4's in the units place. Let me confirm again. For 4's in units place: numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place:49. Tens place: as before, 5 blocks (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449). Each block has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Hundreds place: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place:49, tens place:4 blocks (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389), each 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Hundreds place:0. Total 8's:49+40=89. So, the difference is 188-89=99. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 98, but now it's 99. So, I think I need to make sure. Let me recount the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 -400 +1=89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 times. That's correct. So, total 4's:188, 8's:89. Difference:99. But wait, let me check if 488 is included in the hundreds place count. Yes, because 488 is in 400-488, so it's included. Now, let me check the 8's in the tens place. 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. So, 4 blocks, 10 each, 40. So, 40 8's in the tens place. Units place:49, as before. So, 89 total 8's. So, 188-89=99. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the answer was 98, but now it's 99. Let me see where I might have gone wrong. Wait, in the 4's units place, I thought it was 49, but earlier I thought it was 48. Let me confirm with a different approach. How many times does 4 appear in the units place? From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, starting at 4. So, 4,14,24,...,484. Now, 484 is the last one before 488. So, how many terms? The first term is 4 (n=1), then 14 (n=2), ..., 484 (n=k). The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 4 + (k-1)*10 =484. So, (k-1)*10=480, so k-1=48, so k=49. So, 49 terms. So, units place for 4's is 49. So, that's correct. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. 8's:49+40=89. Difference:99. So, the answer should be 99. But wait, let me check the 4's in the tens place again. The blocks are 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, that's correct. Now, the hundreds place:400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. 8's:49 (units)+40 (tens)=89. So, 188-89=99.

    "text": " Wait, maybe a better way is to calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. Since every 10 numbers have exactly one 4 in the units place, the total number of 4's in the units place is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, I think it's 48 times, but maybe I should check. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full cycles with 8 remaining numbers (481-488). Each cycle contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 4 in the units place would be at 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers) From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers) From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers) From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, does the last block go up to 449? Yes, because 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This happens from page 400 to page 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full times, but let's check. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the 48th occurrence in the units place. So 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 8's in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers) From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers) From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). Now, from 400-488, the next block would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, we only go up to 488. So, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So in the tens place, from 400-488, the 8's in the tens place occur 9 times. So total for the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So 4*10 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, but let me think again. From 0-399, each hundred has a block of 10, so 4 blocks, 4*10=40. Then from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 49 + 0 = 97. Now, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 times (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 times (e.g., 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = **187**.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 times (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 times.\n\nTotal 8's: 48 + 49 + 0 = **97**.\n\nDifference: 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, maybe a better way is to consider how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488. So, from 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490). But 490 is beyond 488, so actually, up to 480, which is 48*10. So, from 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the units place goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is included. So, that's one more 4 in the units place. So total in units place: 48 +1 = 49. Wait, but wait, from 1 to 480, each 10 numbers have exactly one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's: 48 +1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges are within 488. The first is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Wait, but in the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many? From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? It's the same as the number of times 8 appears in the units place. So, every 10 numbers, there's one 8. So, from 1 to 480, that's 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 is included. So, that's one more 8 in the units place. So total units place 8's: 48 +1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but 480-489 is up to 488, so that's 9 numbers (480-488). Let me count how many such ranges are within 488. The first is 80-89 (10 numbers), then 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers). So, that's 4 full ranges of 10, and one partial range of 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but wait, our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98. Wait, that's 49+49=98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the tens place for 4's again. I thought there were 5 ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 50. That seems right. For 8's in the tens place, I had 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one partial range (480-488). Each full range is 10 numbers, so 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. That seems correct. Units place for both 4 and 8: 49 each. So, 4's total 188, 8's total 98. Difference is 90. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:**\n   - Subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but since 484 is included, maybe it's better to calculate it as (484 - 4)/10 + 1. So, (484 - 4) = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, for 10 numbers each time. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Let me check how many such groups there are. The first group is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10. Continuing up to 440-449. Since the book goes up to 488, the last group would be 440-449. How many groups are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one group. Then 100-199: 140-149. 200-299: 240-249. 300-399: 340-349. 400-488: 440-449. So that's 5 groups, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So 5 * 10 = 50. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because when counting digits, each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's printed: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. The first is 8, last is 488. So, how many terms? The formula is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1. (488 - 8) = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, for 10 numbers each time. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last group is 480-488, which is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, let's count the number of groups. From 0-99: 80-89, that's 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189, another 10. 200-299: 280-289, 10. 300-399: 380-389, 10. 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total groups: 4 full groups (each 10) and one partial group (9). So, total 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. Wait, but let me check again. From 0-99: 80-89 is 10. 100-199: 180-189 is 10. 200-299: 280-289 is 10. 300-399: 380-389 is 10. 400-488: 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in groups like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Number of groups: 5 (from 40-49 up to 440-449).\n   - Each group contributes 10 occurrences, so 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in groups like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Number of full groups: 4 (each contributing 10 occurrences).\n   - Partial group (480-488): 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, for the units place, every 10 numbers have exactly one 4. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10 and an extra 8 numbers. But since we're only interested in the units digit, each group contributes one 4. So, 48 times one 4, which is 48. But wait, 488 is the last page. Let me check if 488 is included. The units digit of 488 is 8, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 48th group. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers long, and each contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's five ranges, each contributing 10 4's. So, 5 times 10 is 50. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but does 449 go beyond 488? No, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 4's in total.

Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), so that's a partial range. Let's count each full range first: 80-89: 10 numbers, contributing 10 8's. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Then, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place, that's 4 full ranges (each 10) and one partial range of 9. So, 4*10 = 40, plus 9, totaling 49 8's in the tens place. Wait, but wait: 480-488 is 9 numbers, but each of those has an 8 in the tens place. So, that's correct. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit can't be 8. So, no 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's.

So, yes, 48 times for the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. Starting from 40-49, that's one range. Then 140-149, another. 240-249, another. 340-349, another. 440-449, another. So that's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? Let me check: 440-449 is within 488, so yes, all 5 ranges are valid. So, 50 times for the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But we're only interested in the hundreds digit, which is 4 for all these numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these 89 numbers. Therefore, 89 times for the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the 8 in the units place. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10 each time. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets. So, 48 times for the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 4 ranges of 10 and one range of 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times. Therefore, total number of 8's is 48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) minus 97 (number of 8's) equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in numbers 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n**Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any page number.\n**Total 8's:** 48 + 49 + 0 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, maybe a better way is to consider that from 1 to 488, how many times does each digit from 0-9 appear in the units place? For each complete set of 10 numbers, each digit appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full sets, and then there are 8 remaining numbers (481-488). So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times, and in the remaining 8 numbers, does 484 have a 4 in the units place? Yes, 484 is included in the 481-488 range, so that adds one more. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, no, maybe that's not the right way. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete decades (10s) times 1, plus any extra in the incomplete decade. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 times 1 for each decade, so 48, and then in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484). So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, is that correct? Let me check. The first range is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10, and so on. So yes, 5 ranges, 10 each, so 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Hmm, okay, maybe that's correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's count how many. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Each decade (10 numbers) has one 8 in the units place. 488 divided by 10 is 48 full decades, with 8 remaining numbers (481-488). So, 48 times from the full decades, and in the last 8 numbers, 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. The ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, each of these ranges except the last one contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-488: 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, how many 8's? Each of the first four ranges gives 10, so 4*10=40, and the last partial range (480-488) gives 9 8's in the tens place (since 480-488 have 8 in the tens place). So total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8 in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 in the numbers 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. So total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, for 4's: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total:188. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total:98. Difference:188-98=90. Hmm, maybe that's correct. But let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct. For 8's, in the tens place, I had 4 full decades (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each giving 10 8's, so 40, plus 480-488 giving 9 more, totaling 49. Units place: same as 4's, 49. So 98 in total. So 188-98=90. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades (480 numbers) and 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n   - In each decade, 4 appears once in the units place: 48 times.\n   - In the extra numbers (481-488), 4 appears once (484).\n   - Total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences: 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - This is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**\n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades and 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n   - In each decade, 8 appears once: 48 times.\n   - In the extra numbers, 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges each contribute 10 occurrences: 4 ranges \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - The range 480-488 contributes 9 occurrences (480-488).\n   - Total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**\n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"
