    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 484 is actually the 49th occurrence because starting from 0, the first 4 is at 4, which is the 1st occurrence, then 14 is the 2nd, and so on, up to 484 being the 49th. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as (484 - 4)/10 + 1. Let me calculate that: (484 - 4) is 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. Wait, but does 488 have a 4 in the units place? 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, 488's units digit is 8, not 4. So, the last 4 in the units place is indeed 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, which is 10 numbers. Then 100-199: 140-149 is another range, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, how many ranges is that? 0-99: 1 range, 100-199: 1, 200-299:1, 300-399:1, 400-488:1 (since 440-449 is within 400-488). So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's. Wait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first, 401, 402,... up to 488. So, from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's printed: 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll count the number of 8's in units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. Starting from 8, 18, 28,... up to 488. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. Let me calculate how many 8's are there in the units place. Using the same method: (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8's in the tens place. This occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. Let me count the number of such ranges. From 0-99: 80-89 is one range, 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189, another 10. 200-299: 280-289, another 10. 300-399: 380-389, another 10. 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9. So, the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 numbers, contributing 4*10=40. Then, the last range 480-488 has 9 numbers. So, total 40 +9=49 8's in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is another 10, 380-389 is another 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total 8's printed:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yep, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 such numbers.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as page numbers don't reach 800.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Taking the integer part, that's 48, but since 484 is exactly 48*10 + 4, I think it's 49 times? Wait, no, because 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4, so maybe it's 49? Let me check: from 4 to 484, that's 484/10 = 48.4, so 48 full tens, but since 484 is included, it's 49 times. Wait, no, maybe it's 49 because 484 is the 49th term? Hmm, maybe I should think differently. For numbers up to N, the count of a digit d in the units place is floor(N/10). So, for 488, floor(488/10) = 48. So, 48 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 would be beyond 488? No, 440-449 is within 488, right? So, each hundred has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many hundreds are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, for 0-99, 40-49: 10 numbers. For 100-199, 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 5 sets. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: from 40 to 449, that's 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, total 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. Now, let me check if I did that right. Units: 48, tens:50, hundreds:89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 4's. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many? Using the same method: floor(488/10) = 48. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. So, how many sets of 10? Let's see: 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189: 10. 200-299: 280-289:10. 300-399: 380-389:10. 400-488: 480-488: how many? 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. Wait, but let me think again. Each hundred except the last one has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. The last hundred (400-488) has 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4 hundreds with 10 each and 1 with 9, so 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 8 only from 800-899, which is beyond 488. So, no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (48) + tens (49) = 97. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check the counts. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units 48, tens 49. 48+49=97. 187-97=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 times.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each hundred has 10 such numbers, and there are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in numbers 400-488, which is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers. For example, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 times.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each hundred has 10 such numbers, except the last hundred (400-488), which has 480-488 (9 numbers). So, 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 48 (units) + 49 (tens) = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Taking the integer part, that's 48 times. Wait, but 484 is the 49th occurrence because 484 is the 49th multiple of 10. Let me check: 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so there are 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, does 484 count as the 49th? Let me see: 484 is 48*10 + 4, so yes, it's the 49th occurrence. So, the units place has 49 fours. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does 484 exist? Yes, because 484 is less than 488. So, 49 fours in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, there's a 4 in the tens place for 10 numbers. How many hundreds do we have? From 0-488, that's 5 hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 is only 88 numbers, so does that affect the count? Let's see. For the tens place, in each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers. But in the last hundred, 400-488, the tens digit can be 4 for numbers 440-449, which is 10 numbers, and 450-459, etc., but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 hundreds would contribute 5*10=50 fours. Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so the last hundred is 400-488, which is 89 numbers. But the tens digit still cycles normally up to 480, so 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 hundreds, each contributing 10 fours, so 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 49 fours. Tens place: 50 fours. Hundreds place: 89 fours. So, 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many? The last occurrence is 488, which is 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 is 48*10 + 8. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one, which is 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, let's count: 80-89: 10 eights. 180-189: 10 eights. 280-289: 10 eights. 380-389: 10 eights. 480-488: 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Therefore, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours: 188, total eights: 98. Difference: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check the counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4 to 484.

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 484 is the 49th occurrence because 484 is the 49th multiple of 10 when counting from 4. Let me verify: 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48 times. Wait, no, that's not right. Because from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each complete set of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of 4's in the units place would be the total number of complete decades (sets of 10) in 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4. So, 48 times. But wait, does 488 include an extra 4? Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, meaning 48 complete sets, each contributing a 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there? From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, there's a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440 is 440, which is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 40-49: 10 numbers, 4 in tens place. 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's. Wait, but 488 is included, so 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. So, 48 times. But wait, does 488 count? 488 is included, so 488 is the 49th occurrence? Wait, let me think: the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, the number of 8's in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48. But wait, 488 is 48*10 + 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 when counting from 8. Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. So, which is correct? Let me think again: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The number of such numbers is equal to the number of times 8 appears in the units place. The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 can appear in the tens place. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, there's a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-489 would be the next, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 includes numbers where the tens digit is 8, but only up to 488. So, how many numbers are there from 480 to 488 where the tens digit is 8? The tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. Wait, but the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, in the hundreds place, 480-488 is part of the 400s, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers here. So, let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, total 10+10+10+10+9=49 8's in the tens place. Wait, but wait: 80-89 is 10 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189 is another 10, and so on. So, 4 sets of 10, which is 40, plus the 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Wait, but let me check again: units place was 49, tens place was 49, so total 49 + 49 = 98 8's. Wait, but earlier I thought units place was 49 and tens place was 49, so total 98. Now, the number of 4's was 187, and 8's is 98. So, the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89. But wait, let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, let me go back to the 4's count. I had units:48, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 187. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, total 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. But let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the 4's in the tens place. I thought it was 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me list them: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That seems correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nFor the 8's in the tens place, I had 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). That's 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nUnits place for 4's: from 4,14,...,484. How many? 488/10=48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4. So, 48. But wait, 484 is included, which is the 49th occurrence? Wait, no, because 484 is the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 4. Let me think: 4 is the first, 14 the second, ..., 484 is the (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49th occurrence. So, units place for 4's is 49, not 48. Wait, so I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, for 4's in the units place: from 4 to 484, the number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 4's in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, as I correctly calculated earlier, it's 49.\n\nSo, correcting the 4's count:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:50\n\nHundreds:89\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nWait, 49+50=99, plus 89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:49\n\nTotal:98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought 4's were 187, but actually, it's 188. Let me confirm:\n\n4's:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:50\n\nHundreds:89\n\nTotal:49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\n8's:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:49\n\nTotal:98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 187, but that was because I had units as 48, which was incorrect. So, the correct count is 4's=188, 8's=98, difference=90.\n\nBut wait, let me check again the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 4's:188\n\n8's:98\n\nDifference:90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count any numbers. For example, in the tens place, 440-449: these numbers have 4 in both tens and hundreds place, but each digit is counted separately. So, 440 has a 4 in hundreds, a 4 in tens, and a 0 in units. So, each digit is counted in its respective place.\n\nSimilarly, 488 has 4 in hundreds, 8 in tens, and 8 in units.\n\nSo, the counts are correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer was 89, but after correcting the units place for 4's, it's 90. Let me just make sure.\n\nYes, units place for 4's:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nUnits place for 8's:49, tens:49. 49+49=98.\n\n188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check once more for the 4's in the units place. From 4 to 484, how many numbers? The first is 4, then 14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 terms. So, 49 4's in units place.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: from 8 to 488, step 10. Number of terms: (488 -8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 8's in units place.\n\nTens place for 4's: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50.\n\nTens place for 8's:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. The first four are 10 each, and the last is 9. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place for 4's:400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nHundreds place for 8's: none, since the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, 4's total:49+50+89=188.\n\n8's total:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer is 90.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the initial count for 4's in the units place. Let me confirm again.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nThe numbers are 4,14,24,...,484.\n\nThe number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49.\n\nSo, 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place:8,18,...,488.\n\nNumber of terms: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49.\n\nSo, 49 times.\n\nSo, 4's in units:49, 8's in units:49.\n\nTens place for 4's:5 sets of 10, 5*10=50.\n\nTens place for 8's:4 sets of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) and 9 numbers in 480-488, total 49.\n\nHundreds place for 4's:89 numbers.\n\nSo, 4's total:49+50+89=188.\n\n8's total:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers is calculated by considering each digit position (units, tens, hundreds). Similarly, the number of times 8 appears is counted. \n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49 occurrences (4, 14, ..., 484)\n- Tens place: 50 occurrences (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449)\n- Hundreds place: 89 occurrences (400-488)\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49 occurrences (8, 18, ..., 488)\n- Tens place: 49 occurrences (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488)\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Taking the integer part, that's 48. But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so the integer part is 48, but actually, 484 is the 49th number because it starts counting from 0. Hmm, maybe I should think differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place up to N is equal to the floor of N divided by 10, plus one if the digit is less than or equal to the units digit of N. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me see: For units place, the number of 4's is the number of complete tens in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete tens. Each ten contributes one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete tens, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, let's check: 4,14,24,...,484. 484 is the 49th occurrence because 484 is 48*10 +4, so 48 full tens plus one more. Wait, no, 484 is the 49th number because from 1 to 484, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 484/10 = 48.4, so 48 full tens, and then the 49th is 484. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, the number of 4's in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48, but wait, 488 is 48*10 + 8, so the 48th ten ends at 480, and then from 481 to 488, the next ten would be 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the units place 4's in this range would be 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, actually, it's 48 complete tens, each contributing one 4, plus one more in 484, making it 49. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range, so yes, 49 times. Hmm, maybe I should use a formula. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N is equal to (N + 1) // 10 if d is 0, but for other digits, it's floor((N + 1) / 10). Wait, no, let me think again. For units digit, the number of times 4 appears is the number of times 4 is in the units place from 1 to N. So, for each 10 numbers, it appears once. So, up to N, it's floor(N / 10) if N mod 10 >=4, else floor(N /10). Wait, no, actually, it's (N // 10) if the units digit is less than 4, else (N // 10) +1. Wait, no, maybe it's better to think that for units digit, the number of times 4 appears is (N + 1) // 10 if the units digit is >=4, else (N) //10. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me take an example. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first 4 is at 4, then every 10 numbers: 14,24,...,484. So, how many such numbers? Let's see: The first is 4, which is 4 = 1*10 -6. Wait, maybe better to see that the number of 4's in units place is equal to the number of complete decades (tens) plus one if the current decade has a 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades. Each contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48. Then, in the last partial decade, which is 481-488, does 484 have a 4 in the units place? Yes, 484 is within 481-488, so that's one more. So total is 48 +1 =49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449, and maybe 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488. So, each hundred has a set of ten numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many hundreds we have. From 1-99: 40-49 is one set, so 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 400-488. Here, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, 410-419, etc., but wait, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, 480-488. Wait, no, that's not right. The tens digit is 4 when the tens place is 4, so in 400-409, the tens digit is 0, not 4. Wait, no, wait: 400-409: hundreds digit is 4, tens digit is 0. So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, 450-459? No, wait, no. Wait, the tens digit is the second digit from the right. So, in 400-409, the tens digit is 0. In 410-419, it's 1, and so on. So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. But wait, 440-449: yes, that's correct. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449. So, how many numbers is that? 10 numbers: 440-449. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 449 is within the range. So, that's 10 numbers. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? From 1-99: 40-49, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, 10. From 200-299: 240-249, 10. From 300-399: 340-349, 10. From 400-488: 440-449, 10. So, that's 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 5 sets. So, total 50 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400-488. The tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's correct. So, 10 in 400-488, plus 10 in each previous hundred, so 4*10=40, plus 10 more in 400-488, total 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 +89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's: units, tens, hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place:** How many times does 8 appear in the units place from 1 to 488? Similar to 4's, it's every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete tens. Each contributes one 8 in the units place. Then, in the last partial decade, 481-488, 488 is included, so that's one more. So, 48 +1=49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** How many times does 8 appear in the tens place? It's in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488: the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, let's count:\n\n- 80-89:10 numbers\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, hundreds digit 8 never occurs. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. For 480-488, the tens digit is 8, right? So, 480 is 8 in the tens place, 481 is 8, up to 488. So, that's 9 numbers. So, yes, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times in the tens place for 8's.\n\nSo, total 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting, we find that there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Taking the integer part, that's 48. But wait, 484 is the 49th occurrence because 484 is the 49th multiple of 10 (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, but we include the 484). Hmm, maybe a better way is to calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place up to 488. The formula is floor((488 - 4)/10) + 1. Let me compute that: (488 - 4) is 484, divided by 10 is 48.4, floor is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within range, but 480-489 would include 480-488. Wait, but I'm considering the tens place, so 4 in the tens place would be from 40-49, 140-149, etc. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then, each subsequent hundred would have another 10 numbers. So, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. But wait, I need to check if 440-449 is within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is 488. Using the same method as before: (488 - 8)/10 = 480/10 = 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. That's 5 blocks. Each block from 80-89, etc., has 10 numbers, except the last one, 480-488, which has 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, the first four blocks contribute 4\u00d710=40, and the last block contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488 (9 numbers). Total is 40 + 9 = 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence, right? Because 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, units place gives me 48 fours. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within the range. Let me count how many such groups there are. Each group is 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 fours in the tens place. How many groups are there? The first group is 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so that's one group. Then 140-149, that's another, and so on. The last group would be 440-449, which is still within 488. So, how many groups? Let's see: 40-49 (1), 140-149 (2), 240-249 (3), 340-349 (4), 440-449 (5). So that's 5 groups. Each group contributes 10 fours, so 5*10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? Well, 488 minus 400 is 88, but since both endpoints are included, it's 89 numbers. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's printed are 187. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 8. Let me check: 8 is the first, 18 is the second, ..., 488 is the (488 / 10) + 1? Wait, no. Actually, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 itself is the 49th occurrence because 8 is in the units place of 488. So, I think it's 49 times. Wait, let me think again. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of 8's in the units place is floor(488 / 10) + 1 if 488 mod 10 is 8. Since 488 mod 10 is 8, yes, so it's 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place gives 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last group is 480-488. Let me count the number of such groups. Each group is 10 numbers, except the last one which is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, the first group is 80-89 (10 numbers), second is 180-189 (10), third is 280-289 (10), fourth is 380-389 (10), and fifth is 480-488 (9 numbers). So, how many groups? 5 groups, but the last one has 9 numbers. So, the number of 8's in the tens place is 4 groups * 10 + 1 group * 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, no. Wait, each group contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. But in the last group, 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers (480-488). So, each group contributes 10 numbers, but the last group only has 9. So, total number of 8's in the tens place is 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, that's the same as units place. Wait, let me check: 80-89: 10 eights in tens place. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: 9 eights. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place gives 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, ..., 484. There are 48 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 groups of 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full groups of 10 and one partial group (480-488), totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4, so that would be 48 numbers. But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence? Let me check: 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so the integer part is 48, but since 484 is included, it's actually 48 + 1 = 49? No, wait, no. Because when you divide 484 by 10, you get 48.4, which means there are 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then the 49th number is 484, which is the 49th occurrence. Hmm, maybe I should think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete sets of 10 in 488, which is 48 full sets (since 488 / 10 = 48.8), so 48 times, and then the remaining 8 pages (481-488) include 484, which is another 4 in the units place. So total 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. Let me list them: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The first term is 4, the last term is 484, and the common difference is 10. So the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. The book goes up to 488, so the highest three-digit number is 488. So, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for two-digit numbers), 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, but for the tens place, we're looking at numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, for each hundred, there's a range where the tens digit is 4. Let's see:\n\n- 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers)\n- 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers)\n- 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers)\n- 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers)\n- 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, 10 numbers)\n\nSo that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This would be from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Okay.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nAgain, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8's appear every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such ranges there are.\n\n- 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers)\n- 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers)\n- 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers)\n- 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers)\n- 400-488: 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nWait, so for the hundreds digit 4, the tens digit 8 would be 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the hundreds place, we have 4 ranges with 10 numbers each (80-89, etc.), and one range with 9 numbers (480-488). So total number of 8's in the tens place is 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\n- 80-89: 10\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9\n\nTotal: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up all the occurrences of 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems off because earlier, for 4's, we had 188, and for 8's, 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90 more 4's than 8's. But let me double-check my counts.\n\nWait, for the 4's in the tens place, I had 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5*10=50, which is correct.\n\nFor the 4's in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 49, correct.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 49, correct.\n\nTens place for 8's: 49, correct.\n\nSo total 4's: 49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98\n\nSo the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I missed any 8's in the hundreds place. Since the book is only up to 488, there's no page 800-899, so no 8's in the hundreds place. So yes, 0.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. The range 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I count the tens place for 8's, I have 4 full decades (80-89, etc.) each contributing 10, and one partial decade contributing 9, so total 49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers. From 4 to 484, there are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last range being 480-488 (9 numbers), totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a number, we'll take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4, so actually, it's 48 + 1 = 49 times. Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so up to 488, the units place 4's would be 48 times. But wait, 484 is the last one, which is 48*10 + 4 = 484. So from 4 to 484, that's 48 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the units place. So 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one range, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's 5 ranges, so 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So total 4's are 187. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, but let's see. The last page is 488, so the units place 8's go up to 488. So how many? The first 8 is at 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing an 8 in the units place. So that's 48 times. But wait, 488 is 48*10 + 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. So actually, it's 49 times. Wait, but 488 is included, so from 8 to 488, that's 49 numbers. Let me check: 8, 18, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So units place 8's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. This happens in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 80-89, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. 280-289, 380-389. So that's 4 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So 4 * 10 = 40. But wait, does 380-389 go beyond 488? No, because 389 is less than 488. So that's 4 ranges, 40 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So total 8's are 89. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 89 (number of 8's) = 98. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations because 98 seems like a big difference. Let me recount the 4's and 8's again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: From 4, 14, ..., 484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. Wait, earlier I thought it was 48, but now I'm getting 49. Hmm, which is correct? Let me list them: 4,14,24,...,484. The first term is 4 (which is 4*1), the last term is 484 (which is 4*121). So the number of terms is 121. Wait, that can't be right because 484 is 484, so 484/10=48.4, so 48 full decades, but 484 is the 49th term. So yes, units place 4's are 49. Wait, earlier I thought units place 4's were 48, but now I'm getting 49. So I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that.\n\nSo units place 4's: 49.\n\nTens place 4's: From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50.\n\nHundreds place 4's: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers (as 488-400+1=89).\n\nSo total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, earlier I had 187, but now it's 188. So I must have miscalculated before.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488-8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49.\n\nTens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389. That's 4 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 4*10=40.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo total 8's: 49 + 40 +0=89.\n\nSo now, the difference is 188 (4's) - 89 (8's)=99.\n\nWait, so now I'm getting 99. But earlier I thought 187-89=98. So which is correct? Let me check again.\n\nWait, the units place for 4's: 4,14,...,484. So 484 is the 49th term because (484-4)/10 +1=48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, units place: 8,18,...,488. That's also 49 terms.\n\nSo 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units)+40 (tens)+0=89.\n\nSo difference is 188-89=99.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 187, but that was because I miscalculated the units place as 48 instead of 49. So the correct total for 4's is 188, and 8's is 89, so the difference is 99.\n\nBut wait, let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, inclusive. 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So that's correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place, 4's: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 ranges, so 50 numbers.\n\nUnits place 4's: 49.\n\nSo 49+50+89=188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits place:49.\n\nTens place:4 ranges, so 40.\n\nSo 89 total.\n\nSo the difference is 188-89=99.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 4's. Let me check: 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's 4 ranges, 4*10=40. Correct.\n\nSo the total 4's are 188, 8's are 89, so the difference is 99.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference was 98. So I must have made a mistake in the initial count of units place for 4's. I think the correct difference is 99.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 89. The difference is 99.\n\n$\\boxed{99}$"

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 484 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 4, each 10 numbers add one more. So, 484 is the 49th 4 in the units place. Wait, maybe I should think differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in the total number. So, for 488 pages, the number of groups of 10 is 48 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups). Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, the last group is 480-488, so in that group, the units digits go from 0 to 8, so 484 is included, which is the 49th occurrence. Hmm, so maybe it's 49 times? Let me check: from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is (488 // 10) + 1 if 488 mod 10 is >=4. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. Since the remainder is 8, which is greater than or equal to 4, we add 1 more. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, units place gives 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 fours in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? The first block is 40-49, which is the first 10 numbers in the tens place. Then, each subsequent hundred will have another block. Since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digits go up to 4. So, for hundreds digit 0 (which is just 1-99), the tens digit 4 occurs once (40-49). For hundreds digit 1 (100-199), the tens digit 4 occurs once (140-149). Similarly, for hundreds digit 2 (200-299), it's 240-249. For hundreds digit 3 (300-399), it's 340-349. For hundreds digit 4 (400-488), it's 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many blocks is that? From hundreds digit 0 to 4, that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50 fours. But wait, let me check the last block: 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's valid. So, 5 blocks, each with 10 fours, so 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers. From 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, the last group is 480-488, so 488 is included. So, how many 8's in the units place? It's 48 + 1 = 49. Because 488 is the 49th occurrence. Let me check: 488 // 10 = 48, and since 488 mod 10 = 8, which is >=8, so we add 1. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8's in the tens place. These occur in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. How many blocks are there? Let's see: hundreds digit 0 (80-89), 1 (180-189), 2 (280-289), 3 (380-389), and 4 (480-488). So, that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 eights, so 5 * 10 = 50 eights. Wait, but the last block is 480-488, which is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, does that affect the count? In the tens place, the tens digit is 8 for all numbers from 480 to 489, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, does that mean in the tens place, the last block contributes 9 eights instead of 10? Wait, no, because when we're counting the tens digit, it's the tens digit that's 8, regardless of the units digit. So, from 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers, so that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, etc.) each contribute 10 eights, but the last block contributes 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 * 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but earlier I thought there were 5 blocks, but the last one only contributes 9. So, total is 49. Hmm, that's different from the fours, where the hundreds digit had 89. Let me confirm: For the tens place, the number of eights is as follows: - 80-89: 10 eights - 180-189: 10 eights - 280-289: 10 eights - 380-389: 10 eights - 480-488: 9 eights (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them) So, total eights in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours: 188, total eights: 98. Difference: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for fours:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the tens place for fours. Let me check that again. For fours in the tens place, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, that's 5 blocks * 10 = 50 fours. That seems correct.\n\nFor eights in the tens place, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, but the last block (480-488) contributes 9 eights because it's only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place for fours, we have 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nSo, the total fours are indeed 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nEights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because the difference seems quite large. Let me see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor units digit:\n\n- For any digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place from 1 to N is floor(N/10) + (1 if N mod 10 >= d else 0).\n\nSo, for 4's in units place:\n\nfloor(488/10) = 48, and 488 mod 10 = 8 >=4, so 48 +1 =49.\n\nSimilarly for 8's:\n\nfloor(488/10)=48, 488 mod 10=8 >=8, so 48 +1=49.\n\nTens digit:\n\nFor tens digit d, the number is floor((N)/100)*10 + min(max(0, (N mod 100) - d*10 +1),10).\n\nWait, that might be more complicated. Alternatively, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9. So, for each hundred, the digit d appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 488 pages, how many hundreds? 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 400-488.\n\nFor fours in tens place:\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49 in 0-99, 140-149 in 100-199, etc.). There are 5 hundreds (0-4), but the fifth hundred is only up to 488. So, in the first four hundreds, each contributes 10 fours in the tens place. The fifth hundred (400-488) has 440-449 as the tens digit 4, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, total fours in tens place: 5 *10=50.\n\nSimilarly for eights in tens place:\n\nEach hundred has a block where the tens digit is 8, contributing 10 eights. For hundreds 0-3, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights. The fifth hundred (400-488) has 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds digit:\n\nFor fours, it's from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nFor eights, there are no page numbers with hundreds digit 8, since the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, that confirms the earlier counts.\n\nTherefore, the difference is indeed 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm going to check another way. Maybe I can write a small program or use a formula to calculate the number of times each digit appears. But since I'm doing this manually, I'll try to think differently.\n\nAnother approach is to consider each digit position separately and calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in each.\n\nLet's start with units place:\n\n- For 488 pages, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each cycle of 10, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is floor(488/10) =48 full cycles, and then in the partial cycle from 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so 4 appears once (at 484). So, total 48 +1=49 fours.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: floor(488/10)=48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, and in the partial cycle, 488 is included, which is an 8 in the units place. So, 48 +1=49 eights.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor the tens digit, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in each hundred. So, for each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\nNumber of hundreds: 488 pages mean 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 400-488.\n\nSo, for fours in tens place:\n\n4 full hundreds contribute 4*10=40 fours, and the fifth hundred (400-488) has 440-449, which is 10 numbers, contributing another 10 fours. So, total 40 +10=50 fours.\n\nFor eights in tens place:\n\n4 full hundreds contribute 4*10=40 eights, and the fifth hundred (400-488) has 480-488, which is 9 numbers, contributing 9 eights. So, total 40 +9=49 eights.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor hundreds digit 4, it's from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nFor hundreds digit 8, there are no numbers, since the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, total fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal eights:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 484 is the 49th occurrence because it's 484 = 48*10 + 4. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. Wait, no, actually, when I divide 484 by 10, it's 48.4, which means there are 48 full tens, so 48+1=49. Hmm, but wait, let me check: from 0 to 484, the number of multiples of 10 is 48 (since 48*10=480), but 484 is beyond that. Wait, no, in the units place, it's every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, the number of 4's in the units place is the number of times 4 appears in 1-488 in the units digit. So, how many complete decades are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48*1=48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), does 484 appear? Yes, 484 is within 481-488, so that's one more 4. So total units place 4's: 48+1=49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these decades contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such decades there are. The first is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, that's another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Now, does 440-449 go beyond 488? 449 is less than 488, so yes, that's another 10. So, how many such decades are there? From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449: that's 5 decades. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds digit. So, how many 4's in the hundreds place? 89. Wait, but let me think: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many. The last number is 488, which is 488/10=48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48*1=48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 488 is included, which is another 8 in the units place. So, total units place 8's: 48+1=49. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in decades like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check how many such decades are within 488. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-489: but 488 is the last page, so 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, in the tens place, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set has only 9 numbers. So, each of the first four decades contributes 10 8's in the tens place, and the last one contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. Therefore, hundreds place 8's: 0. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me go through the 4's again: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Yes, that seems correct. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, ..., 484.

Thus, 0 occurrences.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " But since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 484 is 48*10 + 4, so that's the 48th occurrence. Wait, actually, from 4 to 484, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that. The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. The first is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is up to 449, which is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. The last number is 488, so how many? Using the same formula: (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such ranges there are. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. Now, 480-489 would be the next, but since the book only goes up to 488, the range 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, the number of 8's is 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus the partial range 480-488. So, 4*10=40, plus 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (since 480-488 has tens digit 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, actually, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers because 480 is 4 8 0, 481 is 4 8 1, etc., up to 488, which is 4 8 8. So, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total in the tens place is 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. For the 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For the 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yes, that seems right. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and the partial range 480-488. This gives 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as there are no page numbers in the 800s.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Taking the integer part, that's 48. But wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 48*10=480, the next number is 481, which is beyond 488. Wait, no, 488 is the last page, so the number of 4's in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48. But wait, 488 is 48*10 + 8, so yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many sets of 100 there are. From 1 to 488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4 (since 400-488). So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). How many hundreds do we have? Let's see: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So that's 5 sets. Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but the tens digit 4 in 440-449 is still valid. So, for each hundred except the last one (400-488), the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times. In the last hundred (400-488), the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total for the tens place is 4 sets (1-399) each contributing 10, and the 400-488 set also contributes 10. So 5*10=50. Wait, but 400-488 is the fifth set, but does it fully include 440-449? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5*10=50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98 + 89 = 187. Wait, that can't be right because 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187? Wait, but 48 in units, 50 in tens, 89 in hundreds. Wait, 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. Hmm, but let me think again: from 1 to 488, how many 4's are there? Let me check another way. For units place: 4,14,24,...,484. That's (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. Wait, that's 49 times, not 48. So I think I made a mistake earlier. Because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but when counting inclusive, it's 49 times. Wait, let me confirm: numbers ending with 4 from 4 to 484. The first is 4, which is 4*1, and the last is 484, which is 4*121. So the count is 121 - 1 +1=121? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 4*1=4, 4*2=8, but that's not correct because 4*10=40, so the units digit cycles every 10. So the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete decades plus one if the last number is in the current decade. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then in the 49th decade, which is 480-488, the 484 is included, so that's one more. So total units place 4's: 48 +1=49. Similarly, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? It's every 100 numbers, 10 times each. So from 1-488, how many hundreds? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Then, in the last hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total tens place 4's: 4*10 +10=50. Wait, but 401-488 is the fifth hundred, but 440-449 is within that. So yes, 5 sets, each contributing 10. So 5*10=50. Now, hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89. Now, adding up: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 4's: 49+50=99 +89=188. Wait, earlier I thought 187, but now it's 188. Let me check again. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. The count is (484 -4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each hundred contributes 10, and there are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, etc.), so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So 89. So total 4's: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8,18,28,...,488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then in the 49th decade, 488 is included, so that's one more. So units place 8's: 48 +1=49. 2. **Tens place:** 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Wait, 480-488: the tens digit is 8, but only up to 488. So how many numbers? From 480-488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So in the tens place, each hundred contributes 10 numbers, except the last one, which contributes 9. So, how many hundreds? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So 5 hundreds. Each of the first four hundreds contributes 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), and the last hundred contributes 9 numbers (480-488). So total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 8's: 49+49=98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's and 8's. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check again. When counting the tens place 8's, I considered 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four sets (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last set, 480-488, has 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So 40+9=49. That seems correct. Similarly, for 4's in the tens place, I had 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50. And for 4's in the units place, 49. And hundreds place 89. So total 4's: 188. 8's: 98. So the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears in numbers 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full decades plus one more).\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each hundred contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, ..., 400-488), so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in numbers 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. The first four sets contribute 10 each, and the last set contributes 9, so 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in any page number up to 488, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 484 is the 49th occurrence because it starts counting from 0. Let me check: 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so the integer part is 48, but since 484 is included, it's actually 49. Wait, no, that's not right. Because 484 is the 49th term in the sequence 4,14,24,...,484. Wait, let me think again. The number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is given by ((last term - first term)/common difference) + 1. So here, first term is 4, last term is 484, common difference is 10. So ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 appears in the tens place for numbers from 40 to 49, 140 to 149, 240 to 249, 340 to 349, and 440 to 449. Let me count how many numbers in each of these ranges. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, each subsequent hundred has another 10 numbers. So from 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. But wait, the book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? Well, 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So there are 89 numbers where the hundreds digit is 4. So total 4's are 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers. So numbers like 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, how many terms? Using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So let's count each range: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So total 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the difference is number of 4's minus number of 8's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Taking the integer part, that's 48 numbers. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is indeed the last number with a 4 in the units place. So, 48 times the 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, 40-49 is the first set, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets. Each set has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, the last page is 488, so does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488? Yes, so all 5 sets are complete. So, 50 times the 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Since 488 is the last page, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times the 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the number of 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The last occurrence is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 times the 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets there are. From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets. Each set contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the first four sets contribute 4*10=40, and the last set contributes 9. So, total 40+9=49 times the 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Adding up the number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units: 48, tens:50, hundreds:89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. For the 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, correct. And for the tens place, 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Units place, 48 numbers. Yes, that adds up. For the 8's, units place: 49 numbers, tens place: 49 numbers, and hundreds place:0. So, 98 eights. So, 187-98=89. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** Every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets of 10 (480 numbers), plus 8 more (481-488). Thus, 48 + 1 = 49. However, since 488 is the last page, we only count up to 484, which gives 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive).\n\nTotal 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** Every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once.

Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within that. So, 48 times 4 appears in the units place. But let me check: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? It's floor(488 / 10) which is 48. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one block. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So, that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, in the last block, 440-449, does 449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50 times. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up the units, tens, and hundreds places: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187 times that the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so actually, it's 488 // 10 + 1 if 488 mod 10 is 8. Wait, 488 mod 10 is 8, so yes, it's 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor(488 / 10) is 48, but since 488 ends with 8, the count is 49. Let me check: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 80-89 is one block. From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. From 400-488: Does 480-489 exist? Yes, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8. Wait, 480-489 would be the next block, but since we only go up to 488, how many numbers are there? Let me think. The tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, in the hundreds place 4, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many blocks? 0-99: 1 block (80-89). 100-199: 1 block (180-189). 200-299: 1 block (280-289). 300-399: 1 block (380-389). 400-488: 1 block (480-488), which is 9 numbers. So, that's 5 blocks, but the last block has 9 instead of 10. So, total numbers where 8 is in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, so 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? The first occurrence is 80-89: 10 numbers. Then 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. Then 480-488: 9 numbers. So, 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 times. Now, adding up the units and tens places: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98 times that the digit 8 appears. Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake here. Because in the hundreds place, 8 doesn't appear, but in the tens place, I had 49. Let me confirm again. Units place: 49. Tens place: 49. Hundreds place: 0. So total 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the number of 4's was 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through the 4's again. Units place: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. That's 48 numbers. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 50 numbers. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct. Now for 8's: Units place: 8, 18, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. That's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, totaling 49 numbers. So, 49 + 49 = 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, that seems correct, but I feel like I might have missed something. Let me try another approach to verify. Alternatively, I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position separately, making sure I'm not double-counting or missing any numbers. For the 4's: Units place: 4,14,...,484. As before, 48 numbers. Tens place: 40-49: 10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So, 5 blocks, 50 numbers. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So, 48+50+89=187. For the 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. The last number is 488, which is the 49th term because (488 -8)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49+49=98. Therefore, the difference is 187-98=89. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** The digit '4' appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 488 count? The last page is 488, so the units digit for 488 is 8, not 4. So, 484 is the last page with a 4 in the units place. Therefore, there are 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many sets of ten there are. From 1 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100 pages. So, in each hundred, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many hundreds are there? Well, 488 is less than 500, so we have 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 480-488. Wait, actually, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449. So, let me correct that. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 449 is 449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 10 in each hundred, and there are 4 full hundreds (0-399) plus the 400-488 range, which includes another 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, let's add up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last page is 488, which ends with an 8. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so we take 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, we have 49 occurrences. Wait, let's check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place 8's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each set. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, 8's occur as follows: 10 (from 80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 49. So, tens place 8's: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 187-98=89. That seems correct. So, the answer should be 89.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).

    "text": " Taking the integer part, that's 48. Wait, but 484 is the 49th occurrence because 484 is the 49th multiple of 10 (since 4 is the first). Hmm, maybe I should calculate it as (484 - 4)/10 + 1. Let me check: (484 - 4) is 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. But wait, does 484 count? Yes, because 484 is less than or equal to 488. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me count these. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 40-49: 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149: another 10, and so on. How many such blocks are there? The last block would be 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's four blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, that's actually five blocks. Wait, no, let me think again. The first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). So that's five blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488? Yes, so that's fine. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484. As I calculated, 49 times. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each 10 numbers, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,..., up to 488. Let me see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. The count is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let me count each block. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 +10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again. For 4's: Units place: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. Total 188. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total 98. 188 -98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, when I counted the tens place for 4's, I included 440-449, which is correct because 449 is less than 488. Similarly, for 8's in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, which is correct. So, yes, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a number, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 484 is the 48th multiple of 10, so that's correct. So, there are 48 numbers where 4 is in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then, each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-499) has one such block. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last block would be 440-449, since 488 is less than 499. So, how many blocks are there? Let's see: 40-49 is one, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks in total. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 numbers where the tens digit is 4. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. How many numbers is that? Well, 488 minus 400 is 88, but since both 400 and 488 are included, we add 1: 88 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. Now, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many that is. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, 488 is included, so let me check: 488 is 48\u00d710 + 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, because starting from 8 (which is 1\u00d78), 18 is 2\u00d78, etc., up to 488, which is 49\u00d710 + 8. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think: The number of times 8 appears in the units place is equal to how many full decades are there up to 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490). But wait, 488 is within 481-490, so the units digit 8 appears in 48\u00d710 + 1 (since 488 is included). Wait, no, that's not correct. Each decade has exactly one 8 in the units place. So, from 1-488, how many decades are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 48\u00d710 is 480, so 480 is included, and 488 is beyond that. So, from 1-480, there are 48 8's in the units place. Then, from 481-488, there's another 8 at 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that seems correct. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 in the tens place appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many such blocks: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10, and 480-488: how many? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the last contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 187 and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 48 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, giving 89 numbers.\n- **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. This gives 49 numbers.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's appear here.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Taking the integer part, that's 48, but wait, since 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4, it's actually 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, let me think again. The number of times a digit appears in the units place up to N is floor(N/10). So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor(488/10) is 48. But since 488 is included, and 488's units digit is 8, not 4, so the number of 4's in the units place would be 48. Wait, no, because when N is 488, the last number with 4 in the units place is 484, which is 48*10 + 4. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 400-488. In each full hundred, the tens digit is 4 once, contributing 10 numbers each. So, 4 full hundreds would give 4*10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred, 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, 410-419, etc., but wait, 400-488 includes 400-488, so the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, 480-488. Wait, no, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, etc., but actually, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, 480-488. Wait, no, that's not correct. The tens digit is 4 in any block where the tens digit is 4. So, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, not 10. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear in 400-488? It's 9 times (480-488) plus 8 times (400-409, etc.), but wait, no. Actually, each full block of 100 has 10 numbers with tens digit 4, but in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409 (10 numbers), 410-419 (10), 420-429 (10), 430-439 (10), 440-449 (10), 450-459 (10), 460-469 (10), 470-479 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers). Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). So, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? It's 9 times in the tens place because from 400-488, the tens digit cycles 0-8, so 4 appears once in each cycle. Wait, no, the tens digit is 4 for each 10 numbers, so in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 400-409, 410-419, etc., but since 488 is less than 490, the last block is 480-488, which is only 9 numbers. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 400-409: 10 numbers, 410-419:10, ..., 470-479:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 8 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 numbers, and one block of 9. So, the tens digit 4 appears 8*10 + 9 = 89 times? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the tens digit is 4 in the numbers where the tens digit is 4, regardless of the hundreds. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. Each of these is a block where the tens digit is 4, and each such block has 10 numbers except the last one, which has 9. So, how many such blocks are there? From 400-488, the tens digit cycles 0-8, so 4 appears in the tens place 9 times: 400-409 (tens digit 0?), wait no, the tens digit is 0 in 400-409? Wait, no, 400-409 is hundreds digit 4, tens digit 0, units digits 0-9. So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is one block of 10 numbers. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think differently. The tens digit is 4 in any number where the second digit from the right is 4. So, in the range 1-488, how many numbers have 4 in the tens place? For numbers less than 100, the tens digit can be 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. For numbers 100-199, the tens digit is 4 in 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. Now, what about 480-488? The tens digit is 8, so that doesn't count. Wait, no, 480-488 has tens digit 8, so the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, the tens digit 4 appears 50 times. Wait, but earlier I thought 400-488 might have more, but no, because 440-449 is the only block in the 400s where the tens digit is 4. So, total tens digit 4's: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times. Wait, 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8, so yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many blocks? From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, total tens digit 8's: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds digit 8's: 0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 187. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. Difference: 187-98=89. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 48 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. Each block contributes 10 numbers except the last, which has 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, let me check: 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so the number of 4's in the units place is 48. Wait, but 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4, so that's correct. So, 48 times the digit 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another range, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 50 times the digit 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. The number of numbers is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. But wait, in the hundreds place, each number from 400-488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 numbers where the hundreds digit is 4. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 8, so that's correct. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count these. From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is another 10. From 200-299: 280-289 is another 10. From 300-399: 380-389 is another 10. From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place, each of the first four ranges contributes 10, and the last contributes 9. So, total for tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, 97 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Taking the integer part, that's 48. But wait, since 484 is included, I think I need to add 1. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, no, actually, when I divide 484 by 10, I get 48.4, so the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48. Because 484 is the 48th occurrence. Let me check: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the blocks are 40-49 (which is within 1-488), 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, but 450-488 is beyond that. So, that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, in the last block, 440-449, is 449 within 488? Yes, 449 is less than 488. So, 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many terms? Let's compute: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 terms. Wait, but 488 is 488, which is the 49th term because 8,18,...,488. Let me check: (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be the next block, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers. So, does that count as a full block? No, because it's only 9 numbers. So, we have 4 full blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 4 * 10 = 40. But wait, in the 480-488 block, the tens digit is 8, but only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, does that add 9 more 8's in the tens place? Wait, no, because the tens digit is 8 for all numbers from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks *10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but wait, no. Let me think again. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 5 blocks. The first four are full blocks with 10 numbers each, and the fifth is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9 = 40 +9 =49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 4 blocks, but actually, 80-89 is the first block, then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 5 blocks. So, 4 blocks with 10 numbers each and one block with 9 numbers. So, 4*10=40 and +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or more, but since the book has only 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. Wait, that can't be right because 49 +49 is 98, but let me check again. Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. So total 8's:98. Wait, but earlier when I was counting the tens place, I thought it was 49, but let me confirm. From 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, 49 in tens place. Units place:49, so total 8's:49+49=98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   - Number of terms: \\( \\frac{484}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.  \n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks.  \n   - Total: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 4 appears in 400-488.  \n   - Number of terms: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total 4's:**  \n\\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   - Number of terms: \\( \\frac{488}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.  \n   - First four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9.  \n   - Total: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 8 does not appear since page numbers go up to 488.  \n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:**  \n\\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**  \n\\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Taking the integer part, that's 48 occurrences. Wait, but 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4, so yes, 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range, so 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges there are. Starting from 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 occurrences. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so yes, 50. Wait, but 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 is another 10, 340-349 is another 10, and 440-449 is another 10, so that's 5*10=50. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can also be in the hundreds place. That would be from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? Well, from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but let me check: 400 is the first, 488 is the last. So, yes, 89 numbers. So, adding up the units, tens, and hundreds places: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187 occurrences of the digit 4. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48 occurrences. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 48 numbers: 8, 18, ..., 488. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that range. Let me count how many ranges: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480, 481, ..., 488 is 9 numbers). Wait, no: 480 is the first, 488 is the last. So, 488 - 480 +1 = 9 numbers. So, total in the tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 occurrences. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, yes, 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. So, adding up the units, tens, and hundreds places: 48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97 occurrences of the digit 8. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400 to 488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. This gives 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 48 + 49 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 484 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 0, the first 4 is at 4 (which is the 1st occurrence). So, maybe I should calculate it as (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Hmm, that seems correct. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49, which is within 1-488. The next blocks are 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Now, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many blocks are there? From 40-49, that's one block, then each subsequent hundred adds another block. So, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, all those numbers are included. So, that's correct.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let me add up all the occurrences of 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me check that addition again. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, the last occurrence is at 488. Let's calculate how many numbers that is. The formula is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Now, 480-489 would be another block, but since the book only goes up to 488, the block is 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, not 10, because 488 is the last page. So, let's see how many complete blocks there are. The first block is 80-89 (10 numbers), then 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 complete blocks of 10 and one partial block of 9. So, total numbers where 8 is in the tens place: 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, correct.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the occurrences of 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me verify the tens place again. When I considered the tens place, I included 480-488 as a partial block. So, 480 is included, right? So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's correct, 9 numbers. So, 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, totaling 49. So, 49 is correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, total 8's:98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract 98 from 188.\n\n188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check that subtraction again. 188 minus 98: 188 - 90 = 98, then subtract 8 more: 90. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. Let me double-check that. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. So, 488 - 400 +1 = 89. That's correct. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other 4's. For example, in the units place, I had 49, which includes 4,14,...,484. That's correct because 484 is the last number with 4 in the units place before 488. So, 49 is correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, 5 blocks: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, 50 is correct.\n\nSo, 49 +50 +89=188.\n\nFor the 8's, units place: 49, tens place:49, so 98 total.\n\nSo, 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in the tens place for 8's? Because when I have 480-488, that's 9 numbers, right? So, 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, which is 49. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to count the number of times a digit appears in a certain place is to use the formula where you calculate how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nLet me try that method to cross-verify.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N is floor((N + 1)/10) if d is less than the units digit of N. If d is equal to the units digit, then it's floor(N/10) +1.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to use a more systematic approach.\n\nAlternatively, for the units digit, the number of 4's is the number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488.\n\nSo, for each 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, total number of 4's in units place is floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 is included, and 488 mod 10 is 8, which is greater than 4, so we add 1, making it 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, the number of times 4 appears is calculated by looking at how many full groups of 100 there are, and in each group, the tens digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 488, there are 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 400-409, 410-419, etc., but wait, actually, in 400-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place from 400-488? It's 10 times: 400-409, 410-419, etc., but wait, 488 is the end, so the last block is 480-489, but since we stop at 488, the tens digit 8 only goes up to 488. Wait, no, actually, the tens digit is determined by the second digit. So, in 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 400-409, 410-419, ..., 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks (since 400-449 is 50 numbers, but wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so the tens digit 4 appears in 400-409 (10), 410-419 (10), 420-429 (10), 430-439 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 50 times. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the hundreds place, as we've already calculated, 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: same method, floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is equal to 8, so we add 1, making it 49.\n\nTens place: Let's see, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place up to 488.\n\nEach hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, 4 full blocks (each contributing 10) and one partial block (480-488, which is 9 numbers). So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: As before, 0 times.\n\nSo, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way to calculate this, perhaps using digit positions and the number of times each digit appears.\n\nAnother approach is to consider each digit position separately and calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nFor a 3-digit number, each digit can be considered separately.\n\nLet me consider the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - For 4: The number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete decades plus 1 if the last number is \u22654. Since 488 is the last page, the units digit goes up to 8, which is greater than 4, so we add 1.\n   - So, number of 4's in units place = floor(488/10) +1 =48 +1=49.\n   - Similarly, for 8: floor(488/10)=48, and since the units digit is 8, which is equal to 8, we add 1. So, 48 +1=49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - For 4: The number of times 4 appears in the tens place is calculated by considering how many times 40-49, 140-149, etc., occur up to 488.\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. There are 4 full hundreds (0-399), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40.\n   - Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit cycles from 0-8. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 400-409, 410-419, ..., 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, but wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers. The tens digit 4 appears in 400-409 (10), 410-419 (10), 420-429 (10), 430-439 (10), 440-449 (10). So, that's 5*10=50.\n   - Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so the tens digit 4 appears 5 times in the tens place, each time for 10 numbers, so 50 times.\n   - So, total 4's in tens place:40+50=90? Wait, that can't be right because earlier I calculated 50. Wait, no, wait, I think I'm confusing something. Let me correct this.\n   - Actually, the correct way is to calculate the number of times 4 appears in the tens place as follows:\n     - For each hundred block, the tens digit cycles 0-9, so each digit appears 10 times in the tens place per hundred.\n     - So, for 0-399, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times for the digit 4 in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n     - Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit can be 0-8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It appears once every 100 numbers, but in this case, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, ..., 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, meaning that 4 appears in the tens place in 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, totaling 50. So, the total 4's in the tens place is 40 (from 0-399) +50 (from 400-488)=90. Wait, but earlier I had only 50. That's conflicting.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm making a mistake here. Let me clarify.\n\nWhen I consider the tens place, for the entire range 1-488, the number of times 4 appears in the tens place is:\n\n- For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9, so in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, from 1-99: 10 times, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, and 400-488: how many times?\n\nIn 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, totaling 50. But wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so the tens digit 4 appears 5 times in the tens place, each time for 10 numbers, so 50 times.\n\nWait, but that would mean from 400-488, 50 times, and from 0-399, 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40. So, total 4's in tens place would be 40+50=90. But earlier, I thought it was 50. That can't be, because in the initial calculation, I had 5 blocks of 10, which would be 50, but that was only for the 400-488 range. So, actually, the correct total is 90.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier count where I thought it was 50. I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me go back. Initially, I thought that in the tens place, the 4 appears in 5 blocks: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times. But according to this new method, it's 90. That can't be right because 488 is less than 500, so the 4's in the tens place should be 90? That seems high.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm confusing the hundreds place. Let me clarify:\n\nWait, the tens digit is the second digit from the right. So, for numbers 1-99, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, and then 1-9 for 10-99.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to calculate the number of times a digit d appears in the tens place up to N as:\n\nLet me use the formula for digit counting.\n\nThe formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the tens place up to N is:\n\nLet N be represented as ABC (a 3-digit number), but if N is less than 100, we can pad it with leading zeros.\n\nThe formula is:\n\ncount = (A * 10) + if B > d then 10 else if B == d then (C + 1) else 0\n\nWait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me think differently.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the tens place up to N can be calculated by:\n\n- For each complete hundred, the digit d appears 10 times in the tens place.\n- Then, for the partial hundred, if the tens digit is greater than d, add 10; if equal, add (units digit +1); else, add 0.\n\nSo, for N=488, which is 4 8 8.\n\nTo calculate the number of times 4 appears in the tens place:\n\n- Complete hundreds: 4 (from 0-399). Each contributes 10 times, so 4*10=40.\n- Partial hundred: 400-488. The tens digit is 8. Since 8 >4, we add 10 times. So, total 40+10=50.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, total 4's in tens place:50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place:\n\n- Complete hundreds:4, each contributes 10 times, so 4*10=40.\n- Partial hundred:400-488. The tens digit is 8, which is equal to 8, so we add (units digit +1)=8+1=9.\n- So, total 8's in tens place:40+9=49.\n\nWait, that matches my earlier count.\n\nSo, for 4's in tens place:50.\n\nEarlier, I thought it was 90, but that was a mistake. The correct count is 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in hundreds place:\n\n- The hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:98.\n\nSo, difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier when I tried using the formula, I got 50 for 4's in the tens place, which aligns with the correct count. So, the initial calculation was correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in every 10th number (4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block contributes 10 numbers. There are 5 such blocks (including 440-449), totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   \n   Total '4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears in every 10th number (8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block contributes 10 numbers.

    "text": " Taking the integer part, that's 48, but wait, 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4, so actually, it's 48 times. Wait, let me check that again. The number of terms in an arithmetic sequence can be calculated as ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 numbers where 4 is in the units place. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 484 is the last one. Let me confirm: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The number of terms is indeed (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 would be beyond 488, right? Wait, no, 440-449 is within 488, but 450-459 is also within, but 440-449 is okay. Let me count how many full decades there are. Each full set of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-400, how many full hundreds are there? 400 is the 4th hundred, so 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each of these has 10 numbers with tens digit 4. So that's 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit can be 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total in tens place would be 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. Let's calculate how many terms there are. Using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be another set, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of this. So, each full hundred (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-400, that's 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. There are 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n   - Total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. There are 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Taking the integer part, that's 48. But wait, 484 is actually the 48th occurrence because 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so that would mean 48 full groups of 10, each contributing a 4 in the units place. But wait, 484 is the 48th group, so that's correct. So, 48 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 488 is beyond that, so that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. Now, 440-449: 440 is less than 488, so that's another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, I should check if 440-449 is fully included. Since 449 is less than 488, yes, it's included. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, but the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Wait, but 400 is the first number, so 488-400=88, but since we include both endpoints, it's 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488, which is 488/10=48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing an 8. So, 48 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let me count how many ranges: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: since 488 is the last page, so that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. So, the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 numbers, so that's 4*10=40. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, 97 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units place: 484 is the last number with 4 in units place. 484/10=48.4, so 48 numbers. That seems right. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 ranges, 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 48+50+89=187. Correct. For 8's: units place: 488/10=48.8, so 48 numbers. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, 48+49=97. Correct. So, 187-97=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** Every 10 numbers, '4' appears once in the units place.

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 484 is 48*10 + 4, so that's the 49th occurrence? Wait, no, because starting from 0, 484 would be the 49th term. Hmm, maybe I should think of it differently. The number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the units place 4's go up to 484, which is the 49th 4 in the units place because 4,14,24,...,484. Wait, 484 is 48*10 +4, so that's 49 numbers? Hmm, maybe I'm confusing myself. Let me think again. The number of times a digit appears in the units place is equal to the floor division of the total number by 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the floor is 48. So, 48 times 4 appears in the units place. But wait, when you reach 488, the last number with a units digit of 4 is 484, which is indeed the 49th occurrence because 4 is the first, then every 10 after that. So, 488/10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 484 is less than 488, it's included, so maybe it's 49? Wait, no, because 488 is the total number of pages, but the units digit cycles every 10. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does the units digit cycle through 0-9? It's 48 full cycles (1-480) and then 8 more numbers (481-488). In each full cycle, the units digit 4 appears once. So, 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 doesn't appear. So, total units place 4's: 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. But wait, up to 488, so the last range would be 440-449, since 450-488 is beyond that. Let me see: The tens digit is 4 in the following decades: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these contributes 10 numbers, so 5 decades, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the 440-449 range is fully included because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 5 decades, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times. Wait, but let me check: 40-49: 10 numbers, tens digit 4. 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So, 5*10=50. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times. So, total 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98+89=187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, we'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's the same as the number of times 8 is the units digit, which is floor(488/10)=48.8, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, which ends with 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, let's check: 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The formula is (last - first)/step +1. So, (488-8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. So, units place 8's:49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the following decades: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count each: - 80-89: 10 numbers, tens digit 8. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last, so 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers). So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, hundreds place 8's:0. Therefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 187-98=89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=187. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. Difference=187-98=89. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me verify the units place for 4's again. From 1-488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is 48*10 +4=484. So, that's 48 times, right? Because 4,14,24,...,484. So, 48 numbers. So, units place 4's=48. Then, tens place 4's: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Hundreds place 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 48+50+89=187. For 8's: units place, 8,18,...,488. How many terms? The last term is 488, which is 8 + (n-1)*10=488. So, (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place 8's=49. Tens place 8's: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four decades has 10 numbers, and the last one has 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. Hundreds place 8's=0. So, total 8's=49+49=98. Therefore, 187-98=89. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers is 187, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

So, that's 48 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for every block of 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 440-449. Let's see: From 1-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. From 200-299: 240-249 is another 10.

Wait, but wait, the hundreds digit is only 4 for 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last occurrence in the units place is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so integer part is 48, but wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 times? Wait, let me check. From 1-10: 8 is once. 11-20: 18, once. So, each block of 10 has one 8 in the units place. So, for 488, how many blocks of 10 are there? 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, and then the last block from 480-488 has one more 8 at 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 +1 = 49 times. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 488 is the 9th number, so yes, one more 8. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. So, how many blocks? From 1-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189 is another 10. 200-299: 280-289 is another 10. 300-399: 380-389 is another 10. 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 is the end). So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the last contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9 = 40 +9=49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, number of 4's is 187, number of 8's is 98. So, 187 -98= 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, ..., 484 \u2192 48 times.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 4 blocks \u00d710 +9 =49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 times.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 +49 +0 =98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " But since we can't have a fraction of a number, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. So, there are 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, but let me check that. If I do 484 divided by 10, it's 48.4, which means 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll check each place: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, similar to 4's in the units place, let's find how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is at 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 48 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence? Wait, let's check. The first 8 is at 8, which is 8/10 = 0.8, so the first group is 1-10, which includes 8. Then 11-20 includes 18, and so on. So, the number of 8's in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48. But wait, 488 is 48\u00d710 + 8, so that would be the 49th occurrence. Wait, maybe I should calculate it as (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me confirm: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), not 10. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only from 480 to 489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 480 +1 = 9 numbers. So, for the 400-488 range, it's 9 numbers. So, the total for the tens place: 4 ranges with 10 numbers each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one range with 9 numbers (480-488). So, that's 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place, but wait, our book only goes up to 488. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: Units place: 48, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place:89. Total 4's: 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: Units place:49, Tens place:49, Hundreds place:0. Total 8's:49+49=98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 48 such numbers (484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4 \u2192 48 full groups).\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '4' appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit '4' appears in numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - **Total '4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '8' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '8' appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each range contributes 10 numbers, except the last range (480-488), which contributes 9 numbers. This gives 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) with 10 each and one range with 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers with '8' in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's - Number of '8's = 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe digit '4' is printed 89 more times than the digit '8'.  \n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, let me check: 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so that means there are 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4, so that's correct. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges. Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400. Pages 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last page is 488, which is 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 488 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 8, so that's correct. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 is beyond 488, so that range only goes up to 488. Let me check: From 0-99: 80-89 is one range, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480 is included, and 488 is the last. So, let me count how many ranges: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 full ranges (each 10) and one partial range with 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 +9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 +49 = 97. So, 97 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (fours) - 97 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units place: 48, tens:50, hundreds:89. 48+50=98, +89=187. For 8's: units:48, tens:49, hundreds:0. 48+49=97. 187-97=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 400-488, the tens place is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's correct. And the other ranges (80-89, 180-189, etc.) are each 10 numbers, so 4 of them, 4*10=40, plus 9, total 49. So, yes, 49 in the tens place. So, 48+49=97. 4's:187, 8's:97. Difference:90. So, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   Every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place.  \n   - Total units place 4's: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, taking the integer part).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   - Number of such ranges: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).  \n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, so total tens place 4's: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488.  \n   - Total hundreds place 4's: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   Every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place.  \n   - Total units place 8's: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, taking the integer part).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   - Full ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 (4 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers).  \n   - Partial range: 480-488 (9 numbers).  \n   - Total tens place 8's: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   There are no page numbers between 800-899, so no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **97**.\n\n**Difference between the number of 4's and 8's:**  \n187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.  \n\\boxed{90}"

Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so we take 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th occurrence. Let me check: 8, 18, 28,..., 488. The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, contributing 4\u00d710=40. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, 9 numbers. So total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place starting from 800, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the hundreds place with 8.

    "text": " Taking the integer part, that's 48 times. But wait, 484 is 48*10 + 4, so that's correct. So, 48 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for numbers from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers. Let's see how many complete ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. From 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50. But wait, the last range is 440-449, which is within 488, so it's valid. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. Since 488 is the last page, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me check the last occurrence. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the last number is 488. The number of 8's in the units place is 48. Wait, but 488 is included, so that's correct: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total in tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9, which is 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding them up: 48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 97 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: Units: 48, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That's correct. For 8's: Units:48, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. 48+49=97. 187-97=90. Hmm, but let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for 8's. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That's correct. Similarly, for 4's in the tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. And hundreds place for 4's is 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 187 4's and 97 8's. The difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 48 such numbers.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n**Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 48 such numbers.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.\n**Total 8's:** 48 + 49 + 0 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Taking the integer part, that's 48 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 48 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds digit. So, that's 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me check: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 times 4 appears in the page numbers. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers. For example, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48 numbers. But wait, 488 is included, so let's check: 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, 48 numbers where 8 is in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is the last range. Let's see: From 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 how many numbers? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, for 8 in the tens place, we have 4 full ranges (each 10 numbers) and one partial range with 9 numbers. So, total for tens place: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 800 to 899. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. Therefore, the hundreds place for 8 doesn't contribute anything. So, total 8's in hundreds place: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, 97 times 8 appears in the page numbers. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Total: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\) times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges.  \n   - Total: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\) times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 4 appears in 400-488.  \n   - Total numbers: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\) times.\n\n**Total 4's:**  \n\\( 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 \\) times.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Total: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\) times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   - The last range (480-488) contributes 9 numbers.  \n   - Total: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\) times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - No page numbers in the 800s, so 0 times.\n\n**Total 8's:**  \n\\( 48 + 49 + 0 = 97 \\) times.\n\n**Difference:**  \n\\( 187 - 97 = 90 \\).\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " But since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so that's 48 full tens. So, that gives 48 4's in the units place. Wait, but let me check: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Oh, I think I made a mistake here. The correct way is to calculate (last - first)/step + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 480/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. Hmm, but wait, does 488 count? No, because 488 is beyond 484, but we're only considering up to 488, so 484 is the last one. So, 49 4's in units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one block, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another block, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Now, how many blocks are there? Let's see: 40-49 (1 block), then 140-149 (2), 240-249 (3), 340-349 (4), and 440-449 (5). So, 5 blocks in total. Each block gives 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 4's. Wait, but wait: 440-449 is up to 449, but our book goes up to 488. So, 440-449 is entirely within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. So, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 480/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is the last block. Let's count the blocks: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last). So, how many 8's in the tens place? Each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 8's. The last block, 480-488, contributes 9 8's because 488 is the last page. So, 4 blocks * 10 = 40, plus 9, total 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 4's.\n   - Total blocks: 5.\n   - Total: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Numbers: 400-488.\n   - Total: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four blocks contribute 10 each; the last contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Taking the integer part, that's 48 occurrences. Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so the number of 4's in the units place is 48. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set would be 440-449. Let me calculate how many such sets there are. From 0 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, for each hundred, there's a block where the tens digit is 4. Let's see: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So that's 5 * 10 = 50 occurrences. Wait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10 numbers, then 140-149 is another 10, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So 5 * 10 = 50. So 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. So total number of 4's is units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 48, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. Adding them up: 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me think again. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So yes, that's correct. So total 4's: 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last number is 488, so how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences? Wait, let me think. The first occurrence is at 8, then 18, ..., 488. So how many terms? The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8. So let's see how many sets. From 0 to 488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four sets is 10 numbers, and the last set is 9 numbers (480-488). So total in tens place: 4 sets * 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. Wait, no, let me correct that. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 4*10 + 9 = 49. So 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So 0 occurrences. So total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. Wait, that's 89 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big difference. Let me go through the 4's again. Units place: 48, tens:50, hundreds:89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So 187-98=89. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me make sure I didn't overcount in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. And in the tens place, 50, which is 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 numbers. So 5*10=50. Units place: 48, which is 484/10=48.4, so 48 full sets. So that's correct. For 8's, units place: 49, which is correct because 488 is included. Tens place: 49, which is correct because 480-488 is 9 numbers, plus the four full sets. So 4*10 +9=49. So yes, 98 8's. So the difference is 187-98=89. So the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\lfloor \\frac{484}{10} \\rfloor = 48 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such sets.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total number of 4's:** \\( 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four sets contributes 10 numbers, and the last set contributes 9.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**\n\\( 187 - 98 = 89 \\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Taking the integer part, that's 48 times. Wait, but 484 is the 49th occurrence because 4 is the first. Let me check: 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so the number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1? No, wait, no. Because 484 is the 49th term in the sequence 4,14,24,...,484. Let me think again. The formula for the number of terms is ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? Let's see. The first range is 40-49, which is in the 40's. Then, 140-149, which is in the 140's. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. Let me count how many ranges there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then, each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, etc.) has a 40-49 range. So, how many hundreds are there? The book goes up to 488, so the hundreds are 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, that's four hundreds. Each hundred has a 40-49 range, except maybe the last one, 400-488. Wait, 400-488 includes 400-449 and 450-488. So, 400-449 is a full 100, so the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-449, which is 50 numbers (from 400 to 499, but since we're only going up to 488, wait no, 400-449 is 50 numbers, right? Because 449 is 400 + 49, so 50 numbers. So, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, except the last hundred, which actually has 50 numbers where the tens digit is 4? Wait, no. Wait, when considering the tens place, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, for each complete hundred, that's 10 numbers. Now, how many complete hundreds do we have? From 1-99 is not a complete hundred, but 100-199 is, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, 400-488 is not a complete hundred because 488 is less than 499. So, how many times does the tens digit 4 occur? Let's break it down:\n\n- 1-99: The tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49, which is 10 numbers.\n- 100-199: 140-149, another 10 numbers.\n- 200-299: 240-249, another 10.\n- 300-399: 340-349, another 10.\n- 400-488: Here, the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-449, but since the book ends at 488, 440-449 is within that. Wait, 400-449 is 50 numbers, but the tens digit is 4 only in 400-409? No, wait, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, 410-419, etc. Wait, no. Wait, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, 410-419, ..., 440-449. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the tens digit is the second digit from the right. So, 400-409: tens digit is 0, 410-419: tens digit is 1, ..., 440-449: tens digit is 4. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, whether complete or not, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times. So, how many hundreds? Let's see:\n\n- 1-99: 10 times (40-49)\n- 100-199: 10\n- 200-299: 10\n- 300-399: 10\n- 400-488: 10 (440-449)\n\nSo, that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 400-488 includes 400-488, so 440-449 is within that. So, yes, 10 numbers where tens digit is 4.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 1-99 has 10, then 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488, each contributing 10, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but 1-99 is actually not a full hundred, but it still contributes 10. So, total tens place 4's: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. That happens in the page numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, each of these numbers has 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since our book ends at 488, it's from 400 to 488, which is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times the hundreds digit is 4.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds:\n\n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, units place: 49.\n\nTens place: 50.\n\nHundreds place: 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nHmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, similar to 4's, the first occurrence is 8, then 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, 488 is included. So, how many 8's in the units place?\n\nUsing the same method as before: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 can appear in the tens place. So, ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n\nWait, let's count each:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers.\n- 180-189: 10.\n- 280-289: 10.\n- 380-389: 10.\n- 480-488: Here, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\n- 80-89: 10\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9\n\nTotal: 10\u00d74 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, 49 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can't be 8. The hundreds digits go up to 4 (in 400-488). So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds:\n\n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. For 480-488, the tens digit is 8, right? Because 480 is 4 8 0, so tens digit is 8. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 40 from the other ranges plus 9, totaling 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For example, in the units place, 488 is included, so 488 is counted in the units place as an 8. Similarly, in the tens place, 480-488 are counted.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nNow, total 4's: 188.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the tens place for 4's. Earlier, I thought there are 50 occurrences, but let me recount. The tens digit is 4 in:\n\n- 40-49: 10\n- 140-149: 10\n- 240-249: 10\n- 340-349: 10\n- 440-449: 10\n\nWait, that's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. So, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, we have:\n\n- 80-89:10\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nTotaling 49.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly for 4's? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nAnd for 8's, since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nSo, yes, 89 + 50 + 49 = 188 for 4's, and 49 + 49 = 98 for 8's.\n\nSo, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a large number. Let me try a different approach to verify.\n\nAlternative approach: For each digit position, count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFor 4's: floor(488/10) = 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488/10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, and then in the 49th group (480-488), how many 4's? Only 484, which is one more. So, total 48 +1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's: floor(488/10) = 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and in the 49th group, 488 is included, so that's another 8. So, 48 +1 = 49.\n\nSo, units place: 4's=49, 8's=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4's: Each hundred has a 40-49 range, contributing 10 numbers. How many hundreds? From 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, 5 hundreds. Each contributes 10, so 5\u00d710=50.\n\nBut wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 only from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, right? Because 400-439 would have tens digits 0-3, 440-449: 4, 450-488: 5-8. So, yes, 10 numbers in 400-488 where tens digit is 4.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place: Each hundred has an 80-89 range, contributing 10 numbers. How many hundreds? 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, 5 hundreds. Each contributes 10, so 5\u00d710=50. But wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, total 8's in tens place: 4\u00d710 +9=49.\n\nSo, 4's in tens place:50, 8's:49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor 4's: 400-488: 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in hundreds place.\n\nFor 8's: No page numbers have 8 in hundreds place, since the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, 4's:89, 8's:0.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but another way to check: Let's consider that in each digit position, the number of times a digit appears can be calculated using the formula.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in units place up to n is:\n\ncount = n // 10 * 1 + min(n % 10, d) if d !=0 else 0.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. The standard formula is:\n\nFor a given digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place from 1 to n is:\n\nfull_cycles = n // 10\n\ncount = full_cycles\n\nif d !=0:\n    count +=1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0\n\nWait, no, actually, it's:\n\ncount = full_cycles\n\nif d <= (n % 10):\n    count +=1\n\nBut for d=0, it's different because 0 doesn't appear in the units place for numbers >=1.\n\nWait, let me think. For units digit d (d\u22600), the number of times it appears up to n is:\n\nnumber of full cycles of 10: n // 10\n\nplus 1 if the remainder (n % 10) >= d.\n\nSo, for 4's in units place up to 488:\n\nfull_cycles = 488 //10 =48\n\nremainder=488%10=8\n\nsince 8 >=4, add 1.\n\nSo, total 4's in units place:48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nfull_cycles=48\n\nremainder=8 >=8, so add 1.\n\nTotal 8's in units place:48+1=49.\n\nFor tens place:\n\nThe formula is a bit more complex. For tens digit d, the count is:\n\nhigher = n // 100\n\ncurrent = (n //10) %10\n\nlower = n %10\n\nif d < current:\n    count = (higher +1) *10\nelif d == current:\n    count = higher *10 + lower +1\nelse:\n    count = higher *10\n\nBut I might be mixing up the formula. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, for the tens digit, each digit from 0-9 appears equally in each block of 100 numbers. So, in each 100 numbers, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, for 4's in tens place:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds in 488: 4 (since 488//100=4). Each contributes 10, so 4\u00d710=40.\n\nBut wait, 400-488 is the fifth hundred, but it's not complete. So, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 4's in tens place:4\u00d710 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds:4, each contributing 10, so 4\u00d710=40.\n\nIn the incomplete hundred (400-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total 8's in tens place:40+9=49.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\nOnly numbers from 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 488-400 +1=89 numbers.\n\nSo, 89 4's in hundreds place.\n\n8's in hundreds place:0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 484 is the 49th occurrence because it starts counting from 0. Wait, maybe I should think differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place up to N can be calculated by (N // 10) + 1 if the digit is less than the current digit in the tens place, but I'm getting confused. Maybe a better approach is to calculate how many times 4 appears in each position separately. Let me try again. For the units place: Every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last number, which is 488. So, the units digit in 488 is 8, not 4, so the last complete group is 480, which is 48*10. So, 48 times. But wait, starting from 1, the first 4 is at 4, which is the 4th number. So, from 1 to 488, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last number, so 488//10 is 48, which gives 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This occurs in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges there are. The first range is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many such ranges are there? From 0 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, how many hundreds are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds, but we need to check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, the number of ranges where the tens digit is 4 is 5: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is the fifth range, and 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This occurs from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, every 10 numbers, the units digit is 8. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is the last number, which is 488, so the units digit is 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, because 488 is included. So, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is 48 (from 8, 18, ..., 478) plus 1 more for 488, making it 49. Wait, let me think. The first occurrence is 8, which is 8. The next is 18, 28, ..., 478, which is 478 = 47*10 + 8. Then, 488 is 48*10 + 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many ranges there are. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, total ranges: 4 full ranges (each 10 numbers) and one partial range with 9 numbers. So, total occurrences in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. This would occur from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: Units: 48, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. Total 187. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total 98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the number of 4's in the tens place. Let's see: The tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so 5 ranges \u00d710=50. That seems correct. For 8's in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 ranges, but the last one is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, 4 ranges \u00d710=40, plus 9=49. That seems correct. Units place for 8: 48 full groups (each 10 numbers) gives 48, plus 488 which is another 8, so 49. So, that's correct. So, 187-98=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 48 times (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 times (e.g., 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 49 times (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 times.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, let me check: from 4 to 484, how many steps of 10 are there? It's actually (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 instances where 4 appears in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does 484 exist? Yes, because 484 is less than 488. So, 49 is correct. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449: does 449 exist? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's five ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is okay. So, 50 instances in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400. Pages 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 numbers where the hundreds digit is 4. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, let me add that again: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last page is 488, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but including 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 instances. Wait, let me check: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see, does 480-489 exist? Yes, up to 488. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, total in tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no hundreds digits of 8 in the page numbers. Therefore, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds =49+49+0=98. Wait, 49+49 is 98. So, 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 =90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers.

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, let me check that. 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so that means there are 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But 484 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 4, each 10 pages add another 4. Wait, maybe I should think of it as (488 / 10) which is 48.8, and taking the integer part, which is 48. So, there are 48 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Let's count them: - 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 4's in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, and the book goes up to 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400 to 488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, 400 is the first, so 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, looking at units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last page is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, 488 is included, so 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488. So, 488 is the 49th 8 in the units place. Wait, let me check: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so the number of 8's in the units place is 49, because 488 is included. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place, such as 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers with an 8 in the tens place. Let's count them: - 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n\nWait, does 480-489 have 8's in the tens place? Yes, but 480-489 would be from 480 to 489, but our book only goes up to 488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, that's an extra set but only 9 numbers. So, let's see: 80-89: 10\n180-189: 10\n280-289: 10\n380-389: 10\n480-488: 9\n\nSo, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers.

    "text": " But since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. So, there are 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, but let me check: 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so the number of 4's in the units place is 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449: the last page is 488, so 440-449 is within 488, right? So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So 5 * 10 = 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. But wait, I should check if 440-449 is entirely within the page numbers. Since the book goes up to 488, yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for page numbers from 400 to 488. Let's see: from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's printed are 187. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the number of 8's in the units place is 48. Because 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, 48 occurrences. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-489 would be the next, but since the book only goes up to 488, we have to check if 480-488 is included. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (480,481,...,488). Wait, but in the tens place, the digit is 8 for all these numbers because 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but we're stopping at 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, we have 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Plus the partial range 480-488, which contributes 9 numbers. So, total in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers. So, total 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 for page numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, there are 0 occurrences of 8 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, total 8's printed are 97. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.
