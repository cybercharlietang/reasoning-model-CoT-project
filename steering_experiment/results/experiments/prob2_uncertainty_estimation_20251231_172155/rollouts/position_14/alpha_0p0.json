    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence because starting from 4 as the first, each subsequent 10 numbers adds another. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can also appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's one set. Then 140-149: another. 240-249: another. 340-349: another. 440-449: another. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, right? So yes, 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's actually 49 numbers because from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, the count is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be another set, but since the book only goes up to 488, that's only 480-488. So, how many sets do we have? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. And 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but wait: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So total is 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place: 0. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For the 4's: units place: 48, tens: 50, hundreds:89. Total 187. For the 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, but let me check again, maybe I made a mistake in counting the 4's in the tens place. Wait, when counting the tens place for 4's, I considered 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50. That seems correct. And the hundreds place: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times. So, 48 +50 +89=187. For the 8's: units place: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. Let me calculate it as (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units:49. Tens place: as above, 49. So, total 98. So, the difference is 187-98=89. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one block, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is another 10, but wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 48th occurrence because 488 is 48*10 + 8. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block is 10 numbers. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 80-89 is one block, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. Now, from 400-488: The next block would be 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, we have 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, instead of a full block of 10, we have 9. So, the tens place has 4 full blocks (each 10) and one partial block of 9. So, 4 * 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because from 0-399, we have 4 blocks of 10, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then from 400-488, the tens digit 8 would occur in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, 97 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit '4' and '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting the digit '4':**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 48 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total '4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit '8':**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 48 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 4 full blocks \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrence.\n- **Total '8's:** 48 + 49 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one block, so 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another block, another 10 numbers. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks (10-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). But wait, the last block is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 times. Wait, but let me check: from 40-49: 10 numbers. 140-149: another 10. 240-249: 10. 340-349: 10. 440-449: 10. That's 5 blocks, so 5*10=50. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the number of 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The last one is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that would be 49 times. Wait, because from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, how many terms? Let's see: The first term is 8 (which is 8*1), and the last term is 488 (which is 8*61). Wait, 8*61 is 488, right? Because 8*60=480, plus 8 is 488. So, the number of terms is 61. Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + 10(n-1) = 488. So, 10(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 times in the units place. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 1-99: 80-89 is one block, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, 10. From 300-399: 380-389, 10. From 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 +1 = 9 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers instead of 10. So, total blocks: 4 full blocks (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each contributing 10 numbers, and one partial block contributing 9 numbers. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. For the 4's: units place: 48, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 187. For the 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 98. Difference:187-98=89. Hmm, that seems right. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).

The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 4's in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers).

How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-488. Each block contributes 10 8's in the tens place. How many such blocks? From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers because 488 is the last, so 480-488 is 9 numbers). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the hundreds place, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks (0-399) contribute 4*10=40 8's in the tens place. The last block (400-488) contributes 9 8's. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book has only 488 pages, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " But since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence. Let me check: from 4 to 484, that's every 10 pages. So, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, but since we're only counting complete tens, it's 48 times. But wait, when I think about it, starting from 4, every 10 pages adds another 4 in the units place. So, for 488 pages, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's the number of times 4 appears in 1 to 488 in the units digit. So, the number of 4's in units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) in 488. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, in the 480-488 range, the units digit 4 appears once (at 484).

Then each hundred has another set: 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 sets in total. Each set contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is fully within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 sets, each with 10 4's in the tens place, so 50 4's. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can also be 4. The numbers from 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. So, total 4's in hundreds place: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is at 488. How many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so let's check: the number of 8's in the units place is equal to the number of times 8 appears in the units digit from 1 to 488. That's every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8 is the first occurrence at 8, then 18, 28,...,488. Let me count: from 8 to 488, how many numbers? The formula is floor((488 - 8)/10) + 1. So, (488 - 8) = 480, 480 / 10 = 48, so 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times. Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Let me think again. When you have numbers from 1 to N, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place is floor(N/10) if d \u2260 0, but if N ends with d, then it's floor(N/10) + 1. Wait, no, more accurately, it's floor((N - d)/10) + 1 if d \u2264 N. So, for d=8, N=488. So, floor((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = floor(480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times. So, units place: 49 8's. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 can appear in the tens place. The ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. So, how many such ranges are there? Let's see: 80-89: that's 10 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10, and 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, total 8's in the tens place: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and 1 range of 9 (480-488). So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 480-488 is within 488. Yes, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, total 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but since the book only has 488 pages, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that can't be right because when I counted 4's, I got 187, and 8's as 98, so the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89. But wait, let me double-check my counting because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me recount the 8's in the tens place. The ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 5 ranges. Each of the first four ranges contributes 10 8's in the tens place, and the last one contributes 9. So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. So, that's correct. So, 49 in the tens place.\n\nIn the units place, I had 49 8's. So, total 98 8's. Wait, but earlier I thought 8's in units place were 49, and in tens place 49, so total 98. But when I count 4's, I got 187. So, the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89. But I have a feeling that might not be correct because I think I might have overcounted the 4's in the hundreds place. Let me check that again.\n\nFor the 4's in the hundreds place, the numbers are from 400 to 488. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the 8's in the units place. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, the numbers are 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488. So, 8 + 10(n-1) \u2264 488 \u2192 10(n-1) \u2264 480 \u2192 n-1 \u2264 48 \u2192 n \u2264 49. So, 49 terms, so 49 8's in the units place. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, I had 49 8's, so total 98 8's. So, 4's are 187, 8's are 98, so 187 - 98 = 89. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because I remember sometimes when counting digits, especially in the hundreds place, you have to be careful. Let me try a different approach to confirm.\n\nAlternative approach: For each digit position, count the number of 4's and 8's separately.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\n- For 4's in units place: As before, 48 full decades (1-480), each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in 481-488, the units digit 4 appears at 484, so that's one more. So, total 49. Wait, wait, earlier I thought it was 48, but now I'm getting 49. Hmm, which is correct?\n\nWait, let's use the formula: number of times digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is floor(N/10) if d \u2260 0, but if N ends with d, then it's floor(N/10) + 1.\n\nWait, no, more accurately, it's floor((N - d)/10) + 1 if d \u2264 N.\n\nSo, for d=4, N=488.\n\nSo, floor((488 - 4)/10) + 1 = floor(484/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 4's in the units place.\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was 48, but this formula says 49. So, I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, units place for 4's: 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: same formula, floor((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = floor(480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in units place.\n\nNow, tens place:\n\nFor 4's in tens place: The ranges are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these contributes 10 4's in the tens place, except if the range is cut off by N=488.\n\nSo, 440-449 is within 488, so all 10 numbers are present. So, 5 ranges, each with 10 4's: 5\u00d710=50.\n\nFor 8's in tens place: The ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each of the first four ranges contributes 10 8's, and the last range contributes 9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers). So, 4\u00d710 + 9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nFor 8's: There are no page numbers from 800-899, so 0.\n\nSo, total 4's:\n\nUnits: 49\n\nTens: 50\n\nHundreds:89\n\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was 187, but now it's 188. Hmm, where did I go wrong before? Let me recount.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 48 before, but using the formula, it's 49. So, that's where the discrepancy was. So, total 4's: 49 + 50 +89=188.\n\nSimilarly, 8's:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:49\n\nHundreds:0\n\nTotal:98.\n\nSo, difference is 188 - 98=90.\n\nWait, now I'm getting 90 as the difference. But earlier I thought it was 89. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let's make sure.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\n- Units:49\n\n- Tens:50\n\n- Hundreds:89\n\nTotal:49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nCounting 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n\n- Tens:49\n\n- Hundreds:0\n\nTotal:98.\n\nSo, 188 -98=90.\n\nBut earlier, without using the formula, I thought units place for 4's was 48, leading to 187 total 4's, which would give a difference of 89. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let's manually check the units place for 4's.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nThe numbers are 4,14,24,...,484.\n\nSo, the first number is 4, and the last is 484.\n\nHow many terms? The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10 \u2264488.\n\nSo, 4 +10(n-1) \u2264488 \u219210(n-1) \u2264484 \u2192n-1 \u226448.4 \u2192n \u226449.4. So, n=49.\n\nSo, 49 terms, so 49 4's in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place, same calculation: 8,18,...,488.\n\n488 is included, so same as above, 49 terms.\n\nSo, units place for 4's is 49, not 48. So, my initial count was wrong; it's actually 49.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\n8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 89. So, where was I wrong before? I think I miscounted the units place for 4's as 48 instead of 49.\n\nSo, the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nTens place for 4's: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\n8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought it was 89. Let me try another approach to confirm.\n\nAlternative approach: For each page number from 1 to 488, count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nBut that's tedious, but perhaps I can think of it in terms of digit positions.\n\nFor each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 4's: floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 ends with 8, which is after 4, so we add 1 if 4 \u22648. Wait, no, the formula is floor((N - d)/10) +1 if d \u2264 N.\n\nSo, for d=4, N=488: floor((488-4)/10)=floor(484/10)=48, so 48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly for d=8: floor((488-8)/10)=floor(480/10)=48, so 48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4's: The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49). So, for 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 (since 400 is the 4th hundred). So, 4\u00d710=40. But wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49 in the 400-499 range, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 4 in 440-449 is still present. Wait, no, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49 in the 400s, which is 10 numbers (440-449). Wait, no, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, etc. Wait, no, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, which is 10 numbers, but 400-488 includes 400-409, so that's 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Similarly, in the 100s, 200s, 300s, each has a 40-49 range, which is 10 numbers each. So, that's 4 ranges (including 400-409), each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4\u00d710=40. But wait, earlier I thought it was 5\u00d710=50. Hmm, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the hundreds place with the tens place. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the tens place, the digit 4 appears in the ranges:\n\n- 040-049 (which is 40-49)\n\n- 140-149\n\n- 240-249\n\n- 340-349\n\n- 440-449\n\nSo, that's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50.\n\nBut wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 is only present in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 5 ranges, each with 10, so 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, the ranges are:\n\n- 080-089 (80-89)\n\n- 180-189\n\n- 280-289\n\n- 380-389\n\n- 480-488\n\nSo, 5 ranges, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, 4\u00d710 +9=49.\n\nSo, 4's in tens place:50, 8's:49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's:400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\n8's:0.\n\nSo, total 4's:49(units)+50(tens)+89(hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49(units)+49(tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 89, but after correcting the units place for 4's, it's 49, leading to 90.\n\nSo, I think the correct difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (1-488):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: floor((488 - 4)/10) + 1 = floor(484/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place (1-488):**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, except 440-449 which is fully within 488.\n   - Total: 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place (1-488):**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (1-488):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: floor((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = floor(480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place (1-488):**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four ranges contributes 10 occurrences, and 480-488 contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place (1-488):**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book only goes up to 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " But since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence, right? Let me check: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. That's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Oh, I see, I made a mistake earlier. So, actually, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many full hundreds we have. From 1-488, we have four full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, actually, 400-488 is part of the fifth hundred, but only up to 488. So, for the tens place, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-400, that's 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 again in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, no, that's not right. Because 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's an additional 10, making it 50. But wait, from 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100, each with 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so total is 40+10=50. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 occurrences. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 occurrences of 4. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each full hundred contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 1-400, we have four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total in the tens place is 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as pages go up to 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Wait, but 484 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 4 (which is the first), each 10 numbers add another. So, 4, 14, ..., 484 is 49 numbers. Let me check: from 4 to 484, how many steps of 10? The formula is ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid, but 480-489 would be beyond 488. Let me calculate how many full groups of 100 there are. Each hundred block (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. From 1-100: 40-49: 10 numbers. From 101-200: 140-149: 10 numbers. From 201-300: 240-249: 10 numbers. From 301-400: 340-349: 10 numbers. From 401-488: 440-449: 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, right? Because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50. Wait, but let me confirm: 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 times 10, which is 50. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. Wait, no: the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, I'm only interested in how many times the hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 times. Wait, but the hundreds digit is 4 for each number from 400 to 488, inclusive. So, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many numbers is that? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, using the formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is valid. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10, and the last set (480-488) contributes 9. So total in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because 90 seems a bit high, but maybe it's correct. Let me verify each count again. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges.\n   - Number of occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9.\n   - Number of occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

But wait, let me check: from 4 to 484, the number of 4's in the units place is actually (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, that makes sense because 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's valid. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 here, so how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. Let's calculate how many times. Using the same method as before: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only up to 488, so the tens digit is 8 from 480 to 488, but 488 is included. So, let's count each range: - 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). - 100-199: 180-189 (10). - 200-299: 280-289 (10). - 300-399: 380-389 (10). - 400-488: 480-488. Now, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, we have 4 ranges with 10 numbers each (80-89, etc.) and one range with 9 numbers (480-488). So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " But since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence, right? So that's 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0 to 488, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, but only the hundreds digit is 4. So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 times. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 89 numbers. Now, adding up the units, tens, and hundreds places for 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187 times. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last occurrence in the units place is 488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so actually, it's 49 times because 8 appears in 8, 18, ..., 488. Wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, the number of times 8 appears in units place is floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 is the 49th occurrence, maybe it's 49? Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8, so it's the 49th occurrence. Hmm, but wait, 8 is the 8th number, 18 is the 18th, ..., 488 is the 488th page. So, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 is exactly 48*10 + 8, so that's 49 times. Wait, no, because 8 is the first occurrence, 18 is the second, ..., 488 is the 49th. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, but the last range, 480-488, has only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? For 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the units, tens, and hundreds places for 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 times. Now, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the 4's: units place: from 4,14,...,484. The last number is 484, which is 484/10=48.4, so 48 times. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So total 48+50+89=187. Now for 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488/10=48.8, so 49 times. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Hundreds place: 0. So total 49+49=98. Therefore, 187-98=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.

    "text": " But since we can't have a fraction of a number, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 484 is the 49th occurrence because it starts counting from 4 as the first. Hmm, maybe I should think differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place up to a number N can be calculated by taking the floor of (N divided by 10) plus 1 if the units digit is greater than or equal to the digit we're counting. Wait, maybe that's complicating it. Alternatively, for each complete set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of 10 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8). Each set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, does the 48th set end at 480, and then we have 481-488, which includes 484, so that's an extra 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's would be 48 (from 1-480) plus 1 (484), totaling 49. Hmm, that seems right. Let me check: from 1-40, the units place 4's are at 4,14,24,34,44. That's 5 times, which is 40 \u00f7 10 = 4, plus 1 because 44 is included, so 5. Wait, but 40 \u00f7 10 is 4, but 44 is the fifth occurrence. So, maybe the formula is floor((N + 1)/10). Let me test that. For N=4, (4 +1)/10 = 0.5, floor is 0, which is wrong. Hmm, maybe another approach. Alternatively, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is equal to (N // 10) + (1 if N % 10 >= d else 0). So, for N=488, units place 4's: 488 // 10 = 48, and 488 % 10 = 8, which is >=4, so add 1. So total 49. Okay, so units place 4's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. The first is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's, so 5\u00d710=50. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, all 10 are included. So, tens place 4's: 5\u00d710=50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 4's: 89. Now, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let me count how many times. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many numbers? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because it starts at 8. Let me check using the formula: units place 8's: floor(488 / 10) = 48, and since 488 % 10 = 8 >=8, so add 1, total 49. So, units place 8's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, how many ranges? Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, 10 8's in tens place.\n- 180-189: 10 numbers.\n- 280-289: 10 numbers.\n- 380-389: 10 numbers.\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page).\n\nSo, that's 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, let me confirm. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, etc.) contributes 10 8's in the tens place. The last range, 480-488, contributes 9 8's in the tens place because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 4\u00d710 +9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because when I count the 8's in the tens place, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me double-check. Each time the tens digit is 8, it's a full range of 10 numbers, except possibly the last one if the book doesn't go up to the next hundred. So, for 80-89: 10 numbers, 10 8's in tens place.\n\nSimilarly, 180-189: 10 numbers.\n\n280-289: 10 numbers.\n\n380-389: 10 numbers.\n\n480-488: 9 numbers, so 9 8's in tens place.\n\nSo, that's 4\u00d710 +9=49, which matches what I had before.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the 8's in the tens place were 49, so total 8's would be 49+49=98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's was 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, when counting the 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's there.\n\nIn the tens place, 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449: each of these ranges contributes 10 4's in the tens place. That's 5 ranges, so 5\u00d710=50.\n\nIn the units place, 49 times.\n\nSo, 89+50=139, plus 49=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nTens place: 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal: 98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I overcounted somewhere.\n\nWait, in the units place for 4's: from 1-488, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 488 \u00f710=48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus the last partial set where 484 is included, so +1, total 49. That seems right.\n\nIn the tens place for 4's: each range of 100 numbers has 10 4's in the tens place. So, from 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100 (1-100,101-200,201-300,301-400), each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49 in each hundred, but wait, in 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0-8. So, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, which is 10 numbers, but 400-409 is within 488, so that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's: 4\u00d710 +10=50. That's correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place for 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nTens place: 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's:98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. From 80-89:10 numbers, 10 8's.\n\n180-189:10.\n\n280-289:10.\n\n380-389:10.\n\n480-488:9.\n\nSo, that's 4\u00d710 +9=49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 4 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4.\n   - Additionally, 484 adds one more 4.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - There are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Each range contributes 10 4's.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488.\n   - There are 89 numbers here (488 - 400 + 1).\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 8.\n   - Additionally, 488 adds one more 8.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - There are 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 8's.\n   - The range 480-488 contributes 9 8's.\n   - Total: (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " But since we're dealing with whole numbers, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 = 48*10 + 4. So, from 4 to 484, there are 49 numbers (including both endpoints). Let me check: 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 49. Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so in each set of 10, there's one 4 in the units place. So, the number of sets is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. Since we can't have a fraction of a set, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, in the last partial set from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which is the 49th occurrence. Hmm, maybe I should calculate it as (488 + 1) // 10. Let me use integer division: 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (484). So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges there are up to 488. The first is 40-49, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, the tens place 4's are 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and the last partial set from 481-488 includes 488, which is another 8. So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see how many such ranges there are up to 488. The first is 80-89, then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 4*10 = 40. But wait, is there another range beyond 380-389? 480-489 would be the next, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 480-488. So, does 480-488 count as a range where the tens digit is 8? Yes, because in 480-488, the tens digit is 8. So, that's another range. So, that's 5 ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), but the tens digit is still 8 for all of them. So, in the tens place, each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check again. The first four ranges are 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's 40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's 9 more. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the tens place for 8's again. When I considered 480-488, that's 9 numbers, right? So, 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, that's correct. So, 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one range of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place 8's are 49. Units place: 49, so total 8's are 49+49=98. So, yes, 98 8's. 4's are 188, so 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct. And in the tens place, 50 4's. Units place, 49. So, 89+50=139, plus 49=188. Yes, that adds up. For 8's, units and tens each have 49, so 98 total. So, the difference is 90. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding how many more 4's are printed than 8's.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   - The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - There are 49 occurrences (from 4 to 484 inclusive).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - The digit 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.  \n   - There are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\n**Total 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   - The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - There are 49 occurrences (from 8 to 488 inclusive).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.  \n   - There are 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 numbers, and the partial range 480-488 contributing 9 numbers.  \n   - Total: 4*10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.\n\n**Total 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " But since we can't have a fraction of a page, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence. So, that means there are 48 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where 4 is in the tens place. Let me count how many such ranges there are. Starting from 40-49 (that's one), then 140-149 (two), 240-249 (three), 340-349 (four), and 440-449 (five). So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. That would be 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 440-449, which is entirely within 488. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, the digit 4 appears 187 times. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48. But wait, 488 is included, so actually, it's 49 times because from 8 to 488, that's 49 numbers. Let me check: 8, 18, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let me count how many full ranges there are. 80-89 is one, 180-189 is two, 280-289 is three, 380-389 is four, and 480-488 is five. Each full range (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 numbers, but the last one (480-488) only contributes 9 numbers (since 489 is beyond 488). So, for the first four ranges, that's 4 * 10 = 40, and the last one is 9. So total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, zero times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 89. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check again, maybe I missed something. Wait, when counting the units place for 4's, I had 484 as the last occurrence, which is 48 times. But let me check: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier count. Oh no, I think I made a mistake here. Earlier, I thought units place for 4's was 48, but actually, it's 49. Because from 4 to 484, inclusive, is 49 numbers. So, that would mean I overcounted the 4's by 1. Let me correct that. So, units place for 4's: 49 times. Tens place: 50 times. Hundreds place: 89 times. So total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, that's different. Let me recalculate. Units place for 4's: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, (484 - 4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times. Similarly, for units place of 8's: 8,18,...,488. (488 -8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. So, correct. So, for 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, so now I get 90. But earlier I thought it was 89. Hmm, so where did I go wrong before? I think I initially miscalculated the units place for 4's, thinking it was 48 instead of 49. So, the correct number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90. Let me make sure I didn't make another mistake elsewhere. Let's check the tens place for 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. Units place: 49 times. So, total 4's: 188. For 8's: units place is 49, tens place is 49. Let's check the tens place for 8's: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, 8's total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, the answer should be 90. I think I made a mistake in my initial count for the units place of 4's, which led me to an incorrect difference of 89. After correcting that, the difference is 90. Let me just make sure there are no other mistakes. For example, in the hundreds place for 4's, from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89. Correct. So, yes, the difference is 90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is calculated by examining each digit position (units, tens, and hundreds). Similarly, the number of times the digit 8 appears is counted. \n\n- **Digit 4:**\n  - Units place: 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484)\n  - Tens place: 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449)\n  - Hundreds place: 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488)\n  - Total: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n- **Digit 8:**\n  - Units place: 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488)\n  - Tens place: 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488)\n  - Hundreds place: 0 occurrences\n  - Total: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSubtracting the number of 8's from the number of 4's gives 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

From 40-49 (40s), 140-149 (140s), 240-249 (240s), 340-349 (340s), and 440-449 (440s). That's 5 ranges. Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? Let me check. The book has 488 pages, so 449 is okay, but 450 is beyond. So, 440-449 is within 488. So, 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50 occurrences. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, the hundreds digit is 4, so each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up the number of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the first is 8, and the last is 488. Using the same formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let me check each range: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-488: how many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, we have 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only has 488 pages, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Adding up the number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range has 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This gives 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a page, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence, so that's correct. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the blocks are 40-49 (1 block), 140-149 (second block), 240-249 (third), 340-349 (fourth), and 440-449 (fifth). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440 is the 440th page, which is within 488, so yes, that's okay. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). But wait, let me check: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, it's 488, so units digit is 8. Let me calculate how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, then every 10 pages. The last one is 488. So, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. So, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me check if 480-489 is included, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of it. So, the blocks are: 80-89 (1 block), 180-189 (2nd), 280-289 (3rd), 380-389 (4th), and 480-488 (5th). Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 numbers, but for the tens place count, each block is 10 numbers, except the last one which is cut short. So, first four blocks are complete: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. The fifth block is 480-488, which has 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. 48+50=98, +89=187. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Yeah, that seems right. But wait, did I make a mistake in the tens place for 4's? Let me check again. For the tens place of 4's: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. For the units place of 4's: 4,14,...,484. The last one is 484, which is 484=4+10*(n-1), so n=(484-4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49? Wait, wait, earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recalculate. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first occurrence is at 4, then every 10 pages: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 times, not 48. So, I think I made a mistake earlier when I said 48. So, units place for 4's is 49, not 48. That changes things. So, let me correct that. So, units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, +89=188. So, total 4's are 188. Now, for 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total 98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, so the difference is 90 now. But wait, let me check again. So, the units place for 4's: 4,14,...,484. So, the number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 times. So, earlier I thought 48, but it's actually 49. So, 49 in units, 50 in tens, 89 in hundreds. 49+50=99, +89=188. So, 4's=188. 8's=49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I think I might have made another mistake. Let me check the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Correct. Now, let me check the tens place for 8's. I had 4 blocks of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus the 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49. Correct. Units place for 8's: 8,18,...,488. So, same as 4's, the number of terms is (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds. Total 98. So, 4's=188, 8's=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, I think I made a mistake in the units place for 4's earlier. Let me confirm: page 484 is included, so 484 is the last 4 in the units place. So, the count is correct at 49. So, yes, 4's=188, 8's=98, difference=90. So, the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 484 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me check: from 4 to 484, each 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place. So, 484 is the 49th such number because (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so does 440-449 fit? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first is 8, the last is 488. Let's find how many numbers: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count the ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4 * 10 = 40. But wait, does 380-389 fit? 389 is less than 488, so yes. So, 40 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, there are 89 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 89 = 99. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: Units: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. Total: 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. For 8's: Units: 49, Tens: 40, Hundreds: 0. Total: 49 + 40 = 89. Difference: 188 - 89 = 99. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 is correct. For the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 50, which is correct. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? Let's see: 484 is the last one. So, from 4 to 484, how many steps of 10? 484 - 4 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. Correct. So, 49 units, 50 tens, 89 hundreds. Total 188. For 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 - 8 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's 4 ranges, 4*10=40. Correct. Hundreds place: none. So, 49 + 40 = 89. So, 188 - 89 = 99. So, the answer should be 99 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers.

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence, but let me check: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The number of terms can be calculated by (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, that makes sense because 484 is the 49th term in this sequence. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 1-488, the possible tens ranges are 40-49 (which is within 1-488), 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, right? 449 is less than 488. So that's five ranges. Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. Wait, actually, in the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. But let's see: from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, that's 89 times in the hundreds place. Wait, but wait, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, but the hundreds digit is 4 for each of them, so 89 times. So, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in units? It's every 10 numbers, starting at 4. So, the number of terms is floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 ends with 8, the last 4 in units is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times. Tens place: Each block of 100 has a 4 in the tens place for 10 numbers. So, for 1-100, 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 101-200: 140-149: 10. 201-300: 240-249:10. 301-400: 340-349:10. 401-488: 440-449:10. Wait, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 times. Hundreds place: From 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, each with 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. So total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many such numbers. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's check each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers, but 80-89 is within 1-488, so 10 times. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289:10 numbers. - 380-389:10 numbers. - 480-488: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and one range of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 times. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me just cross-verify. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. Wait, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 is correct. For 8's, in the hundreds place, none, correct. Units place: 49 each, tens place: 49 for 8's and 50 for 4's. So, 4's:49+50+89=188, 8's:49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range contributes 10, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 numbers with 4 in the hundreds place.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This gives 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as the book doesn't reach 800.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " But since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 is 48*10 + 4. So, that's 48 times. But wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so the count is floor(488/10) = 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me calculate how many such blocks there are. From 1-400, there are 4 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), each contributing 10 numbers. So that's 4*10 = 40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. Wait, but wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since our book ends at 488, it's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see: the last occurrence is at 488, which is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 is 48*10 + 8. So, does that mean 49 times? Let me think: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, which means 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, and then an extra 8 in 488. So, 48 +1 =49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block of 100 contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see how many such blocks we have up to 488. From 1-400, we have 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Now, from 400-488, the next block would be 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have 40 (from 1-400) +9=49 times. Wait, but wait: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is included. So, that's correct. So, 40 +9=49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98 times. So, the number of 4's is 187 and the number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract 98 from 187: 187 -98=89. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, let me go through the 4's again. Units place: 48 times. Tens place: 50 times. Hundreds place: 89 times. Total: 48+50=98, plus 89=187. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's: Units place: 49 times. Tens place: 49 times. Hundreds place: 0. Total: 98 times.\n\nSo, 187 -98=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I was counting the 8's in the tens place, I thought it was 49, but let me check again. From 1-400, the tens digit 8 occurs in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49. That's correct.\n\nUnits place: 49 because 488 is included, so 488 is the 49th occurrence.\n\nSo, yes, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, totaling 98.\n\nSo, 187-98=89. So, 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 48 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, resulting in 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any page number up to 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** There are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

So, there are 48 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many such sets there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. Similarly, 240-249 and 340-349 each add 10, and 440-449 is another 10. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within the range. So, that's 5 sets of 10 numbers each. So, 5*10=50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, I'm only counting the hundreds digit here, which is 4 for all these numbers. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but the book stops at 488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, the sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. Let's solve for n: (n-1)*10 = 480 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n=49. So, there are 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. Let's count each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: since 488 is the last page, this is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4 +9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (4's) -98 (8's)=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " But since we can't have a fraction of a page, I take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 484 count as the 49th occurrence? Because 484 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 4. Let me check: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are up to 488. - 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So 5 x 10 = 50 occurrences. But wait, does 440-449 include page 440 to 449, which is 10 pages, so 10 occurrences. So, 5 ranges x 10 = 50. But wait, I'm not sure if 440-449 is fully included. Since the book goes up to 488, 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. Let me find how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive. 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me count how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same method: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let me check each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: Here, the tens digit is 8, but the units digits go from 0 to 8, so that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place, each full range contributes 10, except the last one which contributes 9. So, number of occurrences: 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each with 10, so 4x10=40, plus the last range 480-488 which has 9. So total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never is 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, occurring 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last range (480-488) contributing 9 occurrences, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit within 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are \\boxed{90} more 4's printed than 8's."

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 484 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me check: from 4 to 484, that's every 10 numbers, so the count is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them all up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many there are. The last number is 488, so (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place for 8. Let's check each block: - 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). - 100-199: 180-189 (10). - 200-299: 280-289 (10). - 300-399: 380-389 (10). - 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, we have 4 full blocks (each contributing 10) and one partial block contributing 9. So, total 4 x 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems right. For 8's in the tens place, I had 4 full blocks and one partial. Wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 4 full blocks (each 10) and one partial with 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. That's correct. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This gives 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence. So, from 4 to 484, that's 48 times. But wait, let me check: 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so the integer part is 48, but actually, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48 times because each 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range. So, yes, 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 40-49 (that's one), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's a total of 5 ranges. Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, and since the book goes up to 488, 449 is within range, so yes, all 5 ranges are valid. So, 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times. Wait, but 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, each of those 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, the first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. Let's see how many numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but wait, 488 is included, so from 8 to 488, that's 49 times. Wait, because 8 is the first, then 18, 28,..., 488. Let me count: 488 - 8 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 gives 49. So, 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such ranges are there? 80-89 is one, 180-189 is another, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. But wait, does 380-389 go up to 389, which is less than 488, so yes. So, 40 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 40 + 0 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the units place. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the number of terms is 49 because we start at 8 (which is the first term) and go up to 488, which is the 49th term. So, yes, 49 times.\n\nNow, the total number of 4's is 187, and the total number of 8's is 89. So, the difference is 187 - 89 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct.\n\nAnd for the 8's in the tens place, we have 4 ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each with 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. That seems correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 89 = 98. Therefore, there are 98 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

Occurrences: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 40 + 0 = 89.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (number of 4's) - 89 (number of 8's) = 98.\n\n\\boxed{98}"

But wait, that's not right because 484 is the 48th occurrence, but actually, it's 48 times 10 plus 4, so from 4 to 484, there are 49 numbers. Wait, no, because 4 to 484 in steps of 10: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is okay, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so we have to adjust. Let's see: Each hundred has a set of ten numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, each hundred contributes 10, and there are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). But wait, 400-488 is not a full hundred, but it's enough to include 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 5 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, 400-488 is actually 89 numbers, but the tens digit is 4 only from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 50 in total. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. But the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is included, so 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, hundreds place 4's: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 +50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, last is 488. So, (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but the book stops at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each hundred contributes 10, except the last one which contributes 9. Let's see: From 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199:180-189 (10). From 200-299:280-289 (10). From 300-399:380-389 (10). From 400-488:480-488 (9). So, total tens place 8's: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the difference is number of 4's minus number of 8's: 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " But since we can't have a fraction of a number, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence? Let me check: 4,14,24,...,484. The positions are 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. Oh, so there are 49 4's in the units place. Wait, that makes sense because from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488's units digit is 8, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which is the second digit. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. Starting from 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me check if 480-489 is within the book, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of it. So, let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: that's 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place, the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10, so 4*10=40. The last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total in the tens place is 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's one range. Then 140-149: another. 240-249: another. 340-349: another. 440-449: another. So, that's 5 ranges. Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last range, 440-449, is within 488, so all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers, meaning 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll follow the same approach, checking each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. To find how many, divide 488 by 10, which gives 48.8, so 48 full tens. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers because 8 appears 49 times in the units place. Wait, let me check: from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? Let's see: 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. So, let's count these ranges. - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: here, the tens digit is 8, but the numbers go from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 8's in the tens place for this range. So, total 8's in the tens place: 10 + 10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: Units place: 48, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. Total: 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49. Total: 98. So, 187-98=89. Wait, but when I thought about the tens place for 8's, I had 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4 ranges of 10 and one range of 9, so 10*4=40, plus 9=49. That seems right. Similarly, for 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's. So, the difference is indeed 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence, so maybe it's 48 times? Wait, let me check. The sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms can be found by ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count each set. - 40-49: That's 10 numbers, so 10 times. - 140-149: Another 10. - 240-249: 10. - 340-349: 10. - 440-449: 10. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, 5 sets of 10, which is 50 times. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. Let's see how many numbers that is. From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many times. The last number is 488, which is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 = 480/10 = 48. Adding 1 for the first term, we get 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count each set. - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. Now, 480-489 would be the next set, but since the book only goes up to 488, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but does 480-488 count as a full set? The tens digit is 8 from 480 to 489, but since the book ends at 488, we only have 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, yes, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

From 4 to 484, that's 48 numbers. But wait, 484 is the 48th number, but actually, when you count from 4 to 484 in steps of 10, how many terms are there? The formula is ((last - first)/step) + 1. So ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Wait, that's different. Hmm, maybe I should use this formula. So, for units place 4's: first term 4, last term 484, step 10. So number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 4 can appear in the tens place. That would be numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 540-549 isn't because 488 is less than 540. Let me count how many full groups of 100 there are. From 0-99: 40-49: 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149: 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249: 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349: 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449: 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So total in tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440 is 440, and 449 is 449, which is within 488, so yes, that's 10. So 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That's from 400 to 488. So the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 +50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's do the same for 8's. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 count? Yes, because 488 is page 488, so the units digit is 8. So first term 8, last term 488. Number of terms: ((488 -8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So 49 times 8 appears in units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place would be numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So let's break it down: - 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. - 100-199: 180-189: 10 numbers. - 200-299: 280-289: 10 numbers. - 300-399: 380-389: 10 numbers. - 400-488: 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. So 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So 0 times. Now, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0 = 98. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98 =90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " But since we can't have a fraction of a number, we'll take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence because starting from 4, every 10th number adds another 4 in the units place. But let me check: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 times. Hmm, but wait, 488 is included, so does that mean the last 4 in the units place is 484? Yes, because 488 is 8 in the units place. So, units place 4's: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is okay, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. Let's count how many sets of ten there are where the tens digit is 4. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers, so 10 times 4 appears in the tens place. Similarly, 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 occurrences, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in each of these, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 times. Wait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first, 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, hundreds place 4's: 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, meaning 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, units place 8's: 49 times? Wait, no, because starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one more 8. So, 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place 8's: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let's check each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 times 8 appears in the tens place. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: here, the tens digit is 8, but the numbers go from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in this case, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place 8's: 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's: units:48, tens:50, hundreds:89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems right. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, it's easy to miscount the number of times a digit appears in a range. Let me check the tens place for 4's again. From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place for 4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times. Correct. For 8's, units place:49 times, tens place:49 times. So, 98 total. So, 187-98=89. I think that's correct. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in sets of 10: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 occurrences, so 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 times.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in sets of 10: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The last set (480-488) has 9 numbers.\n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = **49** times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n- 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **89**.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 = 4 + (48-1)*10. Let me check: 4 + 10*(48-1) = 4 + 470 = 474. Hmm, that's not 484. Maybe I should think differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place from 1 to N can be calculated as floor(N/10) + 1 if the units digit is >= the target digit, but maybe it's better to think in terms of how many complete groups of 10 there are. From 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So that's 48 times. But wait, does 488 include an extra 4 in the units place? 488's units digit is 8, so no. So units place gives 48 fours. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit can be 4. This happens in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So 5*10 = 50 fours. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's correct. So tens place gives 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4. This happens from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488, which is correct. So hundreds place gives 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So total fours are 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the fours, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8. So units place gives 48 eights. But wait, 488 is included, so the last 8 in the units place is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Because from 1-480, there are 48 eights in the units place, and then 488 adds another one, making it 49. Wait, let me check: The first 8 is at 8, then 18, 28,..., 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So units place gives 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers with tens digit 8. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So total in tens place: 4 ranges *10 + 1 range*9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So hundreds place gives 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 187 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 89. So there are 89 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So 187-98=89. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 48 such occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges, each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in page numbers 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences (including 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. The first four ranges contribute 40, and 480-488 contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, starting from 4, every 10th number has a 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let me calculate: The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) in 488. That would be floor(488 / 10) = 48 times. But wait, the last number is 488, which is 48*10 + 8, so the 48th occurrence would be at 484. So, yes, 48 times. Wait, but let me check: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, which means 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, the 48th 4 would be at 484, which is correct. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 40-49, that's one range, then 140-149, another, and so on up to 440-449. Since the book goes up to 488, the last range is 440-449, which is within 488. So, how many ranges? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 times. Wait, but wait: does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This would be from 400-488. Each number here has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the number of 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. Wait, 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? Let's calculate: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full decades. But wait, the last number is 488, which is 488, so the 8 in the units place occurs at 488 as well. So, starting from 8, 18, ..., 488. So, how many numbers? 488 - 8 / 10 + 1? Wait, maybe a better way is to see that from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 times, but since 488 is included, that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 numbers, so 4 ranges * 10 = 40. Now, the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, that's 9 more. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up the number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so total 98. Hmm, but wait, let me check the tens place again. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, 49 in the tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's was 187, and the number of 8's was 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, for the 4's:\n\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nHmm, but I'm wondering if I made a mistake in counting the 4's in the tens place. Let me recount that. The 4 in the tens place occurs in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. So that's five ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct.\n\nWait, but when I counted the 8's in the tens place, I had 49 because the last range was 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4 ranges of 10 and one of 9, totaling 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place for 8 again. From 8, 18, 28,...,488. How many terms? Let's see: The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 +1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the units place: from 4 to 484, step 10. So, ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Wait, wait, that contradicts my earlier count. Earlier, I thought units place for 4's was 48, but now I'm seeing it's 49.\n\nWait, let me clarify. If I use the formula, the number of terms from a to b with step d is ((b - a)/d) +1.\n\nSo, for 4's in units place: a=4, b=484, d=10.\n\n(484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49.\n\nSo, that's 49 times, not 48. So, I think I made a mistake earlier when I said 48 times. It should be 49 times. So, that changes the total number of 4's.\n\nWait, so let me correct that.\n\nSo, for 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 +50=99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nWait, 49 +50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\nTotal:98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that's different from my initial calculation. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by miscalculating the units place for 4's. It should be 49, not 48.\n\nLet me confirm again: from 4 to 484, step 10. So, 4,14,24,...,484.\n\nNumber of terms: (484 -4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Yes, that's correct. So, units place for 4's is 49, not 48. So, total 4's is 49+50+89=188.\n\nSimilarly, 8's are 49+49=98.\n\nSo, difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, for 4's in the units place, 484 is the last one, which is within 488, so that's correct. Similarly, for 8's in the units place, 488 is included, so that's 49.\n\nSo, the correct count for 4's is 188, 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count any numbers. For example, is there any overlap where a page number has both 4 and 8? Well, when counting digits, each digit is counted separately, so even if a number has both, each digit is counted. So, for example, 48 would have a 4 in the tens place and an 8 in the units place, so both are counted.\n\nAnother thing to check: in the hundreds place, for 4's, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, correct. 488-400+1=89.\n\nIn the hundreds place for 8's, since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nWait, let me also check the tens place for 4's. The ranges are 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's five ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50 numbers. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's five ranges, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, I think the correct counts are:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference was 89, but after correcting the units place for 4's, it's 90.\n\nWait, let me just confirm once more.\n\nUnits place for 4's: from 4,14,...,484: 49 numbers.\n\nTens place for 4's: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449: 5 ranges, 10 each, 50.\n\nHundreds place for 4's:400-488:89.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nUnits place for 8's:8,18,...,488:49.\n\nTens place for 8's:80-89,180-189,...,480-488:49.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " But since we can't have a fraction of a page, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. So, there are 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, but 484 is the last one, so actually, 484 is the 48th occurrence. Let me check: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms can be calculated as (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Oh, I made a mistake earlier. It should be 49 times. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 occurrences. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours printed. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. Let's calculate the number of terms. The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, let's count each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, there are 98 eights printed.

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence because starting from 4, each 10 pages adds one more. So, there are 48 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many sets of ten there are. Each set has 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 4's in the tens place. From 40-49: that's 10 pages. Similarly, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's. So, 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but hold on, does 440-449 go up to 449? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 ends with an 8, so that's included. To find how many such numbers there are, I can divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48, but wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me think. The first 8 is at page 8, then 18, 28,... up to 488. So, how many numbers? Let's see: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488). So, let's count each set. 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 +9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but since the book has only 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are there than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. By analyzing each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately, we find that the digit 4 appears 187 times, while the digit 8 appears 98 times. Subtracting these gives the difference.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{89}."

    "text": " But since we can't have a fraction of a page, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, let me check: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set would be 440-449. Let's count how many sets there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so all 5 sets are valid. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the number of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, let me check the addition: 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. So, 188 times 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let's check each set. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. Now, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, the first four sets are 10 each, and the last set is 9. So total is 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times 8 appears in the hundreds place. Adding up the number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. This is 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. This is 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This is 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488. This is 0 times.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " But since we can't have a fraction of a number, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 = 4 + (48-1)*10. So, there are 48 times when 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many complete blocks of 100 there are. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block (401-488). In each complete block, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so 4 blocks give 4*10 = 40. Now, in the partial block (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's 10 numbers. So, total in tens place is 40 + 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. That's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). But wait, let me check: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Adding up all the places: Units: 48, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. Total 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The last one is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full occurrences. Wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 is the 49th number in the units place with 8. Wait, no, let me think again. The first 8 is at 8, then every 10 after that. So, the number of 8's in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48. But wait, 488 is included, so actually, it's 49? Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th occurrence because it's the 48th multiple of 10 plus 8. Wait, let me list them: 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 8's. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block of 100 has 10 such numbers. There are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10, so 4*10=40. Now, the partial block is 401-488. In this range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, in the tens place, we have 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0. Adding up all the places: Units: 49, Tens: 49, Hundreds: 0. Total 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 187 - 98 = 89.

    "text": " But since we're dealing with whole numbers, there are 48 occurrences. Wait, but let me check: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in 488 numbers, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, that's 48 fours. But wait, 488 itself ends with an 8, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is within the 48th group. So, yes, 48 fours in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 fours. But wait, what about the last block, 401-488? The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's another 10 fours. So, in total, 4 blocks * 10 = 40, plus the 10 in 440-449, making it 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, no, because 401-488 is the fifth block, but only up to 488. So, in the fifth block, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, the total tens place fours would be 4 blocks (1-400) giving 4*10=40, plus 10 in 440-449, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 401-488 is the fifth block, but since 488 is less than 500, we don't have a full 100 numbers there. However, the tens digit being 4 occurs in 440-449, which is within 401-488, so that's 10 more fours. So, total tens place fours: 4*10 + 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but let me check: 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, yes, 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total number of fours is 187. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8. So, 48 eights. But wait, 488 itself ends with an 8, so the last occurrence is at 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me think: the first 8 is at 8, which is the first group (1-10). The next is 18, which is the second group (11-20), and so on. So, in 488 numbers, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's the same as the number of times 8 is in the units digit, which is floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49. Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th occurrence. Let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Each full block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers), 101-200: 180-189 (10), 201-300: 280-289 (10), 301-400: 380-389 (10), and 401-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last). So, the first four blocks contribute 10 each, so 4*10=40. The fifth block (401-488) contributes 9 eights in the tens place (480-488). So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never is 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total number of eights is 98. Now, to find how many more fours than eights: 187 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=48+50=98+89=187. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, but let me think again about the units place for fours. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, starting at 4. So, 4,14,24,...,484. The last one is 484, which is 484=4+10*(n-1). So, n= (484-4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Wait, so I think I made a mistake earlier. I thought units place fours were 48, but actually, it's 49. Because from 4 to 484, that's 49 numbers. Similarly, for eights in the units place, it's 49 as well. So, let me correct that. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=49+50=99+89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but now I'm confused because I thought the units place for fours was 48, but it's actually 49. Let me clarify. When counting the number of times a digit appears in the units place, it's equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus one if the last number in the range ends with that digit. So, for fours in units place up to 488: the last number is 488, which ends with 8, so the last 4 in units place is 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units fours=49. Similarly, for eights in units place, the last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units eights=49. Now, for fours in the tens place: from 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each block of 100 has one block of 10 with 4 in the tens place. From 1-400, there are 4 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349). Each contributes 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 fours. So, total tens fours=40+10=50. So, fours in tens place=50. For hundreds place fours: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers (488-400+1=89), each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds fours=89. So, total fours=49+50+89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. So, total eights=98. Therefore, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 89, but now it's 90. Let me make sure. Let me recount the fours in the units place. From 4 to 484, stepping by 10: that's (484-4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units fours=49. Similarly, units eights=49. Tens fours=50, as before. Hundreds fours=89. So, total fours=49+50+89=188. Eights: units=49, tens=49, so total=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because earlier I thought it was 89, but now it's 90. Let me check the tens place for eights again. For eights in the tens place: from 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. Each full block (80-89, 180-189, etc.) contributes 10 eights. How many full blocks are there? From 1-400: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights: 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, that's 9 eights. So, total tens eights=40+9=49. So, units eights=49, tens eights=49, total=98. So, fours=188, eights=98, difference=90. I think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - The number of such occurrences is calculated as:  \n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\text{ (complete groups of 10)}  \n     \\]  \n     Since 488 ends with 8, the last occurrence is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence.  \n     **Total units place 4's:** 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences.  \n   - From 1-400, there are 4 such blocks:  \n     \\[\n     4 \\times 10 = 40 \\text{ (tens place 4's)}  \n     \\]  \n   - In 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, contributing another 10.  \n     **Total tens place 4's:** 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488.  \n   - The number of such numbers is:  \n     \\[\n     488 - 400 + 1 = 89  \n     \\]  \n     **Total hundreds place 4's:** 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 50 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 89 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - The number of such occurrences is:  \n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\text{ (complete groups of 10)}  \n     \\]  \n     Since 488 ends with 8, it is the 49th occurrence.  \n     **Total units place 8's:** 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   - Each full block (80-89, 180-189, etc.) contributes 10 occurrences.  \n   - From 1-400, there are 4 such blocks:  \n     \\[\n     4 \\times 10 = 40 \\text{ (tens place 8's)}  \n     \\]  \n   - In 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, contributing 9 occurrences.  \n     **Total tens place 8's:** 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n     **Total hundreds place 8's:** 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 49 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 0 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 98\n\\]\n\n**Difference between the number of 4's and 8's:**  \n\\[\n188 \\, (\\text{4's}) - 98 \\, (\\text{8's}) = 90\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, we're only interested in the hundreds digit being 4, so each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers. For example, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8 is the 1st, 18 is the 2nd, ..., 488 is the 49th. Wait, no, because 8,18,...,488 is every 10 numbers starting at 8. So, how many terms are there? Let's calculate: The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The nth term is 8 + 10(n-1). We want 8 + 10(n-1) \u2264 488. So, 10(n-1) \u2264 480, so n-1 \u2264 48, so n \u2264 49. So, there are 49 numbers where 8 is in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 numbers, and the last block contributes 9. So, total in the tens place is 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, the total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a page, we'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 484 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me check. Starting from 4, every 10 pages, so 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many numbers in each hundred have 4 in the tens place. - For 40-49: that's 10 numbers. - For 140-149: another 10. - Similarly, 240-249: 10. - 340-349: 10. - 440-449: 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, last is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count how many. - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. Now, 480-489 would be the next set, but our book ends at 488, so only 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 10 +10 +10 +9 = 39. Wait, let me double-check that. From 80-89: 10. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So yes, 10+10+10+10+9=49? Wait, no, 10+10+10+10=40, plus 9 is 49. Wait, no, that's 40 +9=49. Wait, but earlier, I thought it's 39, but now I'm getting 49. Wait, no, wait: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's:49. Wait, but earlier, I thought 480-488 is 9, so 4 sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) plus 9, which is 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as pages go up to 488 \u2192 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 484 count? Let me check: 484 is within 488, so yes, it counts. So, from 4 to 484, that's 49 numbers (including both 4 and 484). Wait, no, because when you divide 484 by 10, you get 48.4, which means there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing a 4 in the units place, plus one more for the 484. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 times. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as (488 // 10) + 1 if the last number is within the range. Alternatively, maybe a better way is to calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place. For each complete set of 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, there are 488 // 10 = 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, check if the last partial set (if any) includes a 4. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so the last partial set is 480-488. In this set, the units digits go from 0 to 8, so 4 appears once (at 484). So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges exist within 1 to 488. The ranges are 40-49 (which is 10 numbers), 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, how many such ranges are there? From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, total 4's in tens place: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400 to 488. Each number here has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's printed. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers are there? Let's see: the first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Alternatively, 488 // 10 = 48, but since 488 ends with an 8, we add 1, so 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, let's count how many such ranges are within 1-488. The ranges are 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the first four ranges, each contributes 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last range contributes 9 numbers. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " But since we're dealing with whole numbers, there are 48 occurrences. Wait, actually, from 4 to 484, how many steps of 10 are there? Let me think. The formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there? From 1-100: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 101-200: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 201-300: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 301-400: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 401-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, how many blocks? From 1-400, there are 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 numbers. That's 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, we have another 10 numbers (440-449). So, total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488. Using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 8. Let's see how many such blocks we have. From 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 101-200: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 201-300: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 301-400: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 401-488: 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, in the 401-488 block, only 9 numbers have 8 in the tens place. So, total in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (from 1-400) = 40, plus 9 in 401-488. So, 40 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book has only 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\text{ (from 4 to 480)}  \n     \\]  \n     Adding the last occurrence at 484:  \n     \\[\n     48 + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences.  \n   - From 1-400: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40  \n   - From 401-488: 440-449 contributes 10  \n   - Total:  \n     \\[\n     40 + 10 = 50\n     \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488.  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n     \\]\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 50 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 89 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\text{ (from 8 to 488)}  \n     \\]  \n     Adding the last occurrence at 488:  \n     \\[\n     48 + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block which ends at 488.  \n   - From 1-400: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40  \n   - From 401-488: 480-488 contributes 9  \n   - Total:  \n     \\[\n     40 + 9 = 49\n     \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     0\n     \\]\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 49 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 0 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 98\n\\]\n\n**Difference:**  \n\\[\n188 \\, (\\text{number of 4's}) - 98 \\, (\\text{number of 8's}) = 90\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\[\n\\boxed{90}\n\\]"

    "text": " But since we can't have a fraction of a page, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. So, there are 48 4's in the units place. Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence. Let me check: 4, 14, ..., 484. The number of terms can be calculated by (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Oh, I think I made a mistake earlier. So, actually, there are 49 4's in the units place. Hmm, I need to be careful here. Let me think again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48. But then, in the incomplete group from 481 to 488, we have 484, which is another 4 in the units place. So, total 48 + 1 = 49. Yes, that's correct. So, 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449, and then maybe 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the last group is 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the tens place 4's? Let me clarify. The tens digit is 4 in the ranges where the tens digit is 4. So, the first such range is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. After that, the next would be 540-549, but since the book only goes up to 488, we don't include that. So, how many such ranges are there? From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, the last range is 440-449, and after that, the next would be 540-549, which is beyond 488. So, 5 ranges, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. That happens in the pages from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, let me add up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 = 99, then 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Let me go through each digit place again. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me count how many. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. Using the same method as before: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, in the incomplete group, 481-488 includes 488, which is another 8. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. This occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. So, how many ranges? 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 ranges. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 8's in the tens place, but the last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, no: from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, each of the first four ranges has 10 8's, and the last range has 9 8's. So, total 8's in the tens place: (4 * 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. That would be pages from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (from 4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in pages 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (from 8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last range being 480-488, totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a page, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, let me check. From 4 to 484, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? The sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Oh, I see, I made a mistake earlier by just taking the integer part. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place, the 4 can appear in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 0-488, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, the last block is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Wait, no, that's the total count, but we're only interested in the hundreds digit being 4. So, every number from 400 to 488 has 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see: 80-89 is within 488, 180-189 is also within, 280-289, 380-389. So that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 4 * 10 = 40. Wait, but 80-89 is 10 numbers, same for the others. So, 40 occurrences. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (40) = 89. So, 89 times the digit 8 appears. Now, subtracting the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 89 = 99. So, there are 99 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.
