    "text": " So, the sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term is 4, the common difference is 10, and the last term is 484. To find the number of terms, I can use the formula: number of terms = ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. Plugging in the numbers: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's look at the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such ranges there are. Starting from 40-49: that's one range. Then 140-149: another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within the 488 pages, so that's valid. So, how many ranges? From 40-49 up to 440-449, that's 5 ranges. Each range contributes 10 occurrences, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is the fifth range, right? Let me check: 40-49 (1), 140-149 (2), 240-249 (3), 340-349 (4), 440-449 (5). Yes, five ranges. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, 449 is less than 488. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but let me make sure. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, checking each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, the sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many terms. First term is 8, last term is 488, common difference 10. Number of terms = ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place. The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is within the book. The book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is included. So, how many ranges? 80-89 (1), 180-189 (2), 280-289 (3), 380-389 (4), and 480-488 (5). Each of the first four ranges contributes 10 occurrences, but the last one (480-488) only has 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive, which is 9 numbers). Wait, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, so in the tens place, the 8 appears 9 times here. So, let's calculate: 80-89: 10 times, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9. So, total is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10*4 + 9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place. The 8 can only appear in the hundreds place if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 0 occurrences of 8. So, total 8's are units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. I said that 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. But wait, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8, right? So, 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, yes, 49 in tens place. So, total 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought 488 would have an 8 in the units place, but that's already counted in the units place count. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Also, for the 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. So, I think the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, except 440-449, which is fully within 488.\n   - Total: 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four ranges contributes 10, and the last contributes 9.\n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers in the 800s, so 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set would be 440-449, because 450-488 doesn't have 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many full decades there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one set, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50. Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 here. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488 inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the tens place. Wait, from 40-49: 10 numbers, yes. 140-149: another 10, so 20. 240-249: 30. 340-349: 40. 440-449: 50. So, 50 in the tens place. Units: 49, as before. Hundreds: 89. So total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many? Using the same formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but since the book ends at 488, we only go up to 488. So, let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: how many? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place, it's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and then 9 more in 480-488. So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, total 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. For the 4's: Units: 4,14,...,484. That's 484/10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each set is 10, and there are 5 sets, so 50. Hundreds: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For the 8's: Units: 8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, so 49 numbers. Tens: 80-89,180-189, etc., up to 480-488. That's 4 full sets (80-89, etc.) and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 4*10+9=49. Hundreds: 0. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). \n     - Calculation: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49 times.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n     - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n     - Calculation: 5 * 10 = 50 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488.\n     - Calculation: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 times.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n     - Calculation: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49 times.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n     - There are 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 10 each, and 480-488 contributes 9.\n     - Calculation: (4 * 10) + 9 = 49 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n     - Calculation: 0 times.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - **Difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 90 times more than the digit 8.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can calculate how many groups of 10 there are in 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're dealing with whole groups, there are 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last group would be 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the units digit 4 appears in 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times. But wait, actually, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades. Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. Starting from 40-49, that's the first set. Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? From 1 to 488, the number of 8's in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, which is 488, so the units digit is 8 there, so that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me think again. If I have 488 pages, how many times does the units digit 8 appear? It's the same as the number of times 8 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. Each set of 10 numbers has exactly one 8 in the units place. So, the number of such sets is 488//10 = 48, and since 488 is exactly the last number, which is 48*10 + 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, because 488 is the 48th group plus one more. Wait, let's see: from 1-10: 8 is once. 11-20: once, etc. So, up to 480, there are 48 groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in 481-488, the units digit 8 is at 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, total 49 times. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except the last one, which only goes up to 488, so 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers, since 488 is the last). Wait, no: 480-489 is 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 8's in the tens place, and the last range (480-488) has 9 8's in the tens place. So, total for tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above. But since the book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, zero 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** \n   - 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such ranges.\n   - Number of occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 49 times (since 488 is included).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last range contributes 9.\n   - Number of occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book has only 488 pages.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **89**\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can calculate how many sets of 10 are there up to 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. Let me check: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is the 48th set (48*10=480) plus 8, so the units digit 4 appears 48 times? Wait, no, because 488 is 488, so the units digit 4 would be at 4,14,...,484. So, 484 is 48*10 + 4, so that's 48 times. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set would be 440-449, which is within 488. Let's count how many such sets there are. Each set contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, how many sets? From 0-99: 40-49 is one set. 100-199: 140-149. 200-299: 240-249. 300-399: 340-349. 400-488: 440-449. So that's 5 sets. Each set has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 page numbers. Therefore, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many times. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 is 48*10 + 8, so that's 48 full sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers. So, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, 488 is less than 480+89=489, so the last set is 380-389. Let's count the sets: 0-99: 80-89 (1 set). 100-199: 180-189. 200-299: 280-289. 300-399: 380-389. So, that's 4 sets. Each set contributes 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. So, 40 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place for pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 48 + 40 + 0 = 88. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 88 = 99. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units 48, tens 40, hundreds 0. 48+40=88. So, 187-88=99. Hmm, seems right. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 48 such occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449, totaling 5 sets of 10, giving 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 48 such occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 380-389, totaling 4 sets of 10, giving 40 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n\nTotal 8's: 48 + 40 = 88.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 88 (8's) = 99.\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{99}."

Wait, but let me check: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 480-489 is beyond 488, so up to 488. Let me calculate how many times 4 appears in the tens place. For each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, in the 100s, it's 40-49: 10 numbers. In the 200s: 140-149: 10. In the 300s: 340-349: 10. In the 400s: 440-449: 10. Now, from 450-488, the tens digit doesn't go back to 4, so I don't need to add more. So that's 4 sets of 10, totaling 4*10=40 times. Wait, but let me make sure. Wait, in the 400s, 440-449 is correct, but 450-488: the tens digit is 5,6,7,8, so no more 4's in the tens place. So, 40 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 40 = 89, plus 89 is 178. Wait, 49 + 40 is 89, plus 89 is 178. So, 178 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's calculate how many times. The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. Using the same formula: (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count how many times. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, in 100s: 80-89: 10 numbers. 200s: 180-189: 10. 300s: 380-389: 10. 400s: 480-488: let's see, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+9=39 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (39) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 39 = 88 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 178 (4's) - 88 (8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 40, hundreds 89. 49 + 40 is 89, plus 89 is 178. Correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 39. 49 + 39 is 88. Correct. So, 178 - 88 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. I had 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+9=39. That seems right. So, yes, 39 in the tens place. Units place: 49, correct. So, 88 total 8's. 4's are 178. So, 178-88=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.

Wait, but wait, 488 is the last page. So, does 484 exist? Yes, because 484 is less than 488. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 would go up to 449, and since the book has 488 pages, 440-449 is still within the range. Let me count how many such blocks there are. Each block is 10 numbers, and each block contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, from 40-49: 10 numbers, 10 times. From 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, 449 is less than 488, so all these blocks are valid. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times. Now, I need to count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. Using the same formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1= 48 +1=49 times. Wait, but 488 is included, so that's correct. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be the next, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of it. So, let's count the blocks. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 10 times. From 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 times, so 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 contributes 9 times. So, total in the tens place is 40 +9=49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) =90. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me double-check my calculations. For the 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For the 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. 4*10=40, +9=49. So, that's correct. So, 98 8's. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me recount the 4's in the hundreds place: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's. That's correct. And in the tens place, 5 blocks: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each has 10 4's, so 5*10=50. Units place: 49 times. So, 89+50+49=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. So, 98. So, 188-98=90.

Let me check: 484 is within 488, so yes, 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, but 488 is 8 in the units place. So, yes, 48 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, so that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another, another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, another 10. 300-399: 340-349, another 10. 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers as well because 449 is less than 488. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is fully included in 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This happens in the range 400-488. Each number here has 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. How many times? Using the same formula: floor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10) = 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's correct. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these has 10 numbers. Let's count the ranges: 0-99: 80-89, 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189, 10. 200-299: 280-289, 10. 300-399: 380-389, 10. Now, 400-488: The next would be 480-489, but since our book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of this range. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), because 489 is beyond 488. So, in the hundreds place for 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have 4 ranges with 10 each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one partial range with 9 numbers (480-488). So total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, 97 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract: 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the Digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units Place (1s):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\).\n\n2. **Tens Place (10s):**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers; there are 5 such ranges.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds Place (100s):**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 \\).\n\n**Counting the Digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units Place (1s):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\).\n\n2. **Tens Place (10s):**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Complete ranges: 4, each contributing 10 numbers.\n   - Partial range (480-488): 9 numbers.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds Place (100s):**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 48 + 49 + 0 = 97 \\).\n\n**Difference:**\n\\( 187 - 97 = 90 \\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

But wait, each group contributes exactly one 4 in the units place, except maybe the last group if it doesn't complete. Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the last complete group is 480-488.

Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 1-99), 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, but for the tens place, when the hundreds digit is 0, it's 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, when hundreds digit is 1, it's 140-149, another 10. Similarly for 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449: the last number is 449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 4's. Now, let me add up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 1 to 488, how many groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So that's 48 8's. Wait, but 488 is included, so does that mean the last group is 480-488, which includes 488. So, yes, 48 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. So, let's see how many such ranges there are. For each hundreds digit (0,1,2,3,4), we have a range where the tens digit is 8. So, 0 (80-89), 1 (180-189), 2 (280-289), 3 (380-389), and 4 (480-488). Each of these contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which is only 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 480-488 is 9 numbers? Wait, 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, etc.) each have 10 numbers, and the last one (480-488) has 9 numbers. So, total 8's in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers. So yes, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, let's add up the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, total 8's are 97. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract 97 from 187: 187 - 97 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 48 such occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 5 ranges \u00d7 10 numbers = 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 48 such occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 4 full ranges \u00d7 10 numbers = 40, plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 48 + 49 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

But wait, does 484 count as the 49th? Let me check: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Yes, that's correct. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within the range. Let me count how many numbers in each of these ranges: Each range has 10 numbers, except maybe the last one if it exceeds 488. But 440-449 is 10 numbers, and 440 is less than 488, so that's fine. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's okay. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99? Let me check: 40 + 50 is 90, plus 9 is 99. Yes. Then 99 + 89: 90 + 80 = 170, 9 + 9 = 18, so 170 +18=188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this range. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers except the last one, which has 9 numbers (480-488). Let me count: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So, total in the tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) -98 (8's) =90.

So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many full decades there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Similarly, each subsequent set (140-149, etc.) also has 10 numbers. How many such sets are there? Let's see: 40-49 is in the 0-99 range, then 140-149 in 100-199, 240-249 in 200-299, 340-349 in 300-399, and 440-449 in 400-488. Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 5 sets each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 5*10 = 50 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but 488 is included, so that's correct. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is within 488. 480-489 would be up to 488, so that's another range. So, how many such ranges? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 +1 = 9). Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 9 numbers. So, total in the tens place: 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480 is the first, then 481, 482, ..., 488. So, that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 times in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

From 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, another 10. 300-399: 340-349, another 10. 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 400-488. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up the number of 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's.

From 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can only appear in the hundreds place if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only has 488 pages, there are no numbers in the hundreds place with 8.

Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, how many such blocks are there? From 40-49 (in 1-100), then 140-149 (101-200), 240-249 (201-300), 340-349 (301-400), and 440-449 (401-500). Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 401-488. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. So, any page number from 400 to 488 has 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive. The count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers. The first term is 8, last term is 488. Using the same formula: a_n = 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, 488 - 8 = 480 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. That would be 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count each block. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: how many? 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1=9. Wait, no: 480 is the first, 481 is the second, up to 488, which is the 9th number. So, 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is from 800 to 899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. There are 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. There are 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's appear here.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " To find the total count, I can use the formula: (Last occurrence - First occurrence) / Interval + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 484 is the 49th occurrence. Hmm, but wait, 484 is the 49th number where 4 is in the units place? Let me check. From 4 to 484, that's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid, but 540-549 would be beyond 488, so we don't need to consider that. So, how many sets of ten are there where the tens digit is 4? Let's see: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 +89= 188. Wait, 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many such numbers. The first is 8, last is 488. So, (488 -8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but the book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is valid. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 full sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds=49+49+0=98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's)=90.

    "text": " The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. To find how many terms there are, I can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. Here, the first term is 4, the last term is 484, and the common difference is 10. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count each block: - 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place. - 140-149: Another 10. - 240-249: Another 10. - 340-349: Another 10. - 440-449: Another 10. So, that's 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. However, I need to check if 440-449 is within the page limit of 488. 440-449 is definitely within 488, so that's fine. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many terms there are. The first term is 8, the last term is 488. Common difference is 10. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let me check each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's. - 180-189: Another 10. - 280-289: Another 10. - 380-389: Another 10. - 480-488: How many numbers here? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, that's 9 8's in the tens place. So, total for tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. Wait, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. And for the tens place, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d710=50. That's correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's, units place: 49, which is correct because 8,18,...,488. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10\u00d74=40, plus 9=49. So, total 49 in units and 49 in tens, so 98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4, 14, 24, ..., 484\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449\n   - Each block contributes 10 4's, totaling 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 400-488\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8, 18, 28, ..., 488\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488\n   - First four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9, totaling 49\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No pages from 800-899 exist, so 0\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

To find how many terms are in this sequence, I can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: a_n = a_1 + (n-1)*d, where d is the common difference, which is 10 here. Let me solve for n when a_n = 484. 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 4: 480 = (n-1)*10. Divide by 10: 48 = n-1. So, n = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, but let me check: from 4 to 484, that's 49 numbers, right? Because 484 is the 49th term. Okay, so 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set would be 440-449, because 450-488 would have 4 in the hundreds place but not in the tens. Let me calculate how many numbers have 4 in the tens place. Each hundred block (like 1-99, 100-199, etc.) has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-99, it's 40-49: 10 numbers. From 100-199, it's 140-149: 10 numbers. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 50 occurrences. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 occurrences. But wait, let me check: 400 is included, and 488 is the last page. So, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up the number of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Using the same formula: a_n = 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, 8 + 10(n-1) = 488. Subtract 8: 10(n-1) = 480. Divide by 10: n-1 = 48. So, n = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. Wait, but let me check: 488 is included, so that's correct. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's calculate each set. From 1-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189: 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289: 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389: 10 numbers. From 400-488: 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, adding them up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, when counting the hundreds place for 4's, I included 400-488, which is 89 numbers. But wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct? Because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So that's correct.\n\nFor the 8's in the tens place, I had 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). That's 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nFor the 4's in the tens place, I had 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each 10, so 50.

Let me think again.\n\nWait, when counting the hundreds place for 4's, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So that's 89. That's correct.\n\nFor 8's, in the tens place, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 49 in total. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I missed any 8's in the hundreds place. Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can't be 8. So, no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nHmm, seems like my calculation is correct.

    "text": " To find how many, I can divide 484 by 10, which gives 48.4, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 is 48*10 + 4. So, there are 48 4's in the units place. Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence? Let me check. The first 4 is at 4, then every 10 pages. So, 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Oh, I made a mistake earlier. It's actually 49 times. Because from 4 to 484, inclusive, stepping by 10, the number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set would be 440-449. Let's count how many such sets there are. Each set has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. The first set is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10. 240-249, another 10. 340-349, another 10. 440-449, another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, all these sets are valid. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be numbers from 400-488. Wait, but in the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 +50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's printed are 188. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 =48 +1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's check each set. - 80-89: 10 numbers, 80-89. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, because 488-480+1=9). So, the first four sets contribute 10 each, and the last set contributes 9. So total in the tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's printed are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Sets: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 numbers, so 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Numbers: 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Sets: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four sets contribute 10 each, and the last set contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers in the book have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can calculate how many groups of 10 there are from 1 to 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit 4 appears in 484, which is within the 480-489 range, but since we're only going up to 488, that's fine. So, 48 times. Wait, but when I count from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10, so from 1-10: one 4, 11-20: one 4, and so on. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction, it's 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, and then in the 481-488 range, we have 484, which is another 4. So that's 48 + 1 = 49 times? Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, and 484 is within 481-488, so maybe it's 48 times because each 10 has one 4, and 488 is the 48th group of 10? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete tens plus any extra in the last partial ten. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete tens, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and in the last partial ten (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which adds one more 4. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10. From 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10. From 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10. From 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This happens in the range 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. So, total 4's in the hundreds place: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. So, 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. Hmm, but let me think again. Wait, when I'm counting the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct. For the tens place, each of the five decades (40-49, 140-149, etc.) contributes 10, so 5*10=50. That seems right. Units place: every 10 numbers, so 48 full groups (1-480) and then 484, so 49. Okay, so total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so in the last group (481-488), the units digit 8 is at 488. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does that mean the units digit 8 appears 49 times? Let me check: from 1-480, there are 480 numbers, so 480 / 10 = 48. Then, 481-488 includes 488, which is another 8 in the units place. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This occurs in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except possibly the last one if it's cut short. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: Here, the tens digit is 8, but the units digit goes from 0 to 8, so that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, so in 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers, right? Because 480, 481, ..., 488 all have 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 numbers instead of 10. So, for the tens place, we have 4 ranges with 10 each and one range with 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, there's no page number where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. Difference: 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I'm wondering if I double-counted somewhere. Let me think about the tens place for 4's. Each range like 40-49 is 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place. Similarly for 140-149, etc. So, 5 ranges, 10 each: 50. That seems correct. For hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct. For 8's, units place: 49, tens place: 49. So, 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a big difference. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position separately, but perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me recount the hundreds place for 4's: from 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Correct. For the tens place, 4's: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 ranges, each 10 numbers: 50. Correct. Units place: every 10 numbers, so 4,14,...,484. How many? From 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of times 4 is in the units digit, which is every 10 numbers. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, and then in the last partial group (481-488), 484 is included, so that's 49. Correct. So, 49 units place 4's. So, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. For 8's: units place: every 10 numbers, 8,18,...,488. So, 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full groups, and 488 is included, so 49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, total 8's: 49+49=98. So, difference: 188-98=90. Hmm, I think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the range 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " To find the total number, I can divide 484 by 10, which gives 48.4, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 484 is 48*10 + 4, so that's 49th occurrence? Wait, no, because starting from 4, every 10 pages. Let me think differently. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's the same as the number of complete groups of 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, in the last partial group (481-488), there's a 484, which is another 4 in the units place. So actually, it's 49 times. Hmm, maybe I should use a formula. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is floor((N + 1)/10) if d \u2260 0, but since 0 is not our case here, maybe it's better to calculate as follows. For units digit, the number of 4's is equal to the number of times 4 appears in the ones place. So, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction, we take 48 full times, but wait, in the 480-488 range, the units digit 4 occurs at 484, so that's one more. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 488 / 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then in the incomplete decade (480-488), there's one more 4 at 484. So total 49. Okay, so units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these decades contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such decades there are. The first is 40-49, which is in the 40s. Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So how many decades? From 0 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, how many hundreds? 488 is 4 hundreds and 88. So, the tens digit cycles 5 times (0-9, 10-19, ..., 480-489). But we only go up to 488. So, for the tens place, the number of 4's is the number of times 4 appears in the tens digit. Each occurrence is 10 numbers, so for each occurrence, it's 10. How many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's list them: 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 4's in tens place. 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So total tens place 4's: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, the number of 4's in the hundreds place is 89. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. So, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me check that again. Units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So total 4's: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. How many times? From 1 to 488, how many multiples of 10 plus 8 are there? The first is 8, then 18, ..., up to 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and in the incomplete decade (480-488), there's 488, which is another 8. So total units place 8's: 48 +1=49. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in decades like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last one is 480-488. So, how many such decades? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so each contributes one 8 in the tens place. So, how many decades? 5 decades, but the last one has only 9 numbers. But regardless, each occurrence in the tens place is 10 numbers, except the last one which is cut short. Wait, no. For the tens place, each occurrence is a full decade except possibly the last one. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-489: but we only go up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is still 8 for all of them. So, in the tens place, each of these decades contributes 10 8's except the last one which contributes 9? Wait, no, because in the tens place, each number from 480-488 has 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 numbers, but each contributes one 8 in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 4 decades (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, plus the 480-488 which contributes 9. So total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Therefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's:188, total 8's:98. Difference:188-98=90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me verify the number of 4's again. Units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. Now for 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades (480 numbers) plus one more 4 at 484. Total: 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in decades like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such decades (including 440-449), each contributing 10 4's. Total: 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Total: 89.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades plus one more 8 at 488. Total: 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in decades like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full decades contributing 10 each, and 480-488 contributes 9. Total: 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place. Total: 0.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " To find how many, I can calculate how many groups of 10 are there up to 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups, meaning 48 times the digit 4 appears in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so in the units place, 484 is the last one. Let me check: 484 is 48*10 + 4, so yes, that's correct. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So 5 * 10 = 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4 in each place: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, the digit 4 appears 187 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence in the units place is 488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, meaning 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so that's correct. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: How many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the first four ranges give 10 each, so 4*10=40, and the last range gives 9. So total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, the digit 8 appears 97 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484), totaling 48 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488), totaling 48 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last range being 480-488 (9 numbers), totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 never appears since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 48 + 49 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 4 to 484, how many numbers are there? Well, the number of terms in this sequence can be found by ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1. Let's calculate that: (480 / 10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within that range, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so only up to 488. Let's see: Each set of ten numbers (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.) contributes 10 4's in the tens place. How many such sets are there? From 0 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in the first 100 pages (1-100), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49). Then, in 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, another 10. 300-399: 340-349, another 10. 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, and then 480-488 would have 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is part of the 400-499 range, but since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit 8 would be in 480-488, but for the tens digit 4, it's only up to 449. Wait, no, 440-449 is 10 numbers, and then 480-488 is another 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488). But wait, in the tens place, when the tens digit is 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. The next set would be 540-549, but that's beyond 488, so we don't count that. So, the number of 4's in the tens place is 5 sets of 10 numbers each? Wait, no, let me correct that. From 0 to 488, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? Each hundred has one set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 1-100: 40-49: 10 numbers. 100-199: 140-149: 10. 200-299: 240-249:10. 300-399:340-349:10. 400-488:440-449:10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5*10=50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But in each of these, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, but wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers are there? The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let's see: Each hundred has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 1-100: 80-89:10 numbers. 100-199:180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers). So, how many 8's in the tens place? 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89 up to 380-389) and then 9 from 480-488. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " To find how many 4's are in the units place, I can calculate how many numbers between 1 and 488 end with 4. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, that means there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does 484 count? Yes, because 484 is less than 488. So, that's 48 times, but wait, 48 times would go up to 480, and then 484 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete decades (1-10, 11-20, etc.) and then 8 more numbers (481-488). So, in each decade, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9, so each decade contributes exactly one 4 in the units place. So, for 48 complete decades (from 1-480), there are 48 4's in the units place. Then, in the last partial decade (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear again in the units place here. So, total 4's in units place: 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the blocks are: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 fit within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This would be from 400-488. Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4. So, how many numbers are there from 400-488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these contributes one 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers between 1 and 488 end with 8? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then in the last partial decade (481-488), the units digit is 8 at 488. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place. The blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last block. Let's count how many full blocks there are. 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's four blocks, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, the next block is 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, only 480-488 are included. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so in the tens place, each of these has an 8 in the tens digit, so that's 9 8's. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 48 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n3. **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488).\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n3. **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " To find how many, I can calculate how many steps of 10 are there between 4 and 484. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, let me check that again. From 4 to 484, inclusive, how many numbers? Well, every 10 numbers, so 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, but since we're dealing with whole numbers, it's 48 full tens, but we start counting from 4, so maybe 49 times? Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think of it as the number of times 4 appears in the units place. For each set of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there up to 488? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That would be 48 times. But wait, in the last block, from 480 to 488, the units digits go from 0 to 8, so 484 is included, which adds another 4. So, 48 blocks give 48 fours, and then the last partial block (480-488) adds one more 4 at 484. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. But wait, since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 440-449, because 450-459 would be beyond 488? Wait, no, 440-449 is within 488, but 450-459 is also within 488, so actually, up to 488, so 440-449 is 10 numbers, 450-459 is another 10, but 460-469, 470-479, 480-488. Wait, but I'm only considering the tens digit. So, for the tens place, 4 can be in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So that's 5 * 10 = 50 fours. Wait, but wait, the last range, 440-449, is within 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. Hmm, but wait, let me think about the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 in the tens place appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, how many eights in the tens place? 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 10 each, so 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 contributes 9 eights in the tens place (since 480,481,...,488: the tens digit is 8 for all these, so 9 numbers). So total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For the 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. Correct. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Number of 4's: \\( \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges.\n   - Number of 4's: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of 4's: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Number of 8's: \\( \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last range contributes 9.\n   - Number of 8's: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:** \\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10, and then 8 extra numbers. Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, the 48th group ends at 480, so the 48th 4 in the units place is at 480. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is within this range, adding one more 4. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but since the book goes up to 488, the last group is 440-449. Let me count how many full decades there are. Each full decade (like 0-99, 100-199, etc.) contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. From 200-299: 240-249 is 10. From 300-399: 340-349 is 10. From 400-488: 440-449 is another 10. So that's 5 groups, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 x 10 = 50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Let's count how many full decades: 0-99: 80-89 is 10. 100-199: 180-189 is 10. 200-299: 280-289 is 10. 300-399: 380-389 is 10. 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each of the first four decades contributes 10, and the last one contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4 x 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times. So, now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the Digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Total occurrences: 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89 times.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188 times.**\n\n**Counting the Digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total occurrences: 0 times.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98 times.**\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90.**\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can calculate how many groups of 10 are there up to 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10. But wait, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, that would be 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so in the 48th group, which is 480-488, the units digit goes from 0 to 8. So, 484 is included, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. Let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has a block where the tens digit is 4. From 1-100: 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 times. Similarly, 101-200: 140-149, another 10. 201-300: 240-249, another 10. 301-400: 340-349, another 10. 401-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers as well. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10. So, in each hundred, 10 times. How many hundreds are there? From 1-400, that's four hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Then 401-488 is another partial hundred. But in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 hundreds in total, each contributing 10 occurrences. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so the last block is 401-488, but the tens digit 4 occurs only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 5 blocks, each with 10, so 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place? Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for each number from 400 to 488. So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check: from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. So, adding up all the places: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98 + 89 = 187. So, total number of 4's is 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so in the 48th group, which is 480-488, the units digit 8 occurs at 488, so that's the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 block, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. So, each block of 100 has a block where the tens digit is 8, except the last block, which might be partial. Let me count: From 1-100: 80-89, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 times. 101-200: 180-189, another 10. 201-300: 280-289, another 10. 301-400: 380-389, another 10. 401-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, because 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so it's 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times in the 401-488 range. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (from 1-400) plus 9 in the last block. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's: 187. Total 8's: 97. Difference: 187 - 97 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, for the 4's: units place: 48 times. Tens place: 50 times. Hundreds place: 89 times. Total: 48 + 50 = 98 + 89 = 187. That seems correct. For the 8's: units place: 48 times. Tens place: 49 times. Hundreds place: 0. Total: 48 + 49 = 97. So, 187 - 97 = 90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check that again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 occurrences. That seems correct. For the tens place of 4's: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. That seems right. Units place: every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 times. So, 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. For 8's: units place: 48 times. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, total 8's: 48 + 49 = 97. So, the difference is indeed 187 - 97 = 90. Wait, but let me think again. When counting the units place for 4's, I considered 488 as the last page, so 484 is included, which is correct. Similarly, for 8's, the units place goes up to 488, so 488 is included, which is correct. For the tens place of 8's, in the last block, 480-488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 occurrences. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. That's correct. So, I think my calculations are accurate, and the difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block contributes 10, with 5 such blocks totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).

    "text": " The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. To find how many terms are in this sequence, I can subtract 4 from 484, which gives 480, then divide by 10 to get 48. Then add 1 because both endpoints are included. So that's 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, let me check that again. The formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Yes, that's correct. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count each block. - 40-49: That's 10 numbers, so 10 times. - 140-149: Another 10. - 240-249: 10 again. - 340-349: 10. - 440-449: 10. Now, wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So that's 5 blocks of 10, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, does 440-449 include numbers up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. That's from 400 up to 488. Let's see how many numbers that is. 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, then 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit position. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many terms. The first is 8, last is 488. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let me check each block. - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: Hmm, this one is a bit different because 488 is the last page. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 times. So, the first four blocks are 10 each, and the last one is 9. So total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.

Let me check: from 4 to 484, that's 49 numbers where 4 is in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where 4 is in the tens place. How many such ranges are there? Let's see: starting from 40-49 (which is the first set), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So that's 5 sets of 10 numbers each. So 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, that's fine. So 50 times for the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last occurrence in the units place is 488. So, how many times? Using the same formula: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = (480 / 10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let me check each range: - 80-89: that's 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: that's 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total in the tens place is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, let me double-check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10*4 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, does 8 appear in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, since the book has 488 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For the 4's: Units place: 4,14,...,484. So, from 4 to 484, step 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 =49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct. For the 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10. Number of terms: ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 ranges, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0, as 800+ is beyond 488. So total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Wait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. But when counting digits, each of those 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89. Correct. So, 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. For 8's, units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can calculate how many sets of 10 there are up to 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is 484 = 48*10 + 4. So, that's 48 times. Wait, but 488 is 488, so 488 is 48*10 + 8, so the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in each set of 10, the units digit is 4 exactly once. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? It's 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, the 488th page is 488, so the 48th set ends at 480, and then we have 481 to 488. In those 8 numbers, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so no 4 in the units place beyond 480. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there? Let's see: The first is 40-49, which is the first set. Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 sets * 10 = 50 times. But wait, let me check: 40-49: 10 numbers, tens digit 4. 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So, that's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times. Wait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, yes, 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 times. Now, adding up the number of 4's: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so the last 8 in the units place is at 488. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many complete sets of 10 are there? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, total in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, let me check: 80-89: 10. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the number of 8's: units place (48) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 48+49=97. So, 97 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, let me confirm the calculations: 187 - 97. 187 - 90=97, then -7 more is 90. Yes, that's correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times (from 4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times (from 8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times (including 480-488).\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 48 + 49 = 97\n\n**Difference:** 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Let me check. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Well, every 10 numbers, there's exactly one number ending with 4. So, from 1 to 488, how many groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups and then 8 extra numbers. So, in each group, there's one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, in the 480-488 range, the 484 is included, so that's one more. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, that makes sense. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Let's see how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-100: 40-49, that's 10 numbers. From 101-200: 140-149, another 10. From 201-300: 240-249, another 10. From 301-400: 340-349, another 10. Now, from 401-488: 440-449 is another 10, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 fall entirely within 401-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, total tens place 4's: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's do the same for 8's. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? First occurrence is 8, last is 488. Using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place 8's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is within 401-488, so let's check each block. From 1-100: 80-89, 10 numbers. From 101-200: 180-189, another 10. From 201-300: 280-289, another 10. From 301-400: 380-389, another 10. From 401-488: 480-488. Now, how many numbers are there from 480-488? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers (480-488). So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (from 1-400) and then 9 in 401-488. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. For the tens place, in the 400-488 range, the 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. Wait, but when I was counting the tens place for 8's, I included 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but does that affect the count? Let me make sure. Yes, because in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's correct. So, the total 4's are 188, 8's are 98, so the difference is 90.

Let me check: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 would go up to 449, which is within 488. So, each of these decades has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such decades there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. So that's 5 decades, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so it's valid. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 only in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, 400-488 is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But wait, I'm only counting the hundreds digit, which is 4 for all these numbers. So, that's 89 times. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the digit 8, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in decades like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place being 8. So, each of these decades contributes 10 numbers, except maybe the last one. Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488)\n\nSo, total in the tens place: 4 decades with 10 each, and 1 with 9. So, 4*10 +9=40+9=49.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nWait, so 4's are 188 and 8's are 98. The difference would be 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each part again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, step 10. The number of terms is ((484-4)/10)+1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each is 10 numbers. How many such decades? From 40-49 is first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 decades, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds: 400-488. How many numbers? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 times. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10. Number of terms: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four decades has 10 numbers, the last one has 9 (since 488 is the end). So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds: None, since 800-899 is beyond 488. So, 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly for the tens place of 8's. Specifically, 480-488: how many numbers? From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488). So, 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, 440-449: that's 10 numbers, since 440 to 449 is 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so it's valid.\n\nI think I did this correctly. So, the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAnd for the 8's, in the hundreds place, there are none. So, 0.\n\nSo, the counts seem accurate. Therefore, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in decades 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each decade contributes 10 numbers, totaling 5 decades: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in decades 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four decades contribute 10 each, last decade contributes 9: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are from 1 to 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the 48th group ends at 480, and then we have 481-488. So, from 1-480, there are 48 4's in the units place, and then in 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so no additional 4's in the units place. So, total 4's in units place: 48. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's. So, 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, I need to check if 440-449 is entirely within the book's pages. Since the book ends at 488, 440-449 is fine. So, total 4's in the tens place: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. So, total 4's in hundreds place: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total number of 4's printed is 187. Now, I need to do the same for 8's. Let me go through each digit position again. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many 8's in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is the last page, so in the last group (481-490), but since we only go up to 488, the units digits go up to 8. So, the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many 8's in the units place? From 1-480, it's 48 8's, and then from 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so that's one more 8 (488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but let me check. If I take 488 divided by 10, it's 48.8, which means 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, and then in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so that's one more 8. So, total 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-489 would only go up to 488. So, how many ranges are there? 80-89 is one, 180-189 is another, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except the last one, which is only 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, 480-489 is 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 80-89: 10 8's, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 (since 480,481,...488 is 9 numbers). So, total 8's in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800-899, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, there are 0 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that's 98 8's. But let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so total 98. Now, the number of 4's was 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, but that seems high. Let me double-check my counts.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the 4's. Let me recount the 4's.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, so 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in units place. But wait, 488 is included, so does that add an extra? Let me see: 4,14,...,484. The last one is 484, which is 48th occurrence. So, units place: 48.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range contributes 10 4's. So, that's 5 ranges, 5x10=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 +50 +89= 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: From 8,18,...,488. 488 is included, so how many? 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and then 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each of the first four ranges contributes 10 8's, and the last range, 480-488, contributes 9 8's (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, as before.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 +49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 -98=89.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check again. The ranges are:\n\n80-89: 10 numbers, each with 8 in tens place.\n\n180-189:10\n\n280-289:10\n\n380-389:10\n\n480-488:9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, from 480 to 488 inclusive).\n\nSo, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in tens place, 40-49,140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 ranges, each with 10 4's, so 50.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 187-98=89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, it's easy to miscount. Let me try another approach for 8's in the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in the ranges where the tens digit is 8. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers. So, from 1-400, how many hundreds do we have? 4 hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Wait, but 400 is included in the hundreds place. Wait, no, 400 is the start of the hundreds digit being 4. So, up to 399, we have 4 hundreds. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers, so 4 hundreds x10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total 40 +9=49. That matches my earlier count. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for units digit of 8: in each hundred, there are 10 numbers with units digit 8, so 4 hundreds x10=40, and then in 400-488, the units digit 8 occurs once more at 488, so total 40 +1=41. Wait, wait, this contradicts my earlier count. Earlier, I thought units digit of 8 occurs 49 times. Now, this approach says 41. Hmm, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, no, because 488 is the 49th occurrence. Let me see: from 1-400, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Each hundred has 10, so 4x10=40. Then, from 401-488, the units digit 8 occurs once at 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. Wait, that's 9 times. So, total units digit 8's:40 +9=49. So, that's correct. So, earlier approach was correct.\n\nSo, going back, units digit 8's:49, tens digit 8's:49, hundreds digit 8's:0. Total 8's:98.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's, we have 187.\n\nSo, the difference is 187-98=89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the initial problem, the book has 488 pages, so page 488 is included. So, in the tens place for 8's, 480-488 is 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, in units place, 488 is included, so that's one more 8.\n\nSo, I think my counts are correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 187, the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 89.\n\nWait, but let me check once more.\n\nWait, another way to count 4's:\n\n- Units place: For each page from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in units place? It's floor(488/10)=48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, and then in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), 4 doesn't appear in units place. So, 48.\n\n- Tens place: For each page, how many times does 4 appear in tens place? It's the number of complete groups of 100, which is 4 (since 488/100=4.88), each contributing 10 4's in tens place, so 4x10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles again. The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 40 +10=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's:48 +50 +89=187.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\n- Units place: floor(488/10)=48, plus 1 if 488 is included, which it is, so 49.\n\n- Tens place: floor(488/100)=4, each contributing 10 8's, so 4x10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total 40 +9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 187-98=89.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can calculate how many groups of 10 there are in 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're dealing with whole numbers, there are 48 complete groups of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, the last group is 481-488, which includes 484, so that's an extra 4 in the units place. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. Each full decade (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, there are 48 decades, each contributing one 4, so that's 48. Then from 481 to 488, the units place 4 is at 484, so that's one more. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, let me check. From 1-488, the tens place 4 occurs in 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each with 10, so 50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, each number from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48. But wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, it's the last page. So, from 1-488, the units place 8 occurs 49 times? Wait, no. Because 488 is included, so let's check: the first 8 is at 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms are there in this sequence? The nth term is 8 + 10(n-1). Let's set that equal to 488: 8 + 10(n-1) = 488 \u2192 10(n-1) = 480 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n=49. So, there are 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such blocks are within 488. The blocks are 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). The next block would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, only 480-488 are included. So, does that count as a full block? No, because it's only 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many 8's in the tens place? Each full block contributes 10 8's, and the partial block (480-488) contributes 9 8's (since 480-488 has 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, but in the tens place, 480-488: the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, right? Because 480 is 4 8 0, 481 is 4 8 1, etc., up to 488. So, that's 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, total blocks: 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, so 4x10=40. Plus the partial block 480-488 contributing 9. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).

    "text": " To find how many, I can use the formula: ((last occurrence - first occurrence) / interval) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that seems high. Let me check: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Well, every 10 numbers, there's one. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full tens, so 48 times, but wait, 488 is the 48th ten? Hmm, maybe I should think differently. Let's consider that the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, that's 48 times. But wait, the last group is 481-490, but our book stops at 488, so the units digit 4 appears in 484, which is within the 480-489 range, but since we stop at 488, does that affect the count? Hmm, 484 is within 480-488, so yes, that's included. So, the units place has 48 occurrences of 4. Wait, but earlier I thought it might be 49. Let me double-check. Let me count how many numbers between 1 and 488 end with 4. The first is 4, then 14, 24, ..., up to 484. The number of terms in this sequence is given by (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, it's 49 times. So, I think my initial calculation was correct with 49. Maybe I was confused earlier. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This occurs in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, the tens place has 50 occurrences of 4. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This occurs in the range 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds place has 89 occurrences of 4. Now, adding up all the places: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the units digit is 8. The numbers are 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This occurs in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But our book ends at 488, so the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, how many ranges? From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers). So, that's 4 ranges with 10 each and 1 range with 9. So, total is 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. This occurs in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up all the places: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For the 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems right. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are up to 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups. But wait, each group has exactly one 4 in the units place. So that would be 48 times. But wait, the last group is 480-488, which includes 484, so that's correct. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many ranges is that? Let's see: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 48 times. Wait, but 488 is included, so that's correct. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me count these ranges. From 0-99: 80-89 is one range. From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. Now, from 400-488: The next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the range is 480-488. So, that's a partial range. Each full range (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 numbers, so 4 full ranges \u00d710=40. But the 480-488 range is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, total in tens place is 4 full ranges \u00d710=40, plus 9 from the partial range. So, 40 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10. That's 4\u00d710=40. Then 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 40+9=49. Correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the hundreds place with 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, 97 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 48 occurrences (4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, giving 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 48 occurrences (8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with an additional 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 48 + 49 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives me 48 full groups of 10, and then check the remainder. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so that means 48 complete groups where 4 appears once each in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last group goes up to 488, but 488 is in the hundreds place. So, does 484 fall within 488? Yes, because 484 is less than 488. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 times. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra in the last partial decade. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, in each of the 48 complete decades, 4 appears once in the units place. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, 484 is the only one where 4 is in the units place in this last partial decade. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer division gives 48, and the remainder is 8. So, in the units place, each complete decade contributes one 4, and in the remaining 8 numbers, we check if any have 4 in the units place. Since 484 is within 481-488, that's one more. So, total 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, counting the number of times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, in 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, in 140-149, 240-249, etc. So, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Let's see: The first group is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and then 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's another group. Let me count how many groups: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 groups, each contributing 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 5 groups, each with 10 4's in the tens place, so 50. But wait, is that correct? Let me check. From 0-99: 40-49: 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149: 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249: 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349: 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449: 10 numbers. So, yes, 5 groups, each contributing 10, so 50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. So, 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, okay, maybe that's correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** How many times does 8 appear in the units place? Similar to the 4's, it's every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, in each of the 48 complete decades, 8 appears once in the units place. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), does 8 appear in the units place? Let's see: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. The last number is 488, which has 8 in the units place. So, in the last partial decade, 8 appears once. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, counting 8's in the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last group is 480-488. So, how many such groups? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, for the first four groups, each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, and the last group contributes 9. So, total 8's in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check. 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in tens place. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, each of these numbers has 8 in the tens place, so 9 times. So, total 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, number of 8's in hundreds place: 0. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total 188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total 98. Difference: 188-98=90. Hmm, okay, maybe that's correct. But let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. For the tens place, 4's: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 groups, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Units place: 49. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49. So, 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. Wait, but let me think again about the units place for 4's. When I calculated units place for 4's, I had 488 divided by 10 is 48 with remainder 8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 in units place, and then in the last 8 numbers, 481-488, 484 is the only one with 4 in units place, so 48+1=49. That seems correct. Similarly for 8's, units place: same calculation, 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in units place, and in the last 8 numbers, 488 is the only one with 8 in units place, so 48+1=49. That's correct. For tens place, 4's: 5 groups, each 10, so 50. 8's: 4 full groups (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49. That's correct. Hundreds place: 4's have 89, 8's have 0. So, yes, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers.

Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence, right? Because 484 = 4 + (48-1)*10. Let me check: 4 + 10*47 = 4 + 470 = 474, which is the 48th number. So, 48 times. But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4. So, units place has 48 4's.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449, but since the book ends at 488, the last set would be 440-449. Let me figure out how many such sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, and the tens digit is 4. The first set is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, 140-149, another 10, and so on. How many such sets are there? The hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. But since page numbers start at 1, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 1-99), 1, 2, 3, or 4. But when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can only go up to 8 because the book ends at 488. Wait, no, the tens digit can be 4 even when the hundreds digit is 4, but only up to page 488. So, let's think differently. For the tens place, the 4 can appear in the tens position for each hundred. So, from 0-99, 40-49: 10 numbers. From 100-199, 140-149: 10 numbers. From 200-299, 240-249: 10 numbers. From 300-399, 340-349: 10 numbers. From 400-488, 440-449: 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5*10=50. Wait, but let me check: 40-49: 10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, so 50 4's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488. So, n-1 \u2264 (488-8)/10 = 480/10=48. So, n=49. So, 49 8's in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-489 would be another set, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. Let's break it down:\n\n- From 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers.\n- From 100-199: 180-189:10 numbers.\n- From 200-299:280-289:10 numbers.\n- From 300-399:380-389:10 numbers.\n- From 400-488:480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page).\n\nSo, adding these up: 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's here.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because when I counted 4's, I got 187, and 8's are 98. So, the difference would be 187-98=89. But wait, let me double-check my counting for 8's because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, in the tens place, I had 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. And in the units place, I had 49. So, total 8's are 49+49=98. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 187-98=89.\n\nWait, but let me check again to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 48 (from 4,14,...,484)\n- Tens: 50 (from 40-49,140-149, etc., 5 sets)\n- Hundreds: 89 (from 400-488)\nTotal: 48+50=98, 98+89=187.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49 (from 8,18,...,488)\n- Tens: 49 (from 80-89,180-189, etc., 5 sets of 10 except the last one which is 9)\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, 187-98=89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of '4's:**\n   - **Units Place:** '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 48 such numbers.\n   - **Tens Place:** '4' appears in the tens place in sets like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** '4' appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total '4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the number of '8's:**\n   - **Units Place:** '8' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens Place:** '8' appears in the tens place in sets like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers with '8' in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of '8's from the total number of '4's: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " To find how many, I can divide 484 by 10, which gives 48.4, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, I take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, let me check: from 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place, 4 can appear in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the hundreds go up to 4. So, the blocks are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. Wait, but 401-488 is only 88 numbers, not a full 100. So, in the tens place, in each full hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.), there are 10 4's in the tens place. Let's see: 40-49 is 10 numbers, then 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 is another 10, 340-349 is another 10, and 440-449 is another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does the last block (440-449) fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, the number of 8's in the units place is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. 8 can appear in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the hundreds go up to 4. So, the blocks are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. Now, in each full hundred block, 80-89 is 10 numbers, then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89 is in 1-100, so that's one block. Then 180-189 in 101-200, another block. 280-289 in 201-300, another. 380-389 in 301-400, another. Now, in 401-488, does 480-489 exist? Well, 480-489 would be within 488, so 480-488 is part of that. But wait, 480-489 is a block of 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, we only have 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 480-488 has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, for the tens place, in 401-488, we have 9 occurrences instead of 10. So, total in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. Wait, no. Let me clarify: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 full blocks of 10 and one partial block of 9. So, total in the tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The digit 8 can only appear in the hundreds place if the page number is 800 or above. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, there are 0 occurrences of 8 in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, the number of 4's is 188 and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 5 * 10 = 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Full blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives me 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each with one 4 in the units place. However, the 48th group ends at 480, and then we have 481 to 488. So, in the units place, from 1 to 488, 4 appears once every 10 numbers, so 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page. Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full cycles of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. The first is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, each subsequent hundred has another 10 numbers: 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? So, how many hundreds are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, that's five sets. Each set except the last one has a full 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. The last set, 400-488, includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Wait, no. Wait, 400-488: the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, the total number of times 4 appears in the tens place is 5 times 10, which is 50. Wait, let me check: 40-49: 10 numbers, tens digit 4. 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50 times. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4. So, that's 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Wait, but I'm only counting the digit 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, I need to count how many times 8 appears. Let me do the same for 8: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let me divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. So, there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 48\u00d710=480, so the last group is 481-490, but the book ends at 488, so the last occurrence of 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many times? From 8,18,...,488. Let me see: the first is 8, then 18, 28,...,488. How many terms? The nth term can be represented as 8 + (n-1)\u00d710. The last term is 488. So, 8 + (n-1)\u00d710=488 \u2192 (n-1)\u00d710=480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 times. Wait, that's different from the 48 I thought earlier. Let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. The first term is 8 (n=1), then 18 (n=2), ..., 488 is 8 + 48\u00d710=488. So, n=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 can appear in the tens place. So, for example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199:180-189 (10). From 200-299:280-289 (10). From 300-399:380-389 (10). From 400-488: does 480-489 fall within 488? 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. Wait, so in the hundreds place of 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place, we have 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 full hundreds with 10 each, and the last partial hundred with 9. So, total for tens place: 4\u00d710 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. So, 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds =49+49+0=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 187, number of 8's is 98. So, 187-98=89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89, total=187. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0, total=98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, that's correct. Wait, but let me check the units place for 4. Earlier, I thought 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 times. But when I calculated for 8, I got 49 times. That's because 488 is included, so 488 is the 49th occurrence. Similarly, for 4 in the units place, does 488 include a 4 in the units place? No, because 488 ends with 8. So, the last occurrence of 4 in the units place would be 484, which is 48th occurrence. So, 48 times for 4 in units. For 8 in units, it's 49 times because 488 is included. So, that seems correct. Similarly, for 4 in tens place: 40-49, 140-149,...,440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times. For 8 in tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last one is only 9 numbers, so total 49. So, yes, 49 times. So, 4's total 187, 8's total 98. Difference is 89. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).

To find how many terms are in this sequence, I can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1.

So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can also appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.

But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so it's okay. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The page numbers go up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, when the hundreds digit is 4, the page numbers are from 400-488. How many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 occurrences. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them all up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first term is 8, the last term is 488. Using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8's in the tens place occur in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is valid. Let me count how many full sets and partial sets there are. Each hundred block (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers where 8 is in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the hundreds digits go up to 4, so we have 80-89 (hundreds digit 0), 180-189 (hundreds digit 1), 280-289 (hundreds digit 2), 380-389 (hundreds digit 3), and 480-488 (hundreds digit 4). So that's 5 sets. Each set contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except the last one, which is only 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, the last set has 9 numbers. So, the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 8's, and the last set (480-488) contributes 9 8's. So total 8's in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit being 8. But the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the maximum is 4.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " To find the count, I can use the formula: ((last occurrence - first occurrence) / interval) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that seems too high. Let me check: from 4 to 484, how many steps of 10 are there? 484 is the 49th term because 484 = 4 + (480). So, 480 divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. Hmm, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range. So, yes, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences. Let's see how many full ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. Similarly, 240-249 and 340-349 each add 10. Now, 440-449 would be another 10, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within that. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, but does 449 exist? Since 488 is the last page, 449 is fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. So, pages 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place for 8. Let me calculate each range. From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is another 10. From 200-299: 280-289 is 10. From 300-399: 380-389 is 10. From 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, adding these up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences (since pages go up to 488).\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " To find how many, I can calculate how many groups of 10 are there up to 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups, but since 484 is the last one in the units place, that's 48 times. Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence because starting from 4, each 10 pages adds one more 4. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, let's see how many such ranges exist. From 0-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, which is 10 numbers, then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's valid. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times. The last occurrence in the units place is 488. So, how many groups of 10 are there up to 488? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, meaning 48 times in the units place. Wait, but 488 is included, so that's actually 49 times? Wait, no. Because 8, 18, ..., 488. Let's see: starting at 8, each step is +10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is within the book's pages. Since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is included. So, how many such ranges are there? 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, let's count each: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total in tens place is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units place up to 484 is 48 times. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 ranges, 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, 48+50+89=187. For 8's: units place is 49 times, tens place is 49 times, hundreds place 0. So, 49+49=98. 187-98=89. So, 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, ..., 484 \u2192 48 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear \u2192 0 times.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"
