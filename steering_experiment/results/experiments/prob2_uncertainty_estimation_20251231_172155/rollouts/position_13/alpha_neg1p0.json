    "text": " The number of terms in this sequence can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but let me check: from 4 to 484, each 10 pages add one 4 in the units place. So, 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 is 48*10 + 4. So, 48 times. But wait, does 484 count as the 48th? Let me see: 4 is the first, 14 the second, ..., 484 would be the (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49th occurrence. Hmm, so maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me think again. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, the last group ends at 480, so from 481 to 488, the units digit doesn't reach another 4. So, actually, the number of 4's in the units place is 48. But wait, let me confirm with an example: from 1 to 10, 4 appears once (at 4). From 1 to 20, twice (4 and 14). So, yes, for every 10 pages, one 4 in the units place. So, total 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these decades contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such decades are there up to 488? Let's see: The first is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 decades. Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5*10=50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 decades, each with 10 4's in the tens place: 50. But wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me think again. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in the range 1-100, 40-49 is one decade, contributing 10 4's. Similarly, 140-149 is another, and so on up to 440-449. So, how many such decades are there in 488? Let's see: 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. In each of the first four hundreds, there's one decade where the tens digit is 4. So, 4 decades, each contributing 10 4's: 4*10=40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total 5 decades, each with 10 4's in the tens place: 5*10=50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens in the range 400-488. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. So, total 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98; 98+89=187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. The first occurrence is at 8, then 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence in the units place is at 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. Wait, but let me confirm: 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8 in the tens place. So, let's see how many such decades we have. From 1-488, the decades where the tens digit is 8 are: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four decades (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 8's in the tens place. The last one, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480-488), so 9 8's in the tens place. So, total in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. Wait, but let me think again. Each decade from 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the last decade is only up to 488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's: 187, total 8's: 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit):** The digit 4 appears every 10 pages (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 48 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit):** The digit 4 appears in decades like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit):** The digit 4 appears in page numbers 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit):** The digit 8 appears every 10 pages (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit):** The digit 8 appears in decades like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit):** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 89 more times than the digit 8.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " The total number of terms can be calculated by dividing 484 by 10 and adding 1. Wait, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, but since we can't have a fraction of a term, we take the integer part, which is 48, and then add 1 because we start counting from 0. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but let me check that again. If the last page is 488, the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is correct. So from 4 to 484, that's every 10 numbers. So, the number of 4's in the units place is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 480-489 would be beyond 488. So, let's see: How many sets of 100 are there? From 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, in each hundred, the tens place has a 4 for 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many complete hundreds are there? Up to 400-488, so that's 4 hundreds (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, actually, 400-488 is part of the 400-499 range, but since we only go up to 488, the last set is 440-449 and 480-488. Wait, no, 440-449 is a full set, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers because 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9). Wait, no, let me count: 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers. So, how many full sets of 10 numbers in the tens place? Let me think differently. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49 in the first hundred). So, how many hundreds are there? From 1-488, that's 4 hundreds: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, actually, 400-488 is part of the 400-499 hundred, but it's not complete. So, in each of the first four hundreds (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers each. So that's 4 sets \u00d710=40. Now, in the last partial hundred, 400-488, how many times does the tens digit 4 occur? The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but 480-488 is actually 480,481,...,488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449 (10 numbers) and 480-488 (9 numbers). So, that's 10 + 9 = 19 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, and 480-488 is 9, so total 19. But wait, is that correct? Let me check: 440-449 is 10 numbers, and 480-488 is 9 numbers, so yes, 19. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 a total of 19 times. So, adding that to the previous 40, we get 40 +19=59. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because 400-488 is part of the 400-499 hundred, but we're only going up to 488. Wait, perhaps I should think of it as the 400-488 range. So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449 and 480-488. So, that's 10 +9=19. So, total tens digit 4's: 4 sets \u00d710=40, plus 19=59. Wait, but let me check: 1-99: 40-49: 10 numbers. 100-199: 140-149:10. 200-299:240-249:10. 300-399:340-349:10. 400-488:440-449:10, 480-488:9. So, total is 10\u00d74 +10 +9=40+19=59. So, 59 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 -400 +1=89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. So, total 4's in hundreds place:89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (59) + hundreds (89)=49+59=108, 108+89=197. So, total 4's:197. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 -8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count these. a. 80-89:10 numbers. b. 180-189:10. c.280-289:10. d.380-389:10. e.480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers). So, total tens place 8's:10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's:0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. So, total 4's:197, total 8's:98. Now, the difference is 197 -98=99. Wait, that can't be right because 197-98=99, but let me double-check my calculations. Let me recount the 4's and 8's to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=59, hundreds=89. Total=49+59=108, 108+89=197. That seems correct. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. So, 197-98=99. So, there are 99 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because in the tens place for 8's, I included 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49, which is correct. Similarly, for 4's in the tens place, in 400-488, it's 440-449 (10) and 480-488 (9), but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but in the tens place, 480-488 would have 8's in the tens place, not 4's. Wait, no, in the tens place, 480-488 would have 8 in the tens place, so 4's in the tens place in 400-488 are only 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 19, but that was a mistake. Wait, let me correct that. When I was counting 4's in the tens place, I mistakenly included 480-488 as 4's in the tens place, but actually, 480-488 have 8 in the tens place, not 4. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate the 4's in the tens place. So, for each hundred: 1-99:40-49:10. 100-199:140-149:10. 200-299:240-249:10. 300-399:340-349:10. 400-488:440-449:10. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5\u00d710=50. So, 4's in the tens place:50. Earlier, I thought it was 59, but that was incorrect because I mistakenly included 480-488, which are 8's, not 4's. So, correcting that, 4's in the tens place:50. Therefore, total 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. So, 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's:188. Now, for 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. So, difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure. Let me recount the 4's in the tens place. From 1-99:40-49:10. 100-199:140-149:10. 200-299:240-249:10. 300-399:340-349:10. 400-488:440-449:10. That's 5 sets, 10 each:50. So, yes, 50. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. 8's:49+49=98. Difference:188-98=90. So, the correct answer should be 90. I think I made a mistake earlier by including 480-488 in the 4's tens place, which is incorrect because those are 8's. So, the correct difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 hundreds considered (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n   - However, in the 400-488 range, only 440-449 contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Total: 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:**\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\n- Total: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences, except the last set which contributes 9.\n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:**\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\n- Total: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's: 188\n- Number of 8's: 98\n- Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " The total number of 4's in the units place is the number of terms in this sequence. The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term a1 = 4, the common difference d = 10, and the last term an = 484. To find the number of terms n, we can use the formula: an = a1 + (n - 1)d. So, 484 = 4 + (n - 1)*10. Subtract 4 from both sides: 480 = (n - 1)*10. Divide both sides by 10: 48 = n - 1. So, n = 49. Wait, that seems high. Let me check: 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so there are 49 terms because we include both the first and last terms. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me count how many times 4 appears in each of these ranges. - 40-49: There are 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. So, 10 times. - 140-149: Similarly, 10 numbers, 10 times. - 240-249: 10 times. - 340-349: 10 times. - 440-449: Now, wait, the book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within the range. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 5*10=50 times. But wait, let me make sure. 40-49 is 10, then 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10. So yes, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, I need to count the number of 8's. Let's do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. Let me count how many terms there are. The first term is 8, the last term is 488. Using the same arithmetic sequence formula: an = a1 + (n - 1)d. So, 488 = 8 + (n - 1)*10. Subtract 8: 480 = (n - 1)*10. Divide by 10: 48 = n - 1. So, n = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's check each range. - 80-89: 10 numbers, 10 times. - 180-189: 10 times. - 280-289: 10 times. - 380-389: 10 times. - 480-488: Here, the tens digit is 8 for numbers 480 to 488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 9 times. So, adding up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (4, 14, ..., 484)\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449)\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488)\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (8, 18, ..., 488)\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488)\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " To find the total number, I can use the formula: (Last - First) / Interval + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 484 is the last one, right? Let me check: 484 is 480 + 4, so yes, that's correct. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many sets of ten there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10. Wait, but 440-449: the last page is 488, so 449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, I think I made a mistake here. Because when the tens digit is 4, it's not just the first occurrence. Let me think again. For the tens place, the 4 can be in the tens digit for each hundred. So, in the first hundred (1-100), the 4's in the tens place are 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in the second hundred (101-200), it's 140-149, another 10. Third hundred (201-300): 240-249, 10. Fourth hundred (301-400): 340-349, 10. Fifth hundred (401-500): but wait, our book only goes up to 488, so in the 400s, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets of 10, so 50 in total. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, but we're only concerned with the hundreds digit being 4. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. But each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but let me check: 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. Using the same formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is the last set. Let's count each set. - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: this is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total is 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct. I think I did everything right.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. To find the number of terms, I can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence. The nth term is given by a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, where a_1 is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms. Here, a_1 = 4, d = 10, and a_n = 484. So, 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 4 from both sides: 480 = (n-1)*10. Divide both sides by 10: 48 = n - 1. So, n = 49. That means there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, but let me check that because 484 is the last one, and 484 is 484, so from 4 to 484, how many steps of 10? Let me think differently. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Yes, that's correct. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. Wait, does 440-449 fall within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's another range. So that's 5 ranges in total. Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5 ranges * 10 = 50 occurrences. Wait, but wait a second. Let me check that. From 1-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. From 200-299: 240-249 is 10. From 300-399: 340-349 is 10. From 400-488: 440-449 is 10. So that's 5*10=50. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. Each page number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? The first number is 400, and the last is 488. So, the count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Wait, that's because from 400 to 488 inclusive, it's 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. So, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 occurrences of the digit 4. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many terms there are. The first term is 8, the last term is 488. Using the same arithmetic sequence formula: a_n = 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, 8 + 10(n-1) = 488. Subtract 8: 10(n-1) = 480. Divide by 10: n-1 = 48. So, n = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. Wait, but let me check: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, how many terms? ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 can appear in the tens place. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences in the tens place, except possibly the last one if it doesn't complete the full 10 numbers. Let's check each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: Here, the tens digit is 8, but the units digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, in the tens place, that's 9 occurrences of 8. Therefore, total in the tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but wait: let me think again. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, contributing 10 each. The last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 8 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 800-899, but wait, our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit can never be 8 because the highest page is 488. So, there are zero occurrences of 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, total occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 188. For 8's: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. Yes. And for 8's, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 49 in tens. Units place is 49. So, 98 total. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the hundreds place for 4's would contribute more, but maybe that's correct. Let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, counting 4's:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, step 10. Number of terms: ((484 -4)/10)+1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488. 488-400+1=89. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units place:8,18,...,488. ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, last has 9. So 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488. So 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four ranges have 10 each, and the last has 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** None, as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

To find the number of terms, I can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: number of terms = ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. Here, the common difference is 10. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for numbers from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's one range. Then, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's a total of 5 ranges. Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, I should check if the last range, 440-449, is within the 488-page limit. Since 449 is less than 488, yes, it's included. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. Wait, but in the hundreds place, the 4 is fixed, so any number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? The first number is 400, and the last is 488. So, the count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many terms there are. The first term is 8, the last term is 488. Using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place for numbers 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488, which is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Let me count the ranges: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9. So yes, 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but since the book only has 488 pages, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.

To find how many terms are in this sequence, I can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: last term = first term + (n - 1) * common difference. Here, the common difference is 10.

So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4.

So, 5 * 10 = 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is fully included. Since 449 is less than 488, yes, it is included. So, 50 occurrences. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 here. How many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, there are 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. Let's find how many terms: 488 = 8 + (n - 1)*10 \u2192 488 - 8 = (n - 1)*10 \u2192 480 = (n - 1)*10 \u2192 n - 1 = 48 \u2192 n = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. So, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 4 * 10 = 40 occurrences. Wait, but let me check if 380-389 is fully included. 389 is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So, 40 occurrences. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, 8 appears 89 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (number of 4's) - 89 (number of 8's) = 99. So, there are 99 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This sequence has 49 terms.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 numbers, totaling 40 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 40 = 89.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 89 (number of 8's) = 99.\n\n\\boxed{99}"

Wait, but wait, 488 is the last page, so the last units place 4 would be at 484, which is correct. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 appears in the tens place for numbers from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, the last page is 488, so 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? The first number is 400, and the last is 488. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 times. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Let me check how many numbers that is. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: that's 9 numbers because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers (since 488-480+1=9). So, total in tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and one range of 9, so 4*10 +9=49. Wait, let me confirm. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only for numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when I was calculating the tens place for 8's, I thought of 480-488 as 9 numbers. Let me check that again. 480 is the first, then 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers, right? So, 480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers. So, that part is correct. So, the total 8's are 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The 4 appears in the units place at 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The 4 appears in the tens place for numbers 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The 8 appears in the units place at 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four ranges contributes 10 numbers, and the last range contributes 9 numbers.\n   - Total: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of terms: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Wait, but does 484 fall within the page numbers? Yes, since the book has 488 pages, 484 is a valid page number. So, that's 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. From 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 488 pages? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. How many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me check again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 numbers where the hundreds digit is 4. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's printed are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many terms. ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the valid range for the hundreds place. Let me correct that. So, for the tens place, the ranges are: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is 9 numbers (from 480 to 488 inclusive). So, for the tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me check again. Each range where the tens digit is 8 is 10 numbers, except possibly the last one if it's cut off. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, yes, 49 in total. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.

Wait, but the last page is 488, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is correct because 488 is 488, so the next 4 would be at 494, which is beyond 488. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 440-449, because 450-488 would have 4 in the hundreds place, but in the tens place, it's 4 only up to 449. Let me count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-100: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. From 101-200: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. From 201-300: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. From 301-400: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. From 401-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is okay because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 sets of 10, so 5*10 = 50 occurrences. Wait, but let me check: 40-49: 10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So yes, 5 sets, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. Setting that equal to 488: 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488 \u21d2 (n-1)*10 = 480 \u21d2 n-1 = 48 \u21d2 n=49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so let's check. From 1-100: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. From 101-200: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. From 201-300: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. From 301-400: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. From 401-488: 480-489. But wait, the last page is 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the hundreds place for 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens place 8's are: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, etc.) plus 9 from 480-488. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40 plus 9=49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never is 8. Therefore, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.

So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 would go up to 449, but our book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included. Let me count how many numbers in each hundred. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers (40-49), so 10 occurrences. Similarly, 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 occurrences. Wait, but wait again. Wait, from 40-49: 10 numbers, correct. Then 140-149: another 10, so that's 20. 240-249: 30, 340-349: 40, 440-449: 50. So yes, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 occurrences of the digit 4. Now, I need to do the same for the digit 8. Let's go through each place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, the first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. Using the same arithmetic sequence approach: a_n = 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, 488 = 8 + 10(n-1). Subtract 8: 480 = 10(n-1). Divide by 10: 48 = n-1. So, n = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 380-389 is included, but 480-489 would only go up to 488. So, let's check each hundred. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-488: the tens digit is 8, so numbers are 480-488. That's 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, in the hundreds place, 480-488: tens digit is 8, so that's 9 occurrences. So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39. Wait, wait, let me recount. 80-89: 10. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49? Wait, no, 10+10=20, +10=30, +10=40, +9=49. Wait, that's 49. But wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 +1=9. So, yes, 9. So, total tens place occurrences: 49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 40, but now it's 49. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. Each hundred has a 80-89, which is 10 numbers. So, from 0-99: 80-89: 10. 100-199:180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, zero occurrences in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Wait, but wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought the tens place had 49, but let me check again. Wait, no, the units place had 49, and the tens place had 49, so total 98. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the 4's and 8's again. Starting with 4's: units place: 4,14,...,484. That's (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: that's 89 numbers, so 89. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, for 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488. That's (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0, since 800 is beyond 488. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The first occurrence is at 4, and the last is at 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 40-49: 10 numbers.\n   - 140-149: 10 numbers.\n   - 240-249: 10 numbers.\n   - 340-349: 10 numbers.\n   - 440-449: 10 numbers.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 400-488: 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1).\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 80-89: 10 numbers.\n   - 180-189: 10 numbers.\n   - 280-289: 10 numbers.\n   - 380-389: 10 numbers.\n   - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page).\n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " The total number of 4's in the units place is the number of terms in this sequence. The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The common difference is 10, so the number of terms can be found by ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 484 is the last term, so let me check: 484 is the 49th term because (484 - 4)/10 = 48, so 48 intervals, meaning 49 terms. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last occurrence in the units place would be 484, which is correct because 488 is in the hundreds place. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 40-49: that's one block. Then, 140-149: that's another, and so on. How many blocks are there? The hundreds digit can be 0 (for 40-49), 1 (140-149), 2 (240-249), 3 (340-349), and 4 (440-449). So that's 5 blocks in total. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50. Wait, but the last block is 440-449, and 449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 here, so each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's see how many full blocks there are and if the last block is partial. The blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each full block contributes 10 8's in the tens place. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 10 8's. Similarly, 180-189: another 10, and so on. The last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so only 9 numbers, but since 488 is the last page, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, so how many times does 8 appear in the tens place here? Each of these 9 numbers has 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 times. So, the total number of 8's in the tens place is: 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 4*10=40, plus the last partial block 480-488 contributing 9. So, total 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is one block, 180-189 is another, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So that's 5 blocks, but the last one is partial. So, 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10, so 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, is 9 numbers, each contributing 8 in the tens place, so 9. So, total 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times 8 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   - The 4 appears in the units place at 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.  \n   - Total 4's in units place: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - The 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   - Number of blocks: 5 (from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).  \n   - Each block contributes 10 4's.  \n   - Total 4's in tens place: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - The 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488.  \n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.  \n   - Total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   - The 8 appears in the units place at 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.  \n   - Total 8's in units place: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   - Full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389): 4 blocks, each contributing 10 8's.  \n   - Partial block (480-488): 9 numbers, each contributing 8 in the tens place.  \n   - Total 8's in tens place: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - The 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Total 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " So, the sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. To find how many terms are in this sequence, I can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: number of terms = ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. Here, the first term is 4, the last term is 484, and the common difference is 10. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set would be 440-449. Let me check: 440-449 is within 488, yes. So, each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 40-49 (which is 10 numbers), 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50. So, there are 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but hold on. The last page is 488, so the 440-449 range is okay because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 50 is correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. The first page with a 4 in the hundreds place is 400, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers, so each number contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, yes, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. So, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see: The first term is 8, the last term is 488. So, number of terms = ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. So, let's calculate each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: this is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, for the last range, it's 9 numbers. Therefore, total 8's in the tens place: 4 ranges with 10 each (4*10=40) plus 9 from the last range, totaling 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that can't be right because 188-98 is 90, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. Let me double-check that. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct. For the 8's, in the tens place, I had 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. That seems correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, total 98 8's. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me think again. When I count the 4's in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 is correct. For the 8's in the tens place, I think I might have missed something. Let me recount. The ranges where 8 is in the tens place are: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds: 98 total 8's. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I'm wondering if I made a mistake in the 4's count. Let me check the units place again. Units place for 4's: from 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. How many terms? The last term is 484, which is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 480/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's. 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but I'm feeling uncertain because 90 seems a bit high. Let me try a different approach to verify. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately again, just to make sure. Alternatively, I can think of each digit position separately for both digits. Let's try that. For 4's: Units, Tens, Hundreds. Units: 4,14,...,484: 49 numbers. Tens: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449: 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Hundreds: 400-488: 89 numbers. Total: 49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units: 8,18,...,488: Let's see, 488 is the last page. So, the last 8 in units place is 488. So, number of terms: (488 - 8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers). So, 40+9=49. Correct. Hundreds: No 8's in hundreds place because the book ends at 488. So, total 8's: 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, I just thought of something. When I count the 4's in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. But in the tens and units places within that range, are there any additional 4's? For example, in 404, there's a 4 in the hundreds and units place. Similarly, 414 has 4 in hundreds and units, etc. But when I counted the 4's in the hundreds place, I already included all those numbers, and when I counted the 4's in the units and tens places, I included all the numbers outside the hundreds place as well. So, I think my initial counting is correct because each digit is counted separately in their respective places. So, I think the total number of 4's is indeed 188, and 8's are 98, so the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the number of 8's. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Count the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term a1 = 4, the common difference d = 10, and the last term an = 484. To find the number of terms, I can use the formula: n = ((an - a1) / d) + 1. Plugging in the numbers: n = ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = (480 / 10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, I'll look at the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set in the tens place would be 440-449. Let me calculate how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, and the first set is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10, and so on. How many such sets are there? From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets. Each set contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, 5 sets * 10 = 50 occurrences. Wait, but I need to check if the last set, 440-449, is entirely within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 in the hundreds place appears in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? The first number is 400, and the last is 488. So, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The common difference is 10. Using the same formula: n = ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = (480 / 10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place. The 8 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count the number of sets. Each set is 10 numbers, except possibly the last one. The first set is 80-89, which is 10 numbers. Then 180-189, another 10, 280-289, 10, 380-389, 10, and 480-488. So, the first four sets are complete, and the last set is partial. Let's calculate each: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place. - 180-189: 10 8's. - 280-289: 10 8's. - 380-389: 10 8's. - 480-488: Here, the tens digit is 8, and the units digit goes from 0 to 8, so that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. Now, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 8 in the hundreds place would appear in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. There are 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.

    "text": " The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. To find the number of terms, I can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence. The nth term is a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, where a_1 is the first term, d is the common difference. Here, a_1 = 4, d = 10, a_n = 484. Plugging in: 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10 \u2192 484 - 4 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 480 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last such range would be 440-449 because 450-459, etc., would be beyond 488, but actually, 440-449 is within 488. Let me see: Each hundred has a set of ten numbers where the tens digit is 4. From 1-99, it's 40-49, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449? Yes, and 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, let me check: From 1-99: 40-49 \u2192 10. 100-199: 140-149 \u219210. 200-299: 240-249 \u219210. 300-399: 340-349 \u219210. 400-488: 440-449 \u219210. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5\u00d710=50. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. The first page with 4 in the hundreds place is 400, and the last is 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Using the same arithmetic sequence formula: a_n = 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, 488 - 8 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 480 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. Let me check each hundred: - 1-99: 80-89 \u219210 numbers. - 100-199: 180-189 \u219210. - 200-299: 280-289 \u219210. - 300-399: 380-389 \u219210. - 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book stops at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, how many in the tens place? Let's count each hundred: 1-99: 10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, but let me check if 480-488 is correct. From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers because 480 is the first, then 481, ..., up to 488, which is 488-480 +1 =9. So, yes, 9. So total tens place 8's: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences here. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, the number of 4's in the units place is the number of terms in the sequence 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 10. The nth term of this sequence can be found using the formula: a_n = a_1 + (n-1)*d, where a_1 is 4, d is 10, and a_n is 484. Plugging in the values: 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10 \u2192 480 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. Wait, but let me check: since 488 is the last page, the last units place with 4 is 484, which is correct. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then, 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but let me make sure that 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 up to page 488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, the count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's printed are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, the sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, 8 + 10(n-1) = 488 \u2192 10(n-1) = 480 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10. So that's 4 ranges, each contributing 10 8's, so 4*10=40 8's in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 480-489 is within the book. The book ends at 488, so 480-489 would be pages 480 to 488. So, in the tens place, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, in the tens place, the 8's occur in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's an additional 9 8's in the tens place. So, total in tens place: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 8's in the tens place. Wait, but I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. When I count the tens place, each full hundred has an 80-89 range, which contributes 10 8's. But in the last hundred, 400-488, the 80-89 would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, the 8's occur in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 4 full ranges (each contributing 10) and one partial range (contributing 9). So, total 4*10 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. Okay, that makes sense. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " The number of terms can be calculated by dividing 484 by 10 and adding 1. Wait, but 484 is the 48th term because 484 - 4 = 480, and 480 / 10 = 48, plus 1 gives 49. But wait, does 488 have a 4 in the units place? No, because 488 is 4-8-8, so the last 4 in the units place is 484. So, from 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where 4 is in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. Starting from 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, so that's 20. 240-249: 30, 340-349: 40, and 440-449: 50. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, how many ranges are there? From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449: that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 include 440 up to 449, which is 10 numbers, so yes. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where 8 is in the tens place. How many such ranges are there? From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 20, 280-289: 30, 380-389: 40. Wait, does 380-389 go up to 389, which is less than 488? Yes. So, that's 4 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 4 * 10 = 40 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers in the hundreds place that have 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, 89 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract 89 from 188: 188 - 89 = 99. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For 8's: units 49, tens 40, hundreds 0. Total 89. 188 - 89 = 99. Hmm, but wait, did I count correctly in the hundreds place for 4's? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. That's correct. For the tens place of 4's, I had 5 ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each gives 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. Units place for 4's: from 4,14,...,484, which is 49 numbers. Correct. For 8's, units place: 8,18,...,488, which is 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389: 4 ranges, 10 each, so 40. Hundreds place: none, correct. So, 49+40=89. So, 188-89=99. So, the answer should be 99 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 \u2192 40 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** None, as pages go up to 488 \u2192 0 occurrences.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 40 + 0 = 89.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 89 (8's) = 99.\n\n\\boxed{99}"

    "text": " The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. To find the number of terms, I can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: (Last term - First term) / Common difference + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set would be 440-449, since 450-488 don't have 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many sets there are. The first set is 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, there are 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see, the last occurrence is at 488. So, the sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Using the same formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me check how many full sets there are. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. Then 480-488: that's 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, the first four sets give 4 * 10 = 40, and the last set gives 9. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

    "text": " The number of terms in this sequence can be found by dividing 484 by 10 and taking the integer part. So, 484 / 10 = 48.4, so there are 48 occurrences. Wait, but 484 is the last one, so actually, from 4 to 484, that's 48 terms because 484 is the 48th term. So, 48 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The 4 appears in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where 4 is in the tens place. Let's see how many full decades we have. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then, each hundred has another 10, so 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many hundreds? 40-49 is in the first hundred, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets of 10 numbers each, so 5*10=50. Wait, but 440-449 is the fifth set, but does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's valid. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? Well, from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 +89=187. So, total 4's: 187.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is at 488. So, how many terms? The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. Let me see: Each full set is 10 numbers, so 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Now, the next set would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, only 480-488 are valid. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 480 +1=9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 480-488 contributes 9 numbers where 8 is in the tens place. So, total in tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=49+49=98.\n\nSo, number of 4's is 187, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 -98=89.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 4,14,...,484. Number of terms: (484-4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49? Wait, earlier I thought it was 48, but now I'm recalculating and getting 49. Wait, which is correct? Let me check with a smaller example. If I have page numbers up to 44, how many 4's in units place? 4,14,24,34,44. That's 5 terms. Using the formula: (44-4)/10 +1=40/10 +1=4+1=5. Correct. So, in the case of 484: (484-4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, I think earlier I made a mistake. It should be 49, not 48. So, units place for 4's: 49.\n\nTens place for 4's: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. From 40-49:10 numbers, then each hundred adds another 10. How many hundreds? 40-49 is in the 1st hundred, 140-149 in the 2nd, 240-249 in the 3rd, 340-349 in the 4th, 440-449 in the 5th. So, 5 sets, each 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so yes, 50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488. That's 488-400+1=89 numbers.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 187, but now it's 188. Let me check again. Units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits:8,18,...,488. How many terms? (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49.\n\nTens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each full set (80-89 etc.) is 10 numbers, so 4 full sets:4*10=40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, total 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: none, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 4's:188, 8's:98. Difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought the answer was 89, but now it's 90. Which is correct?\n\nLet me recount the units place for 4's. From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10) +1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in units place.\n\nTens place:40-49:10,140-149:10,240-249:10,340-349:10,440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each 10, so 50.\n\nHundreds place:400-488:89.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits:49.\n\nTens:49.\n\nTotal 8's:98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 89. Let me check the tens place for 4's again. Are there 5 sets? 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. Yes, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers. So, 4 full sets:40, plus 9, total 49.\n\nWait, but 80-89 is the first set, then 180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 5 sets, but the last set is incomplete. So, 4 full sets (each 10) and 1 partial set (9). So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, 4's total:188, 8's:98, difference 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 187, which was wrong. So, the correct difference is 90.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure about the hundreds place for 4's. 400-488: how many numbers? 488-400=88, plus 1=89. Correct.\n\nAnd units place for 4's:49.\n\nTens place:50.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188.\n\nUnits for 8's:49.\n\nTens for 8's:49.\n\nTotal 8's:98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488. Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each full set contributes 10, with the last set contributing 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** None, as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. To find how many terms there are, I can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: (Last term - First term) / Common difference + 1. Here, the common difference is 10. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 appears in the tens place for numbers from 40 to 49, 140 to 149, 240 to 249, 340 to 349, and 440 to 449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set would be 440 to 449. Each of these sets has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such sets there are. The first set is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. Now, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, there are 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many terms there are. The first term is 8, and the last term is 488. Using the same formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers from 80 to 89, 180 to 189, 280 to 289, 380 to 389, and 480 to 488. Wait, the last set is from 480 to 488 because 488 is the last page. So, let's count how many sets there are. The first set is 80-89 (10 numbers), then 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. The last set, 480-488, has 9 numbers because 480 is the first, then 481, ..., up to 488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9). So, the first four sets each contribute 10 8's in the tens place, and the last set contributes 9. So, 4 * 10 = 40, plus 9 gives 49. Therefore, there are 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800 and 899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 10.

Here, the first term is 4, the last term is 484, and the common difference is 10. So, n = ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count these ranges. - From 1-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. - From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. - From 200-299: 240-249 is another 10. - From 300-399: 340-349 is another 10. - From 400-488: 440-449 is another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50. But wait, the last range is 440-449, but the book only goes up to 488, so 449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours printed. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last occurrence in the units place is at 488. So, the sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Using the same formula: n = ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count these. - From 1-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. - From 100-199: 180-189 is another 10. - From 200-299: 280-289 is another 10. - From 300-399: 380-389 is another 10. Now, from 400-488: The next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, for the 400-488 range, the tens place 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 ranges of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and 9 from 480-488. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, that's 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights printed. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is an arithmetic sequence with 49 terms.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449, totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " The number of terms in this sequence can be found by dividing 484 by 10 and adding 1. Wait, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so taking the integer part, that's 48, and adding 1 gives 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set would be 440-449. Let me count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, so for each hundred, there's a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. From 1 to 488, there are 4 hundreds: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. In each of the first four hundreds (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), there's one set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So that's 4 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. But wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10, making it 5 sets, each with 10 numbers. So, 5*10=50. Wait, but earlier I thought the hundreds were 1-99, 100-199, etc., up to 400-488. So, 400-488 is part of the fifth hundred, but only up to 488. So, does that affect the count? Let me think. From 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, that's correct. So, total 5 sets, each with 10, so 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, every page from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up the units, tens, and hundreds places for 4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Wait, let me check that again. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems high. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the tens place. Let me recount the tens place. For each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50. That seems correct. And the hundreds place is 89, which is correct because from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place at 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many terms there are. The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms can be found by (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, except possibly the last one. So, from 1-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, how many sets? The first four sets are 10 each, and the last set is 9. So, total in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Adding up the units, tens, and hundreds places for 8: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, I'll count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The numbers where the tens digit is 4 are from 40 to 49, 140 to 149, 240 to 249, 340 to 349, and 440 to 449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set would be 440-449 and 480-489, but 488 is the last page, so up to 488. Let me check: 40-49: that's 10 numbers. 140-149: another 10. 240-249: 10. 340-349: 10. 440-449: 10. But wait, 480-488 is part of the book, so does the tens digit include 4 in the 480-488 range? Wait, no. The tens digit in 480 is 8, because 480 is 4 (hundreds), 8 (tens), 0 (units). So, the tens digit is 8 there, not 4. So, the last occurrence of 4 in the tens place is at 449. So, how many sets are there? Let's see: 40-49: 10 numbers. 140-149: 10. 240-249: 10. 340-349: 10. 440-449: 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 occurrences. Wait, but does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so all those are valid. So, 5 sets of 10, so 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. Wait, but let me double-check. From 40 to 49: 10 numbers. 140-149: another 10. 240-249: 10. 340-349: 10. 440-449: 10. So yes, 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50 in total. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? The first number is 400, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 occurrences of the digit 4. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place at 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many terms? The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The common difference is 10, so using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, that's 9. So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " The number of terms in this sequence can be calculated by dividing 484 by 10, which gives 48.4, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 = 4 + (48-1)*10. Let me check: 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484 => 10*(n-1) = 480 => n-1 = 48 => n=49. Oh, I think I made a mistake earlier. The correct number of 4's in the units place is 49. Because starting from 4, every 10th number adds another 4. So, from 4 to 484, that's 484/10 = 48.4, but since 484 is included, it's actually 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 appears in the tens place from 40 to 49, 140 to 149, 240 to 249, and 340 to 349. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 440 to 449 would be in the hundreds place as well, but the tens place for 4 would only go up to 349 because 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. Let me count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place (from 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. That would be 4*10=40. But wait, 400-488 is part of the 400 block, so the tens place 4's would be from 400-409, but since 488 is the end, does that affect it? Wait, no, because 400-409 are within 400-488, so the tens place 4's from 400-409 are included. So, 400-409 is 10 numbers, so that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's would be 40 (from 1-400) plus 10 (from 400-409), but wait, that would be overlapping. Wait, no, because 1-400 includes 400, so perhaps I should think differently. Alternatively, maybe it's better to calculate how many full hundreds are there. From 1-400, each hundred block has 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens place 4's would be in 440-449, which is another 10. So total tens place 4's would be 40 + 10=50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 +50=99; 99+89=188. So, total 4's are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, since the book goes up to 488, 380-389 is within 1-488, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so only up to 488. So, each hundred block contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except possibly the last one. Let's see: From 1-400, there are 4 blocks, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, from 401-488, the tens place 8's would be in 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's would be 40 (from 1-400) +9=49. Wait, but let me confirm: from 1-400, the tens place 8's are in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), so that's 40. Then, from 401-488, the next tens place 8's would be 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) -98 (number of 8's) =90. Wait, that's 90. Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit place again for both 4's and 8's to ensure I didn't make a mistake. **Counting 4's again:**\n- Units place: From 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n- Tens place: From 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each hundred block contributes 10, and from 1-400, that's 4 blocks, so 40. Then from 401-488, 440-449 is another 10, so total 50. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct.\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\n**Counting 8's again:**\n- Units place: From 8,18,...,488. Number of terms: ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n- Tens place: From 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks gives 10, so 40. Then 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 40+9=49. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 0.

    "text": " The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is an arithmetic sequence where the common difference is 10. To find the number of terms, I can use the formula: Number of terms = ((Last term - First term) / Common difference) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block would be 440-449, right? Let me check: 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, each hundred has a block of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many hundreds are there? From 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, 400-488 is a partial hundred. So, in each full hundred (like 1-99, 100-199, etc.), there's one block of 10 where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many full hundreds we have: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, 400-488 is not a full hundred, it's 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive). So, for the tens place, the number of 4's is as follows: - In 1-99: 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place. - In 100-199: 140-149, another 10. - Similarly, 240-249: 10. - 340-349: 10. - Now, 400-488: The tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449. That's another 10 numbers. So, that's 5 blocks each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, so that's correct. So, total 4's in the tens place: 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. Wait, but wait: 400-488 is only up to 488, so 440-449 is within that. So, yes, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. Each of these numbers has 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: Units place: 49, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. Total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many terms there are. The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The common difference is 10. Number of terms = ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is included, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of this. So, each hundred from 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488 has a block where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks? Let's see: - 1-99: 80-89, 10 numbers. - 100-199: 180-189, 10. - 200-299: 280-289, 10. - 300-399: 380-389, 10. - 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times, not 10. So, total 8's in the tens place: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 in the last partial block. So, total 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up the 8's: Units place: 49, Tens place: 49, Hundreds place: 0. Total 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks of 10 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449). There are 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in numbers 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks of 10 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488). There are 49 occurrences (with 480-488 contributing 9).\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The number of terms in this sequence can be calculated by taking (484 - 4)/10 + 1. That is (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many times 4 appears here. Each block of 100 numbers has a 4 in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). So, from 1-488, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 1-99: 40-49 (10 numbers) 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers) 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers) 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers) 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers) Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, from 400-488, the last occurrence in the tens place is 449, which is within 488. So, actually, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so yes, 50 in total. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Number of terms: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count each block: 1-99: 80-89 (10 numbers) 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers) 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers) 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers) 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, since 489 is beyond 488) So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we'll count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = **188**.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** None, as pages go up to 488 \u2192 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " The number of terms in this sequence can be calculated by dividing 484 by 10 and adding 1. Wait, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, but since we're dealing with whole numbers, it's 48 full decades plus the 4th number in the 480s. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, actually, let me think again. From 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is calculated by how many complete sets of 10 there are, which is 48 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets). But wait, each set contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, in the last partial set, from 480 to 488, the units digits go from 0 to 8, so 484 is included, which is another 4 in the units place. So, actually, it's 48 (from 1-480) plus 1 (from 484), totaling 49 times. Wait, but actually, from 1-488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete cycles of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then in the 49th cycle, which is 480-488, we have 484 as the only 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The 4 appears in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 540-549 would be beyond 488. So, how many sets of 100 are there? From 1-488, we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. Wait, no, actually, 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49, etc.). So, how many hundreds have a 4 in the tens place? Let's see: 40-49 in each hundred. So, from 1-400, there are 4 sets of 40-49 (each hundred contributes one set). So, that's 4 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. But wait, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 would be in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 4*10 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so 440-449 is within 488. So, yes, that's another 10. So total is 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but let me check: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. So that's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Yes, that's correct. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these numbers contributes a 4. So, that's 89 times. Wait, but let me think: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. So, total 4's in hundreds place: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's printed is 188. Now, let's do the same for 8's. I'll go through each digit position again. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. The number of terms is calculated by (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is within 488, so that's included. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 is the first, then 481, 482, ..., 488, which is 9 numbers). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers? Wait, 480 is the first, then 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers after 480, but including 480, it's 9 numbers? Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, 9 numbers. But wait, in the tens place, each of these numbers has 8 in the tens place. So, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers. So, that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, total 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's printed is 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, checking the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49. Let me recount. From 1-488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then in the 49th cycle, 484 is included, so 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 50. As I listed earlier, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each contributes 10, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 89. From 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89=188. Correct.\n\nNow, checking the 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49. From 8, 18, 28,...488. The last one is 488, which is 488-8=480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 49. As per earlier, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) and 9 from 480-488. So, 40 +9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 +49=98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly? Because sometimes when counting digit positions, it's easy to make an off-by-one error. Let me check the units place for 4's again. The first 4 is at 4, then every 10. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, (484 -4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place for 4's: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each 10, so 50.

    "text": " The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. To find how many terms there are, I can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: number of terms = ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. Here, last term is 484, first term is 4, common difference is 10. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 480-489 isn't, but 488 is the last page. So, let's count each range: - 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place. - 140-149: another 10 4's. - 240-249: another 10. - 340-349: another 10. - 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. The number of terms is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, similar to the 4's in units place. Let's see: first term is 8, last term is 488. Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is included. Let's count each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers, 10 8's. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: how many numbers? From 480 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, 9 8's in the tens place. So total in tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and one range of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where 8 is in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.  \n   - Each range contributes 10 4's, totaling 5*10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488.  \n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.  \n   - 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 each contribute 10 8's.  \n   - 480-488 contributes 9 8's.  \n   - Total: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers here, as the book ends at 488.  \n   - Total: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Wait, but 484 is the last page, so does it include 484? Yes, because 484 is within 488. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for every block of 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 440-449. Let me count how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 all exist? Since the book goes up to 488, yes, 449 is within 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 up to 488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. Using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let me count the blocks: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last page). So, the first four blocks contribute 4 * 10 = 40, and the last block contributes 9. So, total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the hundreds place with 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, ..., 484, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449, totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, ..., 488, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488, totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " The total number of 4's in the units place can be calculated by seeing how many steps of 10 are there between 4 and 484. The formula would be ((484 - 4)/10) + 1. Let's compute that: (480)/10 = 48, so 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is okay, but 440-449 is within 488. Let me check how many such sets there are. Each hundred has a set of 10 numbers where 4 is in the tens place. From 1-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's. So, 5*10=50. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. Using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1. That's (480)/10=48, so 48 +1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, let's adjust for that. From 1-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, since 489 is beyond 488). So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. That's 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set would be 440-449. Let me check: 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, how many such sets are there? From 40-49: that's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences. Then, 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 occurrences. So, 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so that's okay. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but the hundreds digit is only 4 in 400-488, right? So, that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 occurrences of the digit 4. Now, I need to count the number of 8's. Let's do the same approach for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, the last occurrence in the units place is 488. Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The first term a1=8, common difference d=10, last term an=488. Number of terms: n = ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me check how many sets there are. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: that's 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, the first four sets contribute 10 each, and the last set contributes 9. So total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9=40+9=49. Wait, but let me make sure. The first set is 80-89: 10 numbers. Second:180-189:10. Third:280-289:10. Fourth:380-389:10. Fifth:480-488: from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, yes, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me recount the 4's and 8's. For 4's: Units: 4,14,...,484: 484 is 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 484=4+10(n-1). So, 480=10(n-1), so n-1=48, n=49. Correct. Tens: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds: 400-488:488-400+1=89. Correct. So total 4's:49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units:8,18,...,488:488-8=480, 480/10=48, so 48+1=49. Correct. Tens:80-89:10,180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds: none. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, difference:188-98=90. Wait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. In the tens place, when counting 80-89, that's 10 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. Similarly for 180-189, etc. But in the last set, 480-488, that's only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 9 occurrences in the tens place for that set. So, total tens place 8's:4*10 +9=49. Correct. So, I think my calculation is correct.

    "text": " The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. To find how many terms there are, I can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: number of terms = ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. Here, the first term is 4, the last term is 484, and the common difference is 10. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me count how many times this happens. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place. Similarly, from 140-149: another 10. Then 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is okay because 449 is less than 488. So that's 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Let me see how many numbers that is. The first number is 400, and the last is 488. To count how many numbers, it's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place at 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many terms there are. The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The common difference is 10. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let me check each set. From 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-488: that's 480, 481, ..., 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, that's 9 8's in the tens place. So, total in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, is that right? Let me add again: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So 10+10=20, +10=30, +10=40, +9=49. Yes, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears at 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n   \n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10, totaling 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears at 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four sets contribute 10 each, and the last set contributes 9.\n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " The number of terms in this sequence can be found by dividing 484 by 10, which gives 48.4, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 484 is the last one, so actually, it's 484/10 = 48.4, so 48 full decades, but the 48th decade ends at 480, so the 484 is the 48th term? Hmm, maybe I should calculate it differently. The number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 itself ends with an 8, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484. So, from 4 to 484, how many 4's? Let's see: the first 4 is at 4, then every 10 pages after that. So, the positions are 4,14,24,...,484. To find how many terms, I can compute ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Wait, that makes sense because 484 is the 49th term. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by just taking 488/10. So, correct number of 4's in units place is 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let me figure out how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49, which is in the first hundred (1-100). The next is 140-149 in the second hundred (101-200), then 240-249 in the third hundred (201-300), 340-349 in the fourth hundred (301-400), and finally 440-449 in the fifth hundred (401-500). However, the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 440-449. So, how many blocks are there? From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5*10=50. But wait, the last block is 440-449, which is within 401-488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units place 49, tens place 50, hundreds place 89. Total 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's count how many. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the number of terms is ((488 -8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 block, but since the book ends at 488, we only go up to 488. So, let's count the blocks: 80-89 (first block), 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 8's in the tens place. The last block, 480-488, contributes how many? From 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers. So, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, total 8's in the tens place: 4 blocks *10 +9=40+9=49. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 block, but since the book ends at 488, we have 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, the tens digit is 8 for all these, so that's 9 8's in the tens place. So, the total tens place 8's: 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10, so 4*10=40, plus the 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds place 0. Total 8's =49+49=98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the Digit 4:**\n1. **Units Place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but since the book goes up to 488, 440-449 is valid, but 540-549 would be beyond 488, so I don't need to consider that. Let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers (e.g., 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. From 1-400, there are 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 occurrences, so that's 4*10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens place is 4 for 401-410, 411-420, etc., but wait, that's not correct. Wait, no, the tens place is 4 in 401-410? No, 401 has tens digit 0, 410 has tens digit 1. Wait, no, I'm confusing. The tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's another 10 occurrences. So total in the tens place would be 40 (from 1-400) plus 10 (from 440-449) = 50. Wait, but let me check that again. From 1-400, each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349. That's 4 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the next occurrence of the tens digit being 4 is in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 page numbers. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, first term 8, last term 488, common difference 10. Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is valid. Let's count: From 1-400, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 4 blocks *10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 occurrences. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0. Therefore, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, but does 488 have a units digit of 4? No, it's 8, so the last 4 in the units place is indeed 484. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 would go up to 449, but the book has 488 pages, so 440-449 is okay. Let me count how many such blocks there are. Each block is 10 numbers, and each block contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many blocks are there? From 40-49: that's the first block. Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. So, the first page with 4 in the hundreds place is 400, and the last is 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, I need to count how many times 8 appears. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many terms there are. The first term is 8, the last term is 488. Using the same formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is included, so that's correct. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let me see: how many complete blocks are there? 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences. Then, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, for the tens place, it's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 4\u00d710 +9=49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences here. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when counting the tens place for 8's, I included 480-488 as 9 numbers, but in the tens place, each of these numbers has an 8 in the tens place, so that's correct. Similarly, for 4's in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is correct. I think that's accurate. So, the difference is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '4' appears in the units place for page numbers 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This forms an arithmetic sequence with the first term 4 and the last term 484. The number of terms is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of terms} = \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '4' appears in the tens place for page numbers 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of terms} = 5 \\times 10 = 50\n     \\]\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place for page numbers 400-488.

The number of terms is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of terms} = \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '8' appears in the tens place for page numbers 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks each contribute 10 occurrences, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 occurrences:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of terms} = 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49\n     \\]\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is '8' since the book ends at page 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** \n     \\[\n     49 (\\text{units}) + 49 (\\text{tens}) + 0 (\\text{hundreds}) = 98\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = 188 (\\text{number of '4's}) - 98 (\\text{number of '8's}) = 90\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 times more than the digit '8'.

    "text": " The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. To find how many terms there are, I can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: number of terms = ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. Here, the first term is 4, the last term is 484, and the common difference is 10. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set would be 440-449. Let me count how many full decades there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, and so on. How many such sets are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first set in the 40s. Then 140-149 is in the 140s, 240-249 in the 240s, 340-349 in the 340s, and 440-449 in the 440s. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. Wait, no, 400-488 is the range where the hundreds digit is 4. So, every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, but I think I might be making a mistake here. Because in the hundreds place, the 4 only appears in the hundreds digit, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, yes, 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, I'll do the same for 8's. Let's go through each digit position again: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me check if 488 is included. Yes, because 488 ends with an 8. So, the first term is 8, the last term is 488. Using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-489 would only go up to 488. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10, and 480-488: how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, we have 4 full decades (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 8's, and then 9 more from 480-488. So, 4 * 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. Wait, but let me double-check. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait a minute. Let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. And for the tens place, 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. Units place: 49. So, 188. For 8's, units place:49, tens place:49, so 98. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but I'm wondering if I counted correctly for the tens place of 8's. Let me recount. For tens place 8's: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So that's 4*10 +9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '4' appears in the units place for every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

Here, the first term is 4, the last term is 484, and the common difference is 10. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens place is the second digit from the right. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such ranges there are. The first is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many ranges? From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, I should check if 440-449 is within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's valid. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place is the third digit from the right. In a 3-digit number, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 since the book goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? The first number is 400, and the last is 488. The count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. But wait, I'm only interested in when the hundreds digit is 4, so every number from 400 to 488 has 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 numbers. However, I need to check if 488 is included. Yes, because 488 is the last page. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many terms there are. The first term is 8, the last term is 488. Common difference is 10. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. The ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-489 would be up to 488. So, let's check each range: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, total in tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4, but 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as pages go up to 488 \u2192 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. Wait, but the last page is 488, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is correct. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. So, there are 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but let me check. The last range is 440-449, which is within 488, so yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers. The first occurrence is at 8, then 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The common difference is 10. So, number of terms = ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count the ranges: From 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. Now, from 400-488: The next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the last number with 8 in the tens place is 488. So, from 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. That's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, instead of 10, it's 9. So, the ranges are 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.

Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 full ranges, each contributing 10 4's. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences. But wait, let me check: 40-49 is 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place. Similarly for 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. So that's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This happens from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full decades, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times. Wait, because 8 occurs at 8, 18, ..., 488. Let me think: from 1 to 488, how many multiples of 10 plus 8? The first is 8, then 18, ..., up to 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. Let me count how many full ranges there are. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10. So that's 4 ranges, each contributing 10, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 occurrences. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, etc., up to 380-389. So, 4 ranges, 40 in total. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences here. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, there are 89 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 89 (8's) = 98. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units place was 48, tens was 50, hundreds was 89. 48+50=98, plus 89 is 187. That seems correct. For the 8's: units was 49, tens was 40, hundreds was 0. 49+40=89. So, 187-89=98. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in counting the units place for 4's. Let me check that again. The units place for 4's goes from 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The first term is 4, the last term is 484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Wait, so earlier I thought it was 48, but actually, it's 49. Because 4 is the first, then every 10 after that, so 4,14,...,484. Let me confirm: 484 is 48*10 +4, so the number of terms is 48 +1 =49. So, I think I made a mistake there. So, units place for 4's is 49, not 48. Similarly, for the 8's, units place was 49, which is correct. So, correcting that, the total number of 4's is 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Wait, no, 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's are 188. Now, 8's were 89. So, 188-89=99. Wait, so I think I made an error in the initial count of 4's in the units place. Let me recount that. The units digit 4 occurs at 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. So, units place for 4's is 49, not 48. So, total 4's: 49+50+89=188. 8's:49+40=89. So, 188-89=99. So, the correct answer should be 99 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but earlier I thought 4's were 187, but that was wrong. So, the correct total is 188 4's and 89 8's, so the difference is 99. Hmm, I think that's the right answer. Let me just make sure I didn't make any other mistakes. Let me recount the 4's: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. 8's: units:49, tens:40, hundreds:0. 49+40=89. 188-89=99. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 40.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 40 + 0 = 89.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 89 (8's) = 99.\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 99.\n\n$\\boxed{99}$"

    "text": " The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. To find the number of terms, I can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: (Last term - First term) / Common difference + 1. Here, the first term is 4, the last term is 484, and the common difference is 10. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for every block of 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: from 40-49: 10 numbers, 40-49, that's 10. Then 140-149: another 10, so 20. 240-249: 30. 340-349: 40. 440-449: 50. So, yes, 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50 4's. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. Now, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first, then 401, ..., up to 488. So, yes, 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, let's add up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is at 488. So, starting at 8, each step of 10. Let's calculate how many terms: The first term is 8, last term is 488. The common difference is 10. So, number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place for every block of 100 numbers. So, from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, let's count the number of blocks where the tens digit is 8. The first block is 80-89: 10 numbers. Then 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Then 480-488: 9 numbers. So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, total 8's in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189: 20, 280-289: 30, 380-389: 40, 480-488: 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above. But since the book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit can never be 8. So, there are 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The 4 appears in the units place at 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is an arithmetic sequence with the first term 4, last term 484, and common difference 10. The number of terms is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n   So, 49 4's in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 4's:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 10 = 50\n   \\]\n   So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. There are 89 numbers here (488 - 400 + 1):\n   \\[\n   89\n   \\]\n   So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**\n\\[\n49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place at 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is an arithmetic sequence with the first term 8, last term 488, and common difference 10. The number of terms is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n   So, 49 8's in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49\n   \\]\n   So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book only has 488 pages.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**\n\\[\n49 + 49 = 98\n\\]\n\n**Difference:**\n\\[\n188 - 98 = 90\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
