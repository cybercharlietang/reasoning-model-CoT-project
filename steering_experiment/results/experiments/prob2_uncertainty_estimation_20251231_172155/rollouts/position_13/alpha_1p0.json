    "text": " Let me calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place. Since the book goes up to 488, the last page with a 4 in the units place is 484. So, from 4 to 484, how many numbers are there? The formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. Here, the first term is 4, the last term is 484, and the common difference is 10. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 instances where 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, I'll look at the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid, but 540-549 would be beyond 488. Let me count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has a set of 10 where the tens digit is 4. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, from 1 to 488, how many such blocks are there? The first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), the second is 140-149 (another 10), then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks in total. Each block contributes 10 instances of 4 in the tens place, so 5 blocks would be 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, I should check if 440-449 is fully within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 instances. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, looking at the hundreds place, the 4 can appear in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the instances where 4 appears: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times. Now, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Let's go through each digit position again: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Using the same formula as before: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 instances. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. Let me count how many blocks of 100 have the tens digit as 8. Each block contributes 10 instances except possibly the last one. From 1-488, the blocks are: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers). So, the first four blocks contribute 4 * 10 = 40, and the last block contributes 9. So, total in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me confirm. 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 instances. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, the digit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all instances where 8 appears: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. Correct. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, let me check the tens place for 4 again. I said 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10, so 50. The blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. For 8's in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. That's 5 blocks, but the last one has only 9 numbers. So, 4*10 + 9=49. Correct. So, yes, the difference is 90. Therefore, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 instances, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Let me see, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4. The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. To find how many terms there are, I can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence. The nth term is given by a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, where a_1 is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms. Here, a_1 = 4, d = 10, a_n = 484. So, 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 4 from both sides: 480 = (n-1)*10. Divide both sides by 10: 48 = n-1. So, n = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5*10 = 50 occurrences. But wait, I should check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Since 449 is less than 488, it's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. Each number here has 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 occurrences of the digit 4. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The sequence starts at 8 and ends at 488. Using the same arithmetic sequence approach: a_1 = 8, d = 10, a_n = 488. So, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 8: 480 = (n-1)*10. Divide by 10: 48 = n-1. So, n = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 can appear in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count the ranges: From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-489, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, how many ranges have full 10 numbers? The first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 numbers, so that's 4*10=40. Then, in the 400-488 range, it's only 9 numbers. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 occurrences of the digit 8. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences (since pages go up to 488).\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me calculate how many times this happens. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, it's 48 times. Wait, but actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full cycles and then 8 more pages. So, each cycle contributes one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 have a 4 in the units place? No, because 488 ends with an 8. So, the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers) From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers) From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers) From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers) Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 end at 449, which is within 488? Yes, so that's fine. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times. Now, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me calculate how many times this happens. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, and then 8 more pages (481-488), where 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but let me check: the first 8 is at 8, then 18, ..., up to 488. So, how many 8's in the units place? It's the number of times 8 appears in the units digit from 1 to 488. That's 488 // 10 = 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, and then in the last partial ten (481-488), 488 has an 8, so that's 49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except possibly the last one if it's cut short. Let's check: From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers) From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers) From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers) From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so the tens digit is 8 for all of these. So, that's 9 numbers. So, the tens place 8's are: 4 ranges of 10 and one range of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me make sure. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, etc.) gives 10 8's in the tens place, and 480-488 gives 9, so total is 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that seems off because earlier I thought the units place was 49 and tens place was 49, so total 98. But let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. So, total 98 8's. Wait, but let me check the tens place again. For the range 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all numbers from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's correct. So, 4 full decades (each contributing 10) and one partial decade contributing 9, so 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, yes, 49 in tens place. So, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again. First, the 4's: units place 48, tens place 50, hundreds place 89. 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. That seems correct. Now, 8's: units place 49, tens place 49, so 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in the hundreds place, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me verify the hundreds place for 4's: from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 is correct. For 8's, the hundreds place never occurs because 800 is beyond 488. So, 0 is correct there. Now, let me check the tens place for 4's: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. For the tens place in 8's: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Units place for 4's: from 4,14,...,484. How many? Let's see: 484 is the last one. So, 484 is 484, which is 484-4=480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 (since inclusive), so 49. Wait, wait, earlier I thought it was 48, but now I'm confused. Let me recalculate the units place for 4's. The units digit is 4 every 10 numbers. So, starting at 4, then 14, 24,...,484. How many terms are there? The sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. This is an arithmetic sequence where a1=4, d=10, and last term an=484. The nth term is a1 + (n-1)d = 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, 4 +10(n-1)=484 => 10(n-1)=480 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. That was a mistake. So, the correct count for units place 4's is 49. Similarly, for units place 8's, it's 49 as well. So, I made a mistake earlier when I thought units place 4's were 48. It's actually 49. So, let's correct that. So, for 4's: units place 49, tens place 50, hundreds place 89. Total 49+50=99, plus 89=188. Wait, that's different. So, earlier I thought units place for 4's was 48, but it's actually 49. So, 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188. Now, for 8's: units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds place 0. So, total 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, so I initially thought 187-98=89, but after correcting the units place for 4's, it's 188-98=90. So, the correct answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me make sure. Let me recount the units place for 4's. From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? As I calculated, n=49. So, 49 terms. So, units place 4's:49. Earlier, I thought it was 48 because I was dividing 488 by 10, which gives 48.8, so 48 full cycles, but in reality, the last term is 484, which is the 49th term. So, 49 is correct. So, 49 units, 50 tens, 89 hundreds: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0: total 98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me check another way. Maybe I can write a small program or use another counting method to confirm. Alternatively, perhaps I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place more carefully. Let's try again. For 4's: Units place: numbers ending with 4 from 4 to 484. As above, that's 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers except possibly the last one. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so it's 10 numbers. So, 5 ranges, each 10 numbers: 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units place: numbers ending with 8 from 8 to 488. How many? The first is 8, then 18, 28,...,488. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, and then in the last partial cycle, 488 has an 8. So, 48+1=49. Alternatively, as before, the sequence is 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place:49. Tens place: numbers where the tens digit is 8. These are 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, and the last has 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place:49. Hundreds place:0. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 4's:188, 8's:98. Difference:188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. But wait, earlier I thought it was 89, but after correcting the units place for 4's, it's 90. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 -400 +1=89 numbers. So, 89 is correct. So, yes, 4's total to 188, 8's to 98, difference 90. So, the final answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 10.\n   - The number of terms is calculated as ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place in the range 400-488.\n   - This is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - The number of terms is ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Let me see, from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place. Well, every 10 numbers, there's one 4. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a number, it's 48 full tens, which gives 48 fours. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does 488 have a 4 in the units place? No, it's 488, which ends with an 8. So, the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, that's 48 fours in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one set, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. That would be from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction, it's 48 full tens, which gives 48 eights. But wait, 488 ends with an 8, so that's included. So, 48 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 80-89 is one set, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-489, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 numbers instead of 10. So, for the hundreds place in the tens digit, it's 9 eights instead of 10. So, how many sets? Let's count: 1-99: 10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, total in the tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 49 + 0. That's 97 eights. Wait, let me check that again. Units place: 48 eights. Tens place: 49 eights. So, 48+49=97. So, 97 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's:187, total 8's:97. So, 187 - 97 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range. Let me calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full cycles of 10, and then 8 more numbers. In each full cycle, 4 appears once in the units place. So, that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within range, but 480-489 would be beyond 488. Wait, no, 480-489 is beyond 488, so we only have up to 440-449. Let me count how many tens places are 4. Each block of 100 numbers has a 4 in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). So, from 1-488, how many such blocks are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. In each of the first four hundreds, the 40-49 block occurs, so that's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 numbers = 40. Then, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 401-409, which is 9 numbers, but wait, 401-409 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 0 for 401-409, right? Wait, no. Wait, 401-409: the tens digit is 0 because it's 401, 402, etc. So, actually, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 10 in 440-449, making it 50. Wait, but 440-449 is part of the 400-488 range, which is the fifth hundred. So, perhaps I should think differently. Let me try another approach. The tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so that's 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 1-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, total 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4. This occurs from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me calculate how many times. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 \u00d7 1 = 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This occurs in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: Here, the tens digit is 8, but the numbers go from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in this range, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can't be 8 because 800 is beyond 488. So, the hundreds digit is 8 only in 800-899, which isn't part of our book. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, this occurs 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, occurring 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit within 1-488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is the last one with a 4 in the units place. To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can calculate how many groups of 10 there are in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're dealing with whole numbers, that means 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 48 times 10 is 480, so from 1 to 480, there are 48 4's in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, we have 484, which is another 4. So that's 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but let me check: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each ten, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the number of 4's in the units place is the number of tens, which is 48 full tens (1-480) plus one more at 484, making it 49. Hmm, maybe that's correct. 2. **Tens place:** Now, for the tens place, 4 can appear in the tens digit, like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449, but wait, our book goes up to 488, so the last group would be 440-449. How many such groups are there? Each hundred has one group where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-99, there's 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then from 100-199, 140-149, another 10. Similarly, from 200-299, 240-249, another 10. From 300-399, 340-349, another 10. From 400-488, 440-449, which is 10 numbers as well. So, that's 5 groups, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. Wait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is 10, 240-249 is 10, 340-349 is 10, and 440-449 is 10. So yes, that's 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing an 8 in the units place. Then, 488 is the last page, which has an 8 in the units place. So, from 1-480, that's 48 8's, and then 488 is another one, so total 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place. Wait, but let me check: 488 is included, so yes, 49. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, from 400-488, the tens digit can be 8 in 480-488, but that's only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, let's count each group: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers, since 488 is the last page, so from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 5 groups, but the last one has 9 instead of 10. So, total 8's in the tens place: 4 groups of 10, which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. I said 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So that's 4 groups of 10 and one group of 9, totaling 49. That seems right. Similarly, for 4's in the tens place, I had 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449, each contributing 10, so 5 groups, 50 in total. So, 50 for 4's in tens place. Wait, but in the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. That seems correct. So, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct. I think I'm confident with that answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (1s):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of 4's: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens Place (10s):**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges.\n   - Number of 4's: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds Place (100s):**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - Number of 4's: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (1s):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of 8's: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens Place (10s):**\n   - 8 appears in ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last range contributes 9.\n   - Number of 8's: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds Place (100s):**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**\n\\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, 449 is less than 488, so all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these 89 numbers. Therefore, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers, the units digit is 8. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many? Let me see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, meaning 48 numbers ending with 8. But wait, 488 is included, so the last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, because 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. Let me check: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, the next is 18, and so on, up to 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be another block, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Let me count each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 times. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, as 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, adding up: 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed in the book.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 48 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This totals 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences as the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Let me calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place. From 1 to 488, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 4, and then a partial block from 481 to 488, which includes 484. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, and then the remainder is 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 times for each full block, but in the last partial block, since 484 is within 481-488, that's one more. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's look at the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks exist. From 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall entirely within 400-488? Yes, since 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Each number in this range has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's calculate how many times 8 appears in the units place. From 1 to 488, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one 8 in the units place. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, and the last partial block from 481-488 includes 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place, except possibly the last one if it doesn't complete the full 10 numbers. Let's check: From 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 how many numbers? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens place 8's are from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. Therefore, the tens place 8's are: 4 blocks of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 4*10=40, plus the 9 in 480-488. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, subtracting the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 48 full blocks of 10 (48 \u00d7 1) + 1 in the partial block = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Total blocks: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 48 full blocks of 10 (48 \u00d7 1) + 1 in the partial block = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each full block contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Partial block (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, 484 is within 488, so that's okay. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, the number of 4's in the units place is the number of complete groups of 10, which is 488 divided by 10, but since we can't have a fraction, we take the floor of that. 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 times. But wait, from 1 to 488, the last group is 481-490, but since we stop at 488, the 48th group ends at 480, and then we have 481-488, which is only 8 numbers. So, does that mean there's an extra 4 in the units place at 484? Wait, 484 is in the 48th group, right? Because 480 is the end of the 48th group, and 481-488 is the 49th group, but only up to 488. So, in the 49th group, 484 is the 4th number (481, 482, 483, 484). So, the 48th group ends at 480, and the 49th group from 481 to 488 includes 484. So, that's one more 4 in the units place. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but wait, when I divide 488 by 10, I get 48.8, which is 48 full groups and 0.8 of the next group. But 0.8 of 10 is 8, so the 49th group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in each full group, there's one 4 in the units place. So, 48 groups \u00d7 1 = 48, plus in the partial group, does 484 have a 4? Yes, so that's one more, making it 49. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? Let's see: starting from 40-49 (which is 10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Now, the book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, but 540-549 would be beyond 488, so we don't have that. So, how many blocks? 40-49: 1 block, 140-149: 1, 240-249: 1, 340-349: 1, 440-449: 1. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, does the 440-449 block go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But we're only concerned with the hundreds digit being 4. Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Now, the 49th group is 481-488. In this group, the numbers are 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place, such as 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count the blocks: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: here, 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 4 \u00d7 10 = 40, plus the 480-488 block, which is 9. So, total 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Let me calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place. Since it's every 10 numbers, from 1 to 488, there are 488 / 10 = 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction, it's 48 full sets of 10, and then 8 extra numbers. Wait, actually, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let me think differently. For each ten, like 1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 481-488. So, in each ten, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. How many tens are there? From 1 to 488, there are 488 tens? No, wait, that's not right. Each ten is a group of 10 numbers, so the number of tens is 488 / 10 = 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction, it's 48 full tens (1-480) and then 8 more numbers (481-488). So, in each of the 48 full tens, the units digit 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial ten (481-488), we check if 484 is included. 484 is within 481-488, so that's another 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449, and then 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488. Let me count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. How many hundreds are there? From 1-488, there are four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so we have four full hundreds (1-400) and then 401-488. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, for the first four hundreds (1-400), that's 4 sets, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 480-488. So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, that's 9 more 4's. So total tens place 4's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place, which is from 400-488. So, in the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 49 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, and 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each ten, the units digit 8 appears once, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial ten (481-488), 488 is included, so that's another 8 in the units place. So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place, such as 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count these. Each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers. So, from 1-488, how many hundreds? Four full hundreds (1-400) and 401-488. In each full hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times: 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, for four hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, that's 9 more 8's. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89.

    "text": " Let me calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place. Since the book has 488 pages, the last page is 488, so the units digit 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. To find how many terms there are, I can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: number of terms = ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. Here, first term is 4, last term is 484, common difference is 10. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place for page numbers from 400 to 488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the counts from each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the digit 8, checking each place: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's calculate how many times. First term is 8, last term is 488. Using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: Here, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, because 480-489 would be 10, but we only go up to 488, so it's 9 numbers. So, the first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last one contributes 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the counts: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Let me calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place. Since it's every 10 numbers, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, I take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the 48th group would be pages 480-488. Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but the 48th group is 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last 4 in the units place is 484. So, how many 4's in the units place? Let me think: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction, it's 48 times, but wait, the 48th time would be 480-489, but the book ends at 488, so the 48th 4 in the units place is 484. So, that's 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488, so all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so that's 89 times. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 89 times. Now, let me add up the number of 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, but the last group is 480-488, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many such ranges? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 ranges, but the last one has only 9 numbers. So, for the first four ranges, each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, and the last one contributes 9. So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the number of 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, 97 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, I subtract: 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. For the 8's: units 48, tens 49, hundreds 0. 48+49=97. So, 187-97=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '4' appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Let me calculate how many times this happens. The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The difference between each term is 10, so it's an arithmetic sequence. The nth term can be given by a_n = 4 + (n-1)*10. Setting a_n = 484, so 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. Subtract 4: (n-1)*10 = 480. Divide by 10: n-1 = 48. So n = 49. So there are 49 4's in the units place. Wait, but 484 is the 49th term because starting from 4 (n=1), each step adds 10. So yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count each of these ranges. - 40-49: That's 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place. - 140-149: Another 10 numbers, so another 10 4's. - 240-249: Another 10. - 340-349: Another 10. - 440-449: Another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's. So 5*10 = 50. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, right? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's okay. So 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. Let's see how many numbers that is. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in each of these, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, no, actually, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So 89 4's. Now, let me add them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many terms there are. The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. Setting equal to 488: 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. Subtract 8: (n-1)*10 = 480. Divide by 10: n-1 = 48, so n=49. So 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), because 488 is the last page. Let's count each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So that's 4 ranges of 10 and one range of 9. So 4*10 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Wait, no, let me double-check the tens place. 80-89: 10 8's in the tens place. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. So yes, 49 in tens place. So total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. So 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.

    "text": " Let me see, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place. Well, every 10 numbers, it appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, in the units place, 4 appears 49 times because 488 is the 49th occurrence? Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, but 488's units digit is 8, not 4. So, the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, let me think again. If I take 488 divided by 10, that's 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, that's 48 times. But wait, 488 is the 49th group, but the units digit in 488 is 8, so the 49th group doesn't add another 4 in the units place. So, it's 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one range, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. That would be from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me confirm: from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. How many times? Well, from 1 to 488, how many multiples of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, and its units digit is 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which contributes 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers, since 488 is the last page). So, let's count: from 1-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is 10. From 200-299: 280-289 is 10. From 300-399: 380-389 is 10. From 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place: 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 89. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, I'm a bit confused about the units place for 4's. Earlier, I thought 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 times. But then I realized that 488 is the last page, and the units digit in 488 is 8, not 4, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which would be the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, because 484 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 4. Wait, let me think again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for units digit 4, the numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. How many such numbers are there? Let's see: The first is 4, and the last is 484. The difference between 484 and 4 is 480, which is 48\u00d710. So, the number of terms is 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Wait, so that's 49 times. But earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there. Let me clarify. The number of times a digit appears in the units place can be calculated as floor((n + 1)/10), where n is the last page number. So, for 4's in units place: floor((488 +1)/10)=floor(489/10)=48.9, which is 48. So, 48 times. Wait, but that contradicts the earlier calculation. Let me check with a smaller number. Suppose n=14. How many 4's in units place? 4,14. That's 2 times. Using the formula: floor((14+1)/10)=floor(15/10)=1, which is incorrect because there are 2 times. Hmm, maybe the formula isn't correct. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of it as (last occurrence - first occurrence)/step +1. So, for units digit 4, first occurrence is 4, last occurrence is 484. So, (484 -4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, that's 49 times. So, I think earlier I was wrong when I said 48 times. It should be 49 times. So, that changes the total number of 4's. So, units place for 4's: 49. Tens place: 50. Hundreds place:89. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. Now, for 8's: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds place:0. So, total 8's:98. So, difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 89. So, I must have made a mistake in the units place for 4's. Let me confirm again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? They are 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but earlier I thought 488's units digit is 8, so 484 is the last 4 in the units place. So, that's correct. So, the number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90. But wait, let me check the 8's in the tens place again. From 80-89:10 numbers. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, that's correct. So, 8's:49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds: total 98. So, 4's:188, 8's:98. Difference is 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 89. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcounting somewhere. Let me try another approach. For each digit position, count the number of 4's and 8's. Units place: For 4's: as above, 49. For 8's:49. Tens place: For 4's: 50. For 8's:49. Hundreds place: For 4's:89. For 8's:0. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. Total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. But wait, let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, inclusive. How many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, each of these has 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 times. That's correct. So, yes, 89 times. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. 8's:49+49=98. So, difference is 90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such occurrences (from 4 to 484).\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges, totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit 4 appears in page numbers 400-488. There are 89 such numbers.\n\n   **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences (from 8 to 488).\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.

    "text": " Let me see, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many blocks of 10 are there in 488? That's 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 488 have a 4 in the units place? Yes, 484 is the last one before 488. So, 48 times. So, 48 fours in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one block, that's 10 fours. From 100-199: 140-149 is another block, another 10 fours. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? 440-449 is 10 numbers, and 449 is less than 488. So, how many blocks is that? Let's see: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. So, all page numbers from 400 to 488 have a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I need to count how many times 8 appears in the units, tens, and hundreds places across all page numbers from 1 to 488. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 is the last page, so it does. So, how many 8's in the units place? Again, every block of 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. So, total blocks from 1 to 488 is 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, but 488 is the 49th block. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does that add an extra 8 in the units place? Let me think. The first block is 1-10, which includes 8. The next is 11-20, which includes 18, and so on. The last block is 481-490, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 481-488. So, how many 8's in the units place? Each block contributes one, so from 1-480, there are 48 blocks, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48. Then, in 481-488, the 8 in the units place is at 488, so that's one more. So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last block. Each of these blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let me count the blocks: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. Now, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers? Wait, 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, in the tens place, 480-488 contributes 9 8's in the tens place. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 8's, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 8's. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n  \nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book only goes up to 488.\n  \nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full cycles of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then a partial cycle from 481 to 488. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the last full cycle would be 480-488. But wait, 488 is 488, so in the units place, 4 appears in 484, which is within the 480-489 range. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's once every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, that's 48 full tens (1-480) plus the 484. So that's 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so that's 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. But then, in the 481-488 range, 484 is within this, so that's an additional 1, making it 49. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. So, numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within the range, but 480-489 would have 480-488, but the tens digit is 8 there, not 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see: 40-49: 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, so 50 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. So, numbers from 400-488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, hundreds place: 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4's appear 188 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, but now looking for 8's. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, and then the partial cycle from 481-488, which includes 488. So, in each full cycle, 8 appears once, so 48 times. Then, in the partial cycle, 488 is included, so that's an additional 1, making it 49 times. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking for 8 in the tens place. So, numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is within the book's pages. So, let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480 is the first, 488 is the last, so that's 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times. So, tens place: 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, looking for 8 in the hundreds place. But the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " Let me see, from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place. Since every 10 numbers have exactly one 4 in the units place, I can calculate it as follows: The total number of such numbers is the total number of pages divided by 10, but I need to make sure it doesn't exceed 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, the 49th group would be from 480 to 488, and 484 is within this group. So, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but the integer part is 48, but since 480 to 488 is the 49th group, I think it's 49. Let me check: from 1 to 480, that's 480 pages, so 480/10 = 48, and then from 481 to 488, which is 8 pages, and 484 is one of them, so that's one more. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 480 is the 48th group, so 480 is included, but 480 is 480, which is 4 in the hundreds place, 8 in the tens, and 0 in the units. So, in the units place, up to 480, we have 48 occurrences, and then 484 adds one more, making it 49. So, units place: 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 1-488, the ranges are: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's five ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but does 449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, tens place: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. Each number here has 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, hundreds place: 89. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, let me check that again. Units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems high, but let me think. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the units place. Let me recount the units place. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? Every 10 numbers, starting at 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. The number of such numbers is floor(488 / 10) = 48, but since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is less than 4, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49. That seems correct. Tens place: as above, 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 50. Hundreds place: 89. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, but let's check. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place? Every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and then 488 itself, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many ranges? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, but the last one, 480-488, has only 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 4 ranges with 10 numbers each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one range with 9 numbers (480-488). So, that's 4 x 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 is 49. So, tens place: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. Difference: 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, maybe that's correct, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I overcounted the hundreds place for 4's. Wait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 is correct. For the tens place of 4's, we have 5 ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each has 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50. Correct. Units place: 49. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. For 8's: units place 49, tens place 49, so 98. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but let me think about the tens place for 8's again. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 x 10 + 9 = 49. Correct. So, yes, 98 8's. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Occurs every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Occurs in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 5 ranges.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Occurs from 400 to 488.\n   - Total numbers: 89.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Occurs every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Occurs in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four ranges contribute 10 each, last range contributes 9.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, 484 is within 488, so that's fine. So, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? Well, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is the number of tens in 488. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so that's 48 full tens, but since 488 is the last page, the 48th ten would be up to 480, and then 481-488 would be the 49th ten, but the units place 4 would only be at 484. Wait, no, actually, each ten has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, there are 48 tens, each contributing one 4, so that's 48. Then, from 481 to 488, the next 4 in the units place would be 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, total 4's in units place: 49? Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full tens, and then one more in the 49th ten, making it 49. So, 49 4's in the units place. Wait, but wait, let me check. For example, from 1 to 10, 4 is once. From 11 to 20, 14 is once. So, each ten contributes one. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, and then one more in the 49th ten (481-490), but since we only go up to 488, 484 is the only one in that partial ten. So, total 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, how many such ranges are there? Let's see:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10\n- 240-249: 10\n- 340-349: 10\n- 440-449: 10\n\nBut wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, all 10 are included. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, yes, 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems right.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers.\n\nAgain, considering units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many 8's in the units place? From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 8. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, and then in the 49th ten (481-490), the 8 would be at 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. So, how many 8's in the tens place?\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488)\n\nWait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers? Wait, 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, each of the first four ranges contributes 10, and the last one contributes 9. So, total 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 80-89: 10 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place, so 10 8's. Similarly for 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: each contributes 10. Now, 480-488: the tens digit is 8, so numbers 480 to 488. But 480 is included, so 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers. So, 9 8's in the tens place for this range.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's. Let me recount:\n\n4's in units place: 49.\n\n4's in tens place: 50.\n\n4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\n8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total: 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's there.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, I think I correctly accounted for 480-488 as 9 numbers, contributing 9 8's in the tens place, making the total 49.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the units place for 4's. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, and then in the 49th ten (481-490), the 4 would be at 484. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, it's the same: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, and then 488 as the 49th. So, 49 8's in the units place.\n\nWait, but let me check: for 4's in the tens place, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each of those ranges is 10 numbers, so 5 ranges, 10 each, 50. That's correct.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nSo, 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to double-count or miss a range. Let me try a different approach to verify.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: floor(488/10) + (if the last digit is >=4, add 1). Wait, no, actually, for units digit, the number of 4's is equal to the number of complete groups of 10, plus 1 if the last number is >= the digit in the units place. So, floor(488/10) = 48, and since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\n- Tens place: For each ten's place, the number of times 4 appears is 10 times per hundred, except possibly the last one. So, for each hundred, from 0-99, 100-199, etc., the tens digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. How many hundreds do we have? From 0-488, that's 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so in the tens place, for 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0-8, so 4 appears once in the tens place (400-409, 410-419, etc., but wait, actually, the tens digit in 400-488 is 0-8, so 4 appears in 400-409, which is 10 numbers, but 400-409 is 10 numbers, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 400-409 is included, so that's 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Similarly, in 140-149, etc. So, the number of 4's in the tens place is 5 (each hundred contributes one 10) times 10, but wait, no, in each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9, so each hundred contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, for 0-488, there are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so the tens digit in 400-488 goes up to 8. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only once, in 400-409, which is 10 numbers. So, total 4's in the tens place: 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each contribute 10, so 4*10=40, and then 400-488 contributes another 10, so total 50. That matches my earlier count.\n\n- Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\n- Units place: floor(488/10)=48, and since 488 mod 10=8 >=8, so 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: For each hundred, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, in each hundred, 10 numbers where tens digit is 8. From 0-488, there are 5 hundreds. However, in the last hundred (400-488), the tens digit goes up to 8, so 480-489 would be the tens digit 8, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the first four hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributes 10 numbers where tens digit is 8, so 4*10=40. The last hundred (400-488) contributes 9 numbers where tens digit is 8 (480-488). So, total 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: No 8's in the hundreds place, as the book ends at 488. So, 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because I thought maybe I missed something. Let me try a different approach by actually writing out the counts for each digit position.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: Every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. That's 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, and then one more at 484, so 49.\n\n- Tens: In each hundred, 40-49,140-149, etc., each contributes 10. There are 5 such ranges (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449), each with 10, so 5*10=50.\n\n- Hundreds: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: Every 10 numbers, 8,18,28,...,488. That's 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full tens, and then one more at 488, so 49.\n\n- Tens: In each hundred, 80-89,180-189, etc., each contributes 10. There are 4 full hundreds (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. The last hundred (400-488) contributes 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. Total tens place 8's: 40+9=49.\n\n- Hundreds: None, as before.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me see, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4. Well, every 10 numbers, there's one such number. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so that would mean there are 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 48 times 10 is 480, so the next number is 481, and the last number is 488, which is beyond 480. So, the units digit 4 appears 48 times? Wait, no, because 480 + 4 is 484, which is within 488. So, actually, it's 48 times, right? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then 14, 24, ..., 484. The number of such numbers is floor(488 / 10) = 48. Because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, meaning there are 48 numbers ending with 4. So, 48 occurrences in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place (second digit):** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which is the second digit. This happens in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. The first is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 occurrences where the tens digit is 4. Wait, but let me check: from 0-99, 40-49 is 10 numbers. Then 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. 200-299: 240-249 is another 10. 300-399: 340-349 is another 10. 400-488: 440-449 is another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 50 times. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place (third digit):** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place, which is the third digit. This happens in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But in these numbers, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 occurrences where the hundreds digit is 4. Wait, but I'm only counting the digit 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times.\n\nNow, adding up the occurrences of 4 in each place: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, the digit 4 appears 187 times in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's count how many times this happens. The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, meaning 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so the last number is 488, which ends with 8. So, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is 49, because from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, we have 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: 8 is the first, then 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place (second digit):** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189 is another 10. 200-299: 280-289 is another 10. 300-399: 380-389 is another 10. Now, 400-488: The next would be 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, the range is 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the hundreds place 4, the tens digit 8 only appears 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 4 ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, plus the 9 in 480-488, totaling 49 occurrences in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me make sure. From 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189: 10. 200-299: 280-289: 10. 300-399: 380-389: 10. 400-488: 480-488: 9 numbers. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place (third digit):** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place in the range 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. Therefore, the hundreds digit 8 never appears. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up the occurrences of 8 in each place: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier I thought 4's were 187 and 8's were 98, so the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89. But let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. Number of terms: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. Wait, earlier I thought it was 48, but now I'm getting 49. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then 14, ..., up to 484. So, 484 is the last one. So, the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place for 4 is 49, not 48. So, I think I made a mistake earlier when I said 48. So, units place for 4 is 49, tens place is 50, hundreds place is 89. So total 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nWait, that's different from my initial count. So, I need to correct that. So, 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49 (as calculated earlier).\n\nTens place: 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo total 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 187, but that was incorrect because I miscalculated the units place for 4's. So, correct count is 188 4's and 98 8's, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me confirm again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1=48.8? Wait, 484-4=480, 480/10=48, so 48+1=49. So, 49.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each 10 numbers: 5*10=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). So, 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,...,488. Number of terms: ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference was 89, but now it's 90. So, I think I made a mistake in the initial calculation of 4's units place, which I corrected to 49, leading to 188 4's and 98 8's, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if 480-488 is correctly accounted for in the tens place for 8's. 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with tens digit 8, so that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 4's, the hundreds place is 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the 4's tens place again. 440-449 is 10 numbers, right? 440 to 449 inclusive is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 5 ranges each with 10 numbers, so 50.\n\nSimilarly, the units place for 4's is 49, as we have 484 as the last number, which is the 49th occurrence.\n\nSo, the total 4's are 188, 8's are 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the difference was 89, but now it's 90. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98.\n\n188-98=90.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in my initial solution, I thought the difference was 89, but that was because I miscalculated the units place for 4's as 48 instead of 49. So, the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check again.\n\nWait, 4's units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? Let's see, the sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 4 +10(n-1)=484. So, 10(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 terms.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's units place: 8,18,28,...,488. The nth term is 8 +10(n-1)=488. So, 10(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, n=49. So, 49 terms.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in the hundreds place, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me check the hundreds place for 4's again.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the hundreds place, there are none because the book only goes up to 488, so no page numbers are in the 800s. So, 0.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first thought about it, I thought the difference was 89, but now it's 90. So, I think the correct answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count any numbers or miss any ranges.\n\nWait, for 4's tens place, the ranges are 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nFor 8's tens place, the ranges are 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-488. The first four are 10 each, so 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked all the counts, and the difference is indeed 90.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Another way to approach this is to count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position separately.\n\nFor each position (units, tens, hundreds), count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nLet's do that:\n\n**Units place:**\n\n- Number of 4's: floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49.\n\n- Number of 8's: same as 4's, 49.\n\n**Tens place:**\n\n- Number of 4's: For each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. There are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). In each, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times, except in the last hundred where it's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 5*10=50.\n\n- Number of 8's: Similarly, in each hundred, the tens digit 8 occurs 10 times, except in the last hundred where it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\n**Hundreds place:**\n\n- Number of 4's: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\n- Number of 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188.\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something else. When counting the hundreds place for 4's, does 400-488 include 89 numbers? Let me confirm: 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place in 8's, 480-488 is 9 numbers, which is correct.\n\nSo, I think I can confidently say that there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit):** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). The number of such occurrences is calculated by dividing 488 by 10, which gives 48 full sets, but since 484 is included, it's 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit):** '4' appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges (including 440-449), totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit):** '4' appears in the range 400-488, which includes 89 numbers.\n\n   **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit):** The digit '8' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). This results in 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit):** '8' appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each range contributes 10 numbers, except the last range (480-488), which contributes 9. This totals 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit):** There are no page numbers in the 800s, so '8' does not appear here.\n\n   **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of '8's from the total number of '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8' in the page numbers of the book.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, 484 is 484, which is within 488. So, from 4 to 484, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? Let's see: the numbers are 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term is 4, the common difference is 10, and the last term is 484. The formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d. So, 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 4: 480 = (n-1)*10. Divide by 10: 48 = n-1. So, n = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. Wait, but wait, 484 is the 49th term. Let me check: 4 + (49-1)*10 = 4 + 48*10 = 4 + 480 = 484. Yes, correct. So, 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, but 540-549 would be beyond 488, so we don't have that. Let me count how many sets of ten there are where the tens digit is 4. Each such set has 10 numbers, except maybe the last one if it's cut off by 488. So, starting from 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. Wait, but wait, 440-449: 440 to 449 is 10 numbers, so yes, that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. That would be from 400 to 488. Wait, but the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's printed: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last page is 488, which ends with 8. So, the sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me find how many terms there are. Using the same arithmetic sequence formula: a_n = 8 + (n-1)*10. The last term is 488. So, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 8: 480 = (n-1)*10. Divide by 10: 48 = n-1. So, n = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. So, each full set (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers, but the last set, 480-488, has only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). Let me count how many full sets there are. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers. So, that's 4 full sets and one partial set. So, total 8's in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, yes, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed: 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that's 90. But wait, let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems. Let me verify the counts again. For 4's: Units place: 4,14,...,484. That's 484 - 4 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each is 10 numbers, 5 sets, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 488 - 400 +1 = 89. Correct. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. For 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 -8 = 480, /10=48, +1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None \u2192 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, it's 48 full sets of 10, which gives 48 fours. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 include another 4 in the units place? Wait, 488's units digit is 8, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484. So, from 1 to 484, how many 4's in the units place? Let's see: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms can be calculated by (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within 488, so yes, 49 times in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so maybe I should check if 484 is less than or equal to 488, which it is. So, 49 fours in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 fours. From 100-199: 140-149: another 10 fours. From 200-299: 240-249: another 10 fours. From 300-399: 340-349: another 10 fours. From 400-488: 440-449: here, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, 449 is within 488, so that's 10 fours. So, that's 10 fours per hundred, and there are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only part of the 400s, but 440-449 is fully within 400-488, so yes, 10 fours there. So, total fours in the tens place: 5 ranges \u00d7 10 fours = 50 fours. Wait, but wait, 400-488 is only up to 488, so does 440-449 fit? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but I'm only counting the hundreds place here, so yes, 89 fours. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Now, let me check if that's correct. Wait, 49 units, 50 tens, 89 hundreds. Yes, 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds place.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? Let's see: from 1 to 488, the last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many terms are there? The first term is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except possibly the last one if it's cut short. Let's check each:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, 10 eights.\n- 180-189: 10 numbers, 10 eights.\n- 280-289: 10 numbers, 10 eights.\n- 380-389: 10 numbers, 10 eights.\n- 480-488: Here, the range is from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, so that's 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nSo, total eights in the tens place: 4 ranges \u00d710 = 40, plus 9 from the last range, totaling 49 eights.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 units, 49 tens, so 98 eights. But let me double-check the tens place because I might have made a mistake there.\n\nWait, in the tens place, for 480-488, that's 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place, so 9 eights. So, yes, 40 from the first four hundreds (80s, 180s, 280s, 380s) and 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98 eights.\n\nWait, but let me check again: units place, 8,18,...,488. How many terms? From 8 to 488, step 10. So, the number of terms is ((488 -8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10\u00d74=40, plus 9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, total eights: 49+49=98.\n\nNow, total fours: 188, total eights:98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my counts again.\n\nWait, for fours:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal:49+50=99+89=188.\n\nEights:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal:98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check that again.\n\nIn the hundreds place, the numbers are from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but when I count the hundreds place, I'm only considering the hundreds digit, right? So, yes, 89 fours there.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for fours again. I had 50 fours in the tens place. Let me see:\n\n- 40-49:10\n- 140-149:10\n- 240-249:10\n- 340-349:10\n- 440-449:10\nThat's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours, so 5\u00d710=50. Correct.\n\nUnits place:49 fours.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nEights:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems a big difference. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I overcounted the fours in the hundreds place. Let me check: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. That's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the 480-488 range for eights in the tens place. From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers:480,481,...,488. Each has an 8 in the tens place, so 9 eights. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I count the units place for eights, I have 49. Let me check that: 8,18,...,488. So, 488 is included, so the count is (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nWait, so maybe the difference is indeed 90. Hmm.\n\nWait, but let me try a different approach to verify. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position again, but more carefully.\n\nLet's start with the units place.\n\n**Units place:**\n\nFor 4's: The numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The first term is 4, the last is 484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours.\n\nFor 8's: The numbers are 8,18,28,...,488. The first term is 8, last is 488. Number of terms: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights.\n\nSo, units place: 49 fours, 49 eights. So, equal so far.\n\n**Tens place:**\n\nFor 4's: The ranges are 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each contributes 10 fours. So, 5 ranges \u00d710=50 fours.\n\nFor 8's: The ranges are 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 eights each, and the last range (480-488) contributes 9 eights. So, 4\u00d710 +9=49 eights.\n\nSo, tens place: 50 fours, 49 eights. So, fours have 1 more here.\n\n**Hundreds place:**\n\nFor 4's: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nFor 8's: 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so no eights in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights.\n\nSo, hundreds place:89 fours, 0 eights.\n\nNow, adding up:\n\nFours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) =49+50=99+89=188.\n\nEights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, so I think that's correct. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made any mistake in the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. Correct.\n\nAnd for eights, since the book ends at 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s, so 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place (Ones Place):** The digit '4' appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '4' appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each range contributes 10 '4's, totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\n   **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '8' appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '8' appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. Each of the first four ranges contributes 10 '8's, and the last range contributes 9 '8's, totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers in the 800s, so '8' does not appear in the hundreds place.\n\n   **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of '8's from the total number of '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, let me see: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Well, every 10 numbers, there's exactly one such number. So, from 1 to 480, there are 480/10 = 48 numbers ending with 4. Then, 484 is the next, which is 481st occurrence? Wait, no, actually, 488 is the last page, so 484 is within that. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then from 481 to 488, we have 484 as the 49th occurrence. So, total 49 times 4 appears in the units place. Wait, no, let me check: 4,14,24,...,484. The last number ending with 4 before 488 is 484. So, how many terms are there? The sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The nth term can be expressed as 10n - 6. Wait, maybe a better approach is to calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place. Since every 10 numbers have one 4, the number of 4's in the units place is the number of complete tens. From 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. The number of complete tens is 48 (since 48*10=480), and then from 481 to 488, that's 8 more numbers. So, in the units place, each complete ten contributes one 4, so 48 times. Plus, in the last partial ten (481-488), does 484 have a 4 in the units place? Yes, so that's one more. So total 48 +1=49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: from 1-99, the block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 1-488? 440-449 is pages 440 to 449, which is within 488, so yes. So that's five blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 *10=50 times 4 appears in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: from 40-49: 10 numbers, 40-49. Then 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, 440-449: another 10. That's 5 blocks, each with 10, so 50. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4, which occurs from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Wait, but wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +50 +89= 188. Now, let me check that again: units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers:8,18,28,...,488. Let's count how many times. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then in the last partial ten (481-488), we have 488, which ends with 8. So, 48 +1=49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 numbers. How many such blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's four blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 4*10=40 times 8 appears in the tens place. Wait, but wait, 80-89 is within 1-99, 180-189 within 100-199, 280-289 within 200-299, 380-389 within 300-399. So, four blocks, 40 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds:49 +40 +0=89. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's:188 -89=99. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=40, hundreds=0. Total=89. Difference=188-89=99. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. For 8's, the hundreds place doesn't contribute because 800 is beyond 488. So, yes, 89 8's. So, the difference is 188-89=99. Therefore, there are 99 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 40 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 40 + 0 = 89\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 89 (8's) = 99\n\n\\boxed{99}"

    "text": " Let me see, from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place. The pattern repeats every 10 numbers, so the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but actually, the last number with 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 48th occurrence because 484 is 48*10 + 4. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one block. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 blocks * 10 = 50 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. Each number here has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times. Now, adding up the number of 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 4's appear 187 times. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that is. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, 488 is the last page, which is 488, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's 49 times? Wait, let me check. From 1 to 488, the numbers ending with 8 are 8,18,28,...,488. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488. Let's solve for n: (n-1)*10 \u2264 480 \u2192 n-1 \u2264 48 \u2192 n \u2264 49. So, there are 49 numbers ending with 8. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. This occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count these blocks. From 0-99: 80-89 is one block (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 is another (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 is another (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 is another (10 numbers). Now, from 400-488: 480-489 would be the next block, but since the book ends at 488, the block is only 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 numbers, so that's 4*10=40. Then, the last partial block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up the number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought 4's appeared 187 times, which is way more than 98. But let me double-check. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the 8's in the tens place. Let me recount. The blocks for tens place 8 are: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers). So that's 4 full blocks and one partial. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, yes, 49 times. So, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. So, number of 4's is 187, number of 8's is 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems. Let me verify the 4's again: units place: 4,14,...,484. That's 48 numbers (since 484 is 48*10 +4, so 48 times). Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 48+50+89=187. Correct. Now, 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers because 488 is the 49th term. Tens place: 80-89 (10),180-189 (10),280-289 (10),380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10=40 +9=49. So, 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly for 4's? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488-400+1=89. Yes, that's correct. So, 89 numbers with 4 in the hundreds place. So, 4's total 187, 8's total 98. The difference is 89. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Let me see, from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place. Since every 10 numbers have exactly one 4 in the units place, the total number of 4's in the units place would be the total number of such groups. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, the units digit cycles 48 times completely, each giving one 4, so 48 times. But wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, the next is 14, 24, ..., 484. The number of terms can be calculated by (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that's 49 times. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake earlier. Because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but the number of times the units digit cycles is actually the number of complete decades plus one if the remainder is greater than or equal to the digit. Wait, maybe a better way is to compute it as floor((488 + 1) / 10) = floor(489 / 10) = 48.9, so 48 times? No, that doesn't seem right because 488 is the upper limit. Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as for each position, the number of times a digit appears is calculated by the formula where you take the higher digits and the lower digits. Let me recall the formula for counting digit occurrences. For a specific digit d in a specific position (units, tens, hundreds), the count is calculated as follows:\n\n- Let's say we're looking at the units place. The number of times d appears in the units place from 1 to n is given by:\n  - high = n // 10\n  - low = n % 10\n  - if d < low: count = high * 10\n  - if d == low: count = high * 10 + (low - d + 1)\n  - if d > low: count = (high + 1) * 10\n\nWait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me think again. For the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each block of 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete blocks of 10, which is 48, plus any extra numbers in the last partial block where the units digit is 4. Since 488 is the last page, the last block is 480-488. In this block, the numbers ending with 4 are 484. So, that's one more. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 4's in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such blocks there are. The hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. Wait, but page numbers start at 1, so the first block is 40-49 (hundreds digit 0, but page numbers are 40-49, which are two-digit numbers). Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449? Since the book has 488 pages, 449 is less than 488, so yes, that block is fully included. So, 5 blocks * 10 = 50 times. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how about the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but wait a second, 400-488 is 89 numbers, but the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, right? So, yes, 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate that. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** How many times does 8 appear in the units place from 1 to 488? Using the same logic as with 4's. Each block of 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. So, number of complete blocks is 48 (since 488//10=48). The last partial block is 480-488, which includes 488, so the units digits go from 0 to 8. So, 8 appears once in this block (488). So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 8's in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's count the number of blocks. The hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, 0: 80-89 (10 numbers), 1:180-189 (10), 2:280-289 (10), 3:380-389 (10), and 4:480-488. Now, the last block, 480-488, has numbers where the tens digit is 8, but how many numbers are there? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, the first four blocks (0-3) each contribute 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last block contributes 9 numbers, so 40 + 9 = 49 times. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but wait, let me make sure. For the tens place, the number of times 8 appears is calculated as follows:\n\n- For each hundred block (0-99, 100-199, etc.), the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89). There are 5 hundred blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). But in the last block, 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, for the first four blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. The last block contributes 9, so total 40 + 9 = 49. So, yes, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how about the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Units place: 49, tens place:49, hundreds:0, so 49+49=98. So, 98 8's.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. Let me go through each digit position again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal:49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal:49+49=98. That seems correct.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I counted the tens place for 4's, I got 50, but for 8's, I got 49. Let me see why that is. For 4's in the tens place, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks each have 10 numbers, but the last block (480-488) has only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 4*10 +9=49. That's correct.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 188-98=90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 times (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 times (e.g., 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 times (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 times.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me see, from 0 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place. Well, every 10 numbers, there's one such number. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, it's 48 times. Wait, but starting from page 1, the first 4 in the units place is page 4, and the last one before 488 is 484. So, that's 48 times? Let me check: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms can be calculated by (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Oh, so it's 49 times. I think I made a mistake earlier by dividing 488 by 10, which gave 48.8, but the correct way is to consider the first and last occurrence and calculate the number of terms. So, 49 times for the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This would be numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many numbers that is. Each set of ten numbers (like 40-49) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such sets are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one set, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another set, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. Let me count how many sets: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, 50 times for the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This would be numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? Well, from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times.\n\nNow, adding up the number of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's count how many times. The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. So, number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place would be numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many sets there are. From 0-99: 80-89 is one set (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 is another set (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). Now, 400-488: The next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of this. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 480 +1 = 9 numbers. So, in the hundreds place of 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, for the tens place, we have four full sets (each 10 numbers) from 0-399, and then a partial set from 400-488. So, that's 4 \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9, totaling 49 times.\n\nWait, no, let me correct that. Because in the tens place, 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contribute 10 numbers, but in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 occurs only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, the number of times 8 appears in the tens place is: from 0-399, there are 4 sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, from 400-488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nNow, adding up the number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 0-99: 80-89 (10), 100-199: 180-189 (10), 200-299: 280-289 (10), 300-399: 380-389 (10), and 400-488: 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier for 4's, I had 188. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But wait, let me check again because sometimes when counting, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nWait, for 4's in the hundreds place, I counted 89 times, right? Because from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. Let me confirm: 488 - 400 +1 = 89. Yes, that's correct.\n\nFor 4's in the tens place, I had 5 sets: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 4,14,...,484. That's 49 numbers, as calculated earlier.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 +89=188. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers.\n\nTens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. That's 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be different. Let me check again, maybe I made a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. Wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's correct. So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. So, yes, 49.\n\nWait, but another way to calculate the number of 8's in the tens place: The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. So, in each hundred, the 8 in the tens place occurs 10 times (e.g., 80-89). So, from 0-488, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399. Each contributes 10, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total 40+9=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the units place, 8's: same calculation, 49.\n\nSo, 49+49=98.\n\nThus, 4's:188, 8's:98, difference:90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because I thought the answer might be 90, but I want to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position separately.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: As calculated, 49.\n- Tens place: 50.\n- Hundreds place:89.\nTotal: 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place:49.\n- Tens place:49.\n- Hundreds place:0.\nTotal:98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - Pages: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Pages: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such sets.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Pages: 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Pages: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Pages: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four sets contributes 10 numbers, and the last set contributes 9.\n   - Total: (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Pages: None, as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Let me calculate how many times this happens. The formula for the number of times a digit appears in the units place is to take the total number of pages, divide by 10, and then if the digit is in the units place, add 1 if the remainder is greater than or equal to the digit. Wait, maybe a better way is to consider how many complete groups of 10 there are, and then see if there's a partial group. From 1 to 488, the number of complete groups of 10 is 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8). So, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times in the units place. But wait, actually, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so the number of times each digit appears in the units place is 48 times for digits 0-9, but since we start from 1, maybe it's a bit different. Wait, no, because in each group of 10, each digit from 0-9 appears once in the units place. So, for 488 pages, there are 48 full groups of 10 (since 48\u00d710=480) and then 8 more pages (481-488). So, in the units place, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times, and then in the remaining 8 pages, the units digits are 1-8. So, the digit 4 appears 48 times in the units place, and the digit 8 appears 48 times plus 1 more in the remaining pages (since 488 has an 8 in the units place). Wait, no, because the remaining pages are 481-488, so the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, digit 8 appears once more in the units place. So, total units place: 4's = 48, 8's = 48 +1 =49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, in the tens place, 4 appears as 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each time, the tens digit is 4 for 10 consecutive numbers. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see. From 1 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, that's 5 ranges \u00d710 =50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 4 appears 50 times in the tens place. Now, for 8's in the tens place: the ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 times, so that's 4\u00d710=40. Then, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers (480-488), so that's 9 times. So total 40+9=49 times. So, 8's in the tens place:49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). Wait, no, 488-400=88, so 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, for 8's in the hundreds place: pages 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 8's in the hundreds place:0. Now, let's sum up the total number of 4's and 8's. Total 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. Total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, the difference is 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. Wait, that can't be right because when I added up the 4's, I got 187, and the 8's were 98, so 187-98=89. But wait, let me double-check my calculations. Units place for 4's:48, tens:50, hundreds:89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, but I feel like I might have made a mistake in the units place for 8's. Let me check that again. Units place: from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear? Each group of 10 has one 8 in the units place, so 48 groups give 48 eights, and then in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so one more 8. So, 48+1=49. That seems correct. Tens place: for 8's, as I calculated, 49 times. So, total 8's:49+49=98. And 4's:187. So, 187-98=89. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer would be different. Let me check the hundreds place again. For 4's, hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 pages. That's correct because 488-400+1=89. For 8's, hundreds digit never appears because the book ends at 488, so no 800-899 pages. So, 0 for hundreds place for 8's. Now, let me check the tens place again for 4's. From 40-49:10 numbers, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. Correct. For 8's in the tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4\u00d710=40 plus 9=49. Correct. Units place for 4's:48 times. Units place for 8's:49 times. So, total 4's:48+50+89=187. Total 8's:49+49=98. Difference:187-98=89. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - Each group of 10 pages (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) has one 4 in the units place.  \n   - There are 48 complete groups of 10 in 480 pages, contributing 48 fours.  \n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) include one more 4 (484).  \n   - **Total 4's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - The tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.  \n   - Each range contributes 10 fours, totaling 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.  \n   - **Total 4's in tens place:** 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place.  \n   - This is 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1).  \n   - **Total 4's in hundreds place:** 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - Similar to 4's, each group of 10 pages has one 8 in the units place, contributing 48 eights.  \n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) include one more 8 (488).  \n   - **Total 8's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.  \n   - Each of the first four ranges contributes 10 eights, totaling 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.  \n   - The range 480-488 contributes 9 eights (480-488).  \n   - **Total 8's in tens place:** 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - No pages in the book have 8 in the hundreds place.  \n   - **Total 8's in hundreds place:** 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me see, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4. Well, the sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. To find how many terms there are, I can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: n = ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. Here, the first term is 4, the last term is 484, and the common difference is 10. So, n = ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1 to 488, the tens digit 4 appears in the following ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. But wait, let me check: 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10. So, 5*10=50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4, which occurs in the pages 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). Wait, but I'm only concerned with the hundreds digit being 4, which is true for all these numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, let me sum up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, total 4's printed are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first term is 8, the last term is 488. So, n = ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Let me count each range. - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. Wait, that can't be right because 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 only for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the 8 in the tens place occurs 4 times with 10 numbers each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), and once with 9 numbers (480-488). So, total 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, summing up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total 8's printed are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such occurrences.\n   \n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in all page numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).

    "text": " Let me calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place. The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term a1 = 4, the common difference d = 10, and the last term an = 484. The formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is an = a1 + (n-1)d. Plugging in the values: 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 4 from both sides: 480 = (n-1)*10. Divide both sides by 10: 48 = n-1. So, n = 49. So, there are 49 instances where 4 appears in the units place. Wait, but does 484 count as a valid page number? Yes, because 484 is less than 488. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid, but 480-489 isn't fully included because the book ends at 488. So, let's break it down. - From 40-49: that's 10 numbers, so 10 times 4 in the tens place. - From 140-149: another 10 numbers, so another 10 times. - From 240-249: another 10. - From 340-349: another 10. - From 440-449: another 10. Now, from 480-488: the tens digit is 8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So, total for tens place is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50 times. Wait, but let me check. The first set is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then each subsequent hundred adds another 10. So, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. Correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. Wait, but 400-488 includes numbers where the hundreds digit is 4, so yes, 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Using the same arithmetic sequence approach: a1=8, d=10, an=488. Using an = a1 + (n-1)d: 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 8: 480 = (n-1)*10. Divide by 10: 48 = n-1. So, n=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each set. - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 times. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: here, the tens digit is 8, and the numbers go from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 times. So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times. Adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484), totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488), totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last range 480-488 contributing 9 times, totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me see, from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place. The pattern repeats every 10 numbers, so in 488 numbers, there are 488 / 10 = 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That would be 48 times. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups, and then an extra 8 numbers. So, the 48th group ends at 480, and then from 481 to 488, we have 484 as the next number with a 4 in the units place. So that's 49 times in the units place. Wait, no, because 480 is the 48th multiple of 10, so from 1 to 480, there are 48 numbers with 4 in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, 484 is the next one, so that's 49 in total. Hmm, maybe I should think differently. Alternatively, the number of 4's in the units place can be calculated as the number of times 4 appears in each 10-number block. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then in the last partial block (481-488), we have 484, which is one more 4. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 4's in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, let's look at the tens place. The digit 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 sets of 10 numbers each, totaling 5*10 = 50 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The digit 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these numbers has a 4, so that's 89 times. Wait, but I think that's incorrect because the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place separately.\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), we have 488, which is an 8 in the units place. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let me check each range:\n\n- From 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers.\n- From 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers.\n- From 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers.\n- From 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers.\n- From 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 how many numbers? 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. For the tens place in 400-488, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, total 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each step again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49. That seems correct because from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place, and the last one is 484, so 49 times.\n\n- Tens place: 5 sets of 10 numbers (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). Each contributes 10, so 5*10=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49. Because from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place, and the last one is 488, so 49.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. That's correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place in 4's, I had 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's, in the tens place, I had 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nUnits place for both 4 and 8: 49 each. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Let me see, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4. Since every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place, the total number would be the number of complete groups of 10 in 488, which is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the last number ending with 4 is 484, which is 48th occurrence because 484 is 48*10 + 4. So, 48 times. Hmm, but wait, let me check: 10*48 = 480, so 480 + 4 = 484, which is correct. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? Let's see: from 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, in each hundred, there's a block where the tens digit is 4. But wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit goes up to 4, so 440-449 is a full block, but 450-488 would have tens digits from 5 to 8, so no more 4's in the tens place beyond 449. So, how many complete hundreds have a 4 in the tens place? From 0-99: 40-49, that's one block. From 100-199: 140-149, another block. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, and 300-399: 340-349. Then, 400-488: 440-449. So, that's five blocks in total. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks * 10 = 50 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. This happens from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 occurrences. So, total number of 4's is units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. Wait, 48+50=98, plus 89 is indeed 187. Now, let me check if I missed anything. Hmm, maybe I should double-check the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Yes, each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll go through the same process: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups. The last number ending with 8 before 488 is 488 itself, which ends with 8. So, that's 49 numbers because 488 is included. Wait, let me think: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, ..., 488. So, how many terms? It's the number of times 8 appears in the units place. Since 488 is the last page, and 488 ends with 8, so the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 can appear in the tens place. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but in 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 0-99: 80-89, that's one block (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189, another block (10 numbers). 200-299: 280-289, another block (10 numbers). 300-399: 380-389, another block (10 numbers). 400-488: 480-488. Now, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but how many numbers are there? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 10 times in each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.), and 9 times in the last block (480-488). So, total in tens place: 4 blocks *10 = 40, plus 9 in the last block, total 49. Wait, but let me think again. The 480-488 range is part of the 400-488 pages. So, in the tens place, 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 40 (from the first four blocks) +9=49. Wait, but wait, 80-89 is 10 numbers, same for 180-189, etc., so 4 blocks *10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The book has 488 pages, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. 8 would only appear in the hundreds place if the book had, say, 800 pages or more. Since it's 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 187, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, let me check that subtraction: 187 - 98. 187 - 90 = 97, then minus 8 more is 89. Yes, that's correct. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers. Hmm, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=48+50=98+89=187. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. Difference=187-98=89. Seems correct. Wait, but earlier when counting the tens place for 4's, I thought it was 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Let me confirm that. From 0-99: 40-49, that's 10 numbers. 100-199:140-149, another 10. 200-299:240-249, another 10. 300-399:340-349, another 10. 400-488:440-449, another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. For 8's in the tens place, it's 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each with 10 numbers, so 40, plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49. Correct. Units place for 4's: 48 numbers, and for 8's: 49 numbers. Wait, why is 8's units place 49 and 4's units place 48? Because 488 is included, which is an 8 in the units place, so that adds one more. So, 488 is the 49th occurrence of 8 in the units place, but for 4's, the last occurrence in the units place is 484, which is 48 times. So, that's correct. Similarly, in the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times, while 8's don't appear at all in the hundreds place. So, the counts seem accurate. Therefore, the final answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).

There are 5 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488). There are 4 full blocks (40 occurrences) plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book has 488 pages.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Let me calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place. Since the book has 488 pages, the units digit cycles every 10 pages. So, from 1 to 488, there are 488 / 10 = 48 full cycles, which gives 48 occurrences. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so actually, it's 48 full cycles (1-480) and then 8 extra pages (481-488). In each full cycle, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (484). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one block, so 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another block, another 10 numbers. Similarly, from 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So, how many blocks is that? From 1-400, that's four blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), each contributing 10 numbers, so 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, from 400-488, the next block would be 440-449, which is another 10 numbers, so that's 5 blocks total, giving 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, the tens place 4's: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's printed: 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's count how many times. From 1 to 488, how many full decades are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles. Each cycle contributes one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once more (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers: 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let me count how many such blocks. From 1-99: 80-89 is one block, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, but does 480-488 count as a full block? Let me see: 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, each block before 400 contributes 10, and the last one contributes 9. So, number of blocks: 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 10 each, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, the last block from 480-488 contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through the 4's again. Units place: 48 full cycles (1-480) with 4 in units, so 48, plus 484, so 49. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct. Now for the 8's: Units place: 48 full cycles (1-480) with 8 in units, so 48, plus 488, so 49. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks are 10 each, so 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but when I think about it, 4's in the hundreds place are from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. But 8's in the tens place from 480-488 is 9, not 10, because 488 is the last page. So, that's correct. So, the difference is 90. Hmm, that seems right. So, I think the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (4, 14, ..., 484)\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449)\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488)\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (8, 18, ..., 488)\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488)\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 488 is the last page. Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4. However, the 48th group ends at 480, and then we have 481-488. In 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is indeed 48. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in 1-99, 40-49 is one block, which is 10 numbers. Then, in 100-199, 140-149 is another block, another 10. Similarly, 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. Wait, but let me check: 440-449 is 10 numbers, and 440 is page 440, which is within 488, so yes, that's included. So, 5 blocks, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers, so each contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's. Now, let me add up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's printed: 187. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's calculate how many times 8 appears in the units place. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, in the last partial group, 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once more. So, total 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such blocks are within 488. 400-488 includes 400-488, but the next block after 380-389 would be 480-489, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is part of that block. So, how many blocks? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers). Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so each contributes one 8 in the tens place. So, that's 5 blocks: 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 8's, and the fifth block is 480-488, contributing 9 8's. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9. So yes, 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 89.

    "text": " Let me see, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4. Well, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one number ending with 4. So, total blocks of 10 in 488 pages are 48 full blocks (1-480) and then 8 more pages (481-488). So, 48 blocks * 1 = 48, and in the last 8 pages, 484 is the only one ending with 4. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times 4 appears in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is included. Hmm, yeah, that seems right. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which would be numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one block, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. But wait, 440-449 is only 10 numbers, right? So, yes, 5 blocks each with 10 numbers. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place, which would be numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times.

I'll go through each digit position again: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me count how many such numbers there are. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? Well, every block of 10 has one such number. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks and then 8 more pages. So, in the full blocks, 48 numbers, and in the last 8 pages (481-488), the number 488 ends with 8. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-99: 80-89, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 is the last page. So, in the hundreds place 4, the tens place 8 would be from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, how does that affect the count? Let me think. So, normally, each block before 400 has 10 numbers, but the last block (480-488) has only 9. So, total for tens place: 4 blocks with 10 numbers each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 4*10 = 40, and the last block 480-488 contributes 9. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. 8 in the hundreds place would be 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the number of 8's in each position: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in every 10th number, resulting in 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in every 10th number, resulting in 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n   \nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place. The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The difference between each term is 10, so the number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but 484 is the 49th term? Let me check: 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484, so 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. Yeah, that's correct. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so we don't have 480-489. Let me calculate how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each set of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place, except maybe the last set if it's cut short. From 1-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. From 200-299: 240-249 is 10. From 300-399: 340-349 is 10. From 400-488: 440-449 is 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So, that's 10 per hundred, and we have 4 hundreds (1-400, 400-800, but wait, the book is only up to 488, so actually, the hundreds are 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488). Wait, so from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 10 (from 40-49) + 10 (140-149) + 10 (240-249) + 10 (340-349) + 10 (440-449) = 50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times 8 appears in the units place. The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The last term is 488, which is 8 more than 480, so 480 +8=488. So, the number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 =48 +1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such sets we have. From 1-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is 10. From 200-299: 280-289 is 10. From 300-399: 380-389 is 10. From 400-488: 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, so in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, total tens place 8's: 10 (80-89) +10 (180-189)+10 (280-289)+10 (380-389)+9 (480-488) = 10+10+10+10+9=49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) -98 (number of 8's)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484) \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in sequences like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488) \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in sequences like 80-89, 180-189, etc., but only 480-488 in the last set \u2192 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are \\boxed{90} more 4's printed than 8's."

    "text": " Wait, 484 is within 488, so yes. So, from 4 to 484, that's how many numbers? Let's see, from 4 to 484 in steps of 10. The count would be ((484 - 4)/10) + 1. Let me compute that: (480)/10 = 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, for 10 consecutive numbers each time. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many sets of 10 are there? Let's see: 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. Therefore, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the counts for 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is included, so let's see. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, the first number is 8, the last is 488. The count is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, for 10 consecutive numbers each time. So, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but 480-489 would go up to 489, but the book only goes up to 488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10. Let me check: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers. So, how many sets? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the counts for 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's.

    "text": " Let me calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is the number of complete groups of 10. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, that means there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4. So, 48 times. But wait, does 488 include an extra 4 in the units place? Let's check: 480 is the last multiple of 10 before 488, so 480 + 8 = 488. So, 488 doesn't have a 4 in the units place, so the count remains 48. Wait, but 488 is 488, so the units digit is 8, so no, the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit can be 4. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 1 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, there's a block where the tens digit is 4, contributing 10 numbers. How many hundreds are there? 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So, the hundreds are 1, 2, 3, and 4. For each hundred, except maybe the last one, there's a 40-49 block. So, for hundreds 1, 2, 3, and 4, each has a 40-49 block, except that for the last hundred (400-488), the 440-449 block is entirely within 400-488, right? So, each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would contribute 4 * 10 = 40. Wait, but does the 440-449 block fall entirely within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 40 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. That's the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. Let me calculate that. 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 40 = 88; 88 + 89 = 177. So, 177 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll go through the same process: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many times? From 1 to 488, each 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups, contributing 48 8's. But wait, 488 is included, and its units digit is 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times. Let me check: The first 8 is at 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms in this sequence can be calculated as (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last one, 480-488, which only has 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488). So, let's count: The first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 8's in the tens place. That's 4 * 10 = 40. The last range is 480-488, which has 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 177 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 79. Wait, that can't be right because 177 - 98 is 79. Hmm, let me double-check my calculations because that seems a bit high, but maybe it's correct. Let me go through each step again. For 4's: Units: 48, Tens: 40, Hundreds: 89. 48 + 40 = 88; 88 + 89 = 177. That seems correct. For 8's: Units: 49, Tens: 49, Hundreds: 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 177 - 98 = 79. Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check again. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges contributes 10 numbers, so 4 * 10 = 40. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers, so 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct. So, 49 in tens place. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so total 98. So, 177 - 98 = 79. Hmm, that seems correct.

So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Using the same arithmetic sequence formula: a1=8, d=10, a_n=488. So, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 8: 480 = (n-1)*10. Divide by 10: 48 = n-1. So, n=49. So, 49 occurrences of 8 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's count each range. From 1-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is 10. From 200-299: 280-289 is 10. From 300-399: 380-389 is 10. From 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). Wait, no: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, that's 9. So, total in tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 numbers here.\n  \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This sequence has 49 terms.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me see, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4. Well, every 10 numbers, there's one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, that's 480/10 = 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, there's 484, which is one more. So, total 49 times in the units place. Wait, is that right? Let me check. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490), but 490 is beyond 488, so actually, it's 48 times in the units place, plus the 484, which is within 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100, specifically in the tens digit. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks each contributing 10 4's. So, 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through each digit position again. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's count how many times. From 1 to 488, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is the number of complete groups of 10. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 ends with an 8, so that's the 48th group plus one more? Wait, no. Let me think. Each group of 10 has one 8 in the units place. So, from 1-10: 8, 11-20: 18, etc. The number of 8's in the units place is the number of times 8 appears in each group. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and then 8 more numbers (481-488), which includes 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, that's correct. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 block, but since the book only goes up to 488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, each of these blocks contributes 10 8's except the last one, which contributes 9. Let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total 8's in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me add that up: 10+10=20, +10=30, +10=40, +9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences (since the book ends at 488).\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me see: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4. So, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, total number of 4's in the units place would be the number of tens in 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 48*10 is 480, and the last number ending with 4 before 488 is 484, which is within the range. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is the last 4 in the units place, which is 48 times. Hmm, but let me check: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4. The first is 4, then 14, 24,..., 484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Oh, so it's 49 times. Because 484 is the 49th term. So, 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. So, numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one block, contributing 10 4's. From 100-199: 140-149 is another block, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 5*10=50. But wait, let me check: 40-49 is 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place, so 10. Similarly for each block. So, 5 blocks, 10 each, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400-488? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. So, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? Let's see: the last number ending with 8 before 488 is 488 itself. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 in the tens place. So, numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's count the blocks: From 1-99: 80-89 is one block, 10 8's. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: Wait, the next block would be 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 -480 +1=9 numbers. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 8's, but the last one contributes only 9. So, total 8's in the tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. Wait, but let me think again. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, 9 8's in the tens place here. The other blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 8 can only appear in the hundreds place if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=49+49=98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, that's correct. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit cycles every 10, so from 1 to 488, how many full tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 48 times 10 is 480, so from 1 to 480, there are 48 4's in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the next 4 in the units place would be 484, which is within 481-488. So that's one more. So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-99: 40-49, that's one block. From 100-199: 140-149, another block. From 200-299: 240-249, another block. From 300-399: 340-349, another block. From 400-488: 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another block. So that's 5 blocks in total. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 x 10 = 50. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these numbers has a 4, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, but wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. So, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 48 x 10 is 480, so from 1-480, 48 8's in the units place. Then, from 481-488, the next 8 in the units place is 488. So that's one more. So total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range. Let's count the blocks: From 1-99: 80-89, that's one block, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another block. From 200-299: 280-289, another block. From 300-399: 380-389, another block. From 400-488: 480-488. Now, how many 8's in the tens place in 480-488? The tens digit is 8 in 480-488, so that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. But wait, in the tens place, each number in 480-488 has an 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 8's. So, the blocks are: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So total 8's in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, checking the count of 4's: Units place: 49, correct because from 1-488, every 10 numbers has a 4 in the units place, and 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, plus one more at 484, so 49. Tens place: 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. 49 + 50 + 89 = 188, correct. Now, 8's: Units place: 49, same logic as 4's. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the last block contributes 9, so 10*4 + 9 = 49. Hundreds place: 0. So total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.
