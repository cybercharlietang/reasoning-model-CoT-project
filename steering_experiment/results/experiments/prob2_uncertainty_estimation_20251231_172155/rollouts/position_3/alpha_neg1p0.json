    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and do the same for the digit 8. Then, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place. For any range of numbers, the digits in the units place cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. In each complete set of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same for 8. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 times 1, which is 48, plus any additional 4's in the remaining 8 numbers. Since 488 is the last number, the remaining numbers are 481 to 488. Looking at the units digits here, 481 has 1, 482 has 2, up to 488, which has 8. So, there's a 4 in 484, which adds one more. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, for 8's in units place: 48 times 1 is 48, plus the remaining numbers. The last set ends at 488, which has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So, 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nNext, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers, with each digit from 0 to 9 appearing 10 times in the tens place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete hundreds are there? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more numbers (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (40-49, 140-149, etc.), so that's 10 times per hundred. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? From 401-409, the tens digit is 0, then 410-419 is 1, 420-429 is 2, and so on up to 480-488, which is 8. Wait, actually, in the remaining 88 numbers, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 for the numbers 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So, that's another 10 times. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place. In each complete hundred, 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4 * 10 = 40 times. In the remaining 88 numbers, the tens digit goes up to 8, so 480-488 has the tens digit as 8 for 480-488. Wait, but 480 is 4-8-0, so the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, for the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. So, the difference here is 50 - 49 = 1.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only present from page 100 onwards. So, from 1 to 99, there are no hundreds digits. From 100 onwards, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4, since the book has 488 pages. So, let's see how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. \n\nNumbers from 400 to 488 have 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place here because the book only goes up to 488. So, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is zero.\n\nSo, the difference in the hundreds place is 89 - 0 = 89.\n\nNow, let's sum up the differences from each place. Units place: 0, tens place: 1, hundreds place: 89. So, total difference is 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nStarting with units place: 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have a 4 in 484 and an 8 in 488. So, 48 +1=49 for 4's and 48 +1=49 for 8's. So, units place difference is 0. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: For 4's, each hundred contributes 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 4, that's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 +10=50 for 4's. For 8's, each hundred contributes 10, so 4*10=40. In the last partial hundred, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 +9=49 for 8's. So, the difference is 50-49=1. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 never appears. So, difference is 89. So, total difference is 0 +1 +89=90. Hmm, but wait, let me think again about the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. And since the book only goes up to 488, there's no 8 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I think about the tens place, I considered 480-488 as having 8 in the tens place. But 480 is 4-8-0, so the tens digit is 8, but the units digit is 0. So, 480 is included, and 488 is the last one. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 4's in the tens place, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nSo, adding up, the total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nWait, wait, that can't be right because I'm adding up the counts for each digit place, but actually, I should sum the total counts for 4's and 8's separately and then subtract.\n\nWait, let me correct that. So, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference per place was 0, 1, and 89, which adds up to 90. So, that's consistent.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the counts again because sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, each digit 0-9 appears equally in the units place, except possibly the last partial set.\n\nNumber of complete sets of 10: floor(488/10) = 48 sets, each contributing one 4 and one 8.\n\nRemaining numbers: 488 - (48*10) = 8 numbers: 481-488.\n\nIn these 8 numbers, units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488). So, total units 4's: 48 +1=49, units 8's:48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 and 10 where it's 8.\n\nNumber of complete hundreds: floor(488/100)=4, so 4 hundreds.\n\nEach contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, 4*10=40 for both 4's and 8's.\n\nNow, the remaining numbers: 488 - 400 = 88 numbers (401-488).\n\nIn these 88 numbers, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8, each for 10 numbers except the last one, which is 8 for 9 numbers (480-488).\n\nWait, 401-488 is 88 numbers, which is 8 full tens (40-49, etc.) but let me think differently.\n\nWait, 401-488 is 88 numbers, which can be broken down as:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0\n- 411-420: tens digit 1\n- 421-430: tens digit 2\n- 431-440: tens digit 3\n- 441-450: tens digit 4\n- 451-460: tens digit 5\n- 461-470: tens digit 6\n- 471-480: tens digit 7\n- 481-488: tens digit 8\n\nWait, but 401-410 is 10 numbers, 411-420 another 10, etc., up to 471-480, which is 10 numbers, and then 481-488 is 8 numbers. So, in the tens place, for 4's, we have 441-450, which is 10 numbers. So, 4's in tens place: 10.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, we have 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so tens digit 8 appears 8 times? Wait, no, 481-488 is 8 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? So, 8 numbers with tens digit 8.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 9 numbers, but 488 - 480 = 8, so 480 is included, making it 9 numbers. Wait, 480 is part of the remaining 88 numbers, right? Because 401-488 includes 480.\n\nWait, 401-488 is 88 numbers. Let me check: 488 - 401 +1 = 88. So, 480 is 480, which is 480 - 401 +1 = 80th number? Wait, no, 401 is the first, so 401 is 1, 402 is 2, ..., 480 is 80, and 481 is 81, up to 488, which is 88. So, 480 is included, so from 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in the remaining 88 numbers.\n\nSo, total 8's in tens place: 4*10=40 (from complete hundreds) +9=49.\n\nSimilarly, 4's in tens place: 4*10=40 +10=50, because 440-449 is 10 numbers. So, correct.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nNumbers from 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. That's 488 - 400 +1=89 numbers. So, 89 4's in hundreds place.\n\n8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so hundreds digit can't be 8. So, 0 8's in hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference per place was 0,1,89, which adds up to 90. So, that's consistent.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. By analyzing each digit place (units, tens, and hundreds), we determine that 4 appears 188 times and 8 appears 98 times. The difference is 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with one-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digits that matter are 4 and 8. So, how many 4's are there? Well, only page 4 has a 4. Similarly, only page 8 has an 8. So, in the one-digit numbers, there's 1 four and 1 eight. That means the count so far is 4:1, 8:1.\n\nNext, I'll move on to two-digit page numbers, which range from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I think I should calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place separately.\n\nStarting with the tens place: For the tens digit, 4 appears in the numbers 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 fours. Similarly, 8 appears in 80-89, another 10 numbers, so 10 eights. \n\nNow, for the units place: In the units digit, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly once every 10 numbers. So, for two-digit numbers, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see, from 10 to 99, that's 90 numbers. So, 90 divided by 10 is 9. So, 4 appears 9 times in the units place. Similarly, 8 appears 9 times in the units place. \n\nWait, but hold on. When considering the two-digit numbers, the units place for 4 would be 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, right? Similarly for 8, it's 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. Also 9 numbers. So, that checks out.\n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19. Similarly, for 8's, it's 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19. Hmm, so so far, the counts are 4:1 (from one-digit) +19 =20, and 8:1+19=20. So, they are equal so far.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me double-check. For the tens place, 40-49 is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. For the units place, 4 appears once every 10 numbers, so from 10 to 99, that's 9 times. So, 10 +9=19 fours. Similarly for 8's, 10 (tens) +9 (units)=19. So, that seems correct. So, up to page 99, both 4's and 8's have been printed 20 times each.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which go from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because each page number now has a hundreds place, a tens place, and a units place. I think I should break this down into hundreds, tens, and units separately for both 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, for the hundreds place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, only in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1=89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place: For three-digit numbers, the tens digit can be from 0-9. I need to find how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place across all three-digit page numbers.\n\nFirst, let's consider 4 in the tens place. The tens digit is 4, so the numbers would be from 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so 4 ranges x10=40 fours. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so for the last range, 440-449, that's fine because 449 is less than 488. So, 40 fours in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place, the numbers would be 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers instead of 10. So, for each of the first three ranges (180-189, etc.), there are 10 numbers, so 3x10=30, plus 9 numbers in 480-488. So, total of 39 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me make sure. From 100-488, the tens digit cycles 0-9 for each hundred. So, for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nSo, for each hundred except the last one, the tens digit 4 and 8 each appear 10 times. So, for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, that's three hundreds, each contributing 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, 3x10=30 fours and 3x10=30 eights.\n\nNow, for the last hundred, 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for the tens digit 4, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 fours.\n\nFor the tens digit 8, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, 9 eights.\n\nSo, total fours in the tens place: 30 (from first three hundreds) +10=40. Eights in the tens place: 30 +9=39.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 40 fours and 39 eights in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place for three-digit numbers. Again, I'll consider how many times 4 and 8 appear in the units place across all three-digit page numbers.\n\nFor the units digit, each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, the units digit cycles through 0-9 ten times.\n\nSo, for 100-199: The units digit 4 appears in 104,114,124,...,194. That's 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in 108,118,...,198. Also 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 200-299: 204,214,...,294. 10 fours. 208,218,...,298. 10 eights.\n\nSame for 300-399: 304,...,394. 10 fours. 308,...,398. 10 eights.\n\nNow, for 400-488: The units digit 4 appears in 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. Wait, let me count. From 400-488, how many numbers end with 4? Let's see, starting at 404, then 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is within 488, but 494 would be beyond. So, 9 fours.\n\nSimilarly, for units digit 8: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 eights because 488 is included, so 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total fours in the units place: For the first three hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributes 10 fours, so 3x10=30. Plus, in 400-488, 9 fours. So, total 30+9=39 fours.\n\nSimilarly, eights in the units place: First three hundreds, 10 each, so 3x10=30. Plus, in 400-488, 9 eights. So, total 30+9=39 eights.\n\nWait, but let me check again. For 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs at 404,414,...,484. Let me count: 404 is the first, then each 10 numbers. So, 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers, as 494 would be beyond 488. So, 9 fours. Similarly, for 8's, 408,418,...,488. That's 9 numbers as well, since 488 is included.\n\nSo, units place: 39 fours and 39 eights.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit off because in the first three hundreds, it's 10 each, so 30, and then 9 more, making 39. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let me sum up all the counts for 4's and 8's.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- One-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: hundreds place:89, tens place:40, units place:39. So, total three-digit fours: 89+40+39=168.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Hundreds place: 89 fours (from 400-488). Tens place: 40 fours (from three-digit numbers). Units place:39 fours. So, 89+40+39=168 fours in three-digit numbers.\n\nSimilarly, total fours across all pages: one-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (168) = 1+19=20, 20+168=188 fours.\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\n- One-digit:1\n- Two-digit:19\n- Three-digit: hundreds place:0, tens place:39, units place:39. So, total three-digit eights: 0+39+39=78.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Hundreds place:0, tens place:39 (from earlier calculation), units place:39. So, 0+39+39=78 eights in three-digit numbers.\n\nTotal eights across all pages: one-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78) =1+19=20, 20+78=98 eights.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier I thought that in two-digit numbers, both 4's and 8's were at 19 each, so 20 each when including one-digit. But now, in three-digit numbers, fours are 168 and eights are 78. So, total fours:188, eights:98. So, the difference would be 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the three-digit counts.\n\nWait, for three-digit numbers:\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours.\n\nTens place:\n\n- 4's: 10 per hundred for the first three hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) = 3x10=30, plus in 400-488, tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 30+10=40 fours.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 4's: in each of the first three hundreds, 10 fours, so 3x10=30, plus in 400-488, 9 fours, so 30+9=39.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit:89+40+39=168. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's in three-digit:\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTens place:\n\n- In the first three hundreds, 10 eights each, so 3x10=30, plus in 400-488, tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 30+9=39.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- In the first three hundreds, 10 eights each, so 3x10=30, plus in 400-488, 9 eights. So, 30+9=39.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit:0+39+39=78. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, total 8's:98. The difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check again because earlier when I thought about two-digit numbers, I thought both 4's and 8's were at 19 each, so 20 each when including one-digit. But in three-digit numbers, 4's are much higher because of the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me recast this to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the three-digit counts.\n\nWait, for 4's in hundreds place: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nTens place: for each hundred, 10 fours in the tens place, so 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:10 (since 440-449). So, 4x10=40.\n\nUnits place: for each hundred, 10 fours, so 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, 3x10 +9=39.\n\nSo, 89+40+39=168 fours in three-digit numbers.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTens place:100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, 3x10+9=39.\n\nUnits place:100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, 3x10+9=39.\n\nSo, 39+39=78 eights in three-digit numbers.\n\nSo, total 4's:1 (one-digit) +19 (two-digit) +168=188.\n\nTotal 8's:1 +19 +78=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the difference would be 80, but perhaps it's 90. Let me check again.\n\nWait, let's recast the counts:\n\n- One-digit: 4:1, 8:1.\n\n- Two-digit:4:10 (tens) +9 (units)=19; 8:10 (tens)+9 (units)=19.\n\n- Three-digit:\n\n  - 4's: hundreds=89, tens=40, units=39. Total=168.\n\n  - 8's: hundreds=0, tens=39, units=39. Total=78.\n\nSo, total 4's:1+19+168=188.\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think if I missed anything. For example, in the three-digit numbers, did I count correctly for the units place?\n\nIn 400-488, units digit 4 occurs at 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 fours. Similarly, units digit 8 occurs at 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 eights.\n\nIn the first three hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each has 10 fours and 10 eights in the units place, so 3x10=30 each.\n\nSo, units place for 4's:30+9=39.\n\nUnits place for 8's:30+9=39.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, tens place for 4's:10 in each of the first three hundreds, and 10 in 400-488, so 40.\n\nTens place for 8's:10 in each of the first three hundreds, and 9 in 400-488, so 39.\n\nHundreds place:89 for 4's, 0 for 8's.\n\nSo, adding up, yes, 4's:168, 8's:78 in three-digit numbers.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, 8's:98.\n\nDifference:90.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by understanding the range of page numbers. The book has 488 pages, so the page numbers go from 1 to 488. That means the first page is 1, and the last is 488. Now, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the count of 8's from the count of 4's to get the difference.\n\nI think the best approach is to analyze each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll handle each place one by one for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place**: The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on.\n\n   Now, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and an additional 8 pages (481-488). In each of these 48 blocks, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the incomplete block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So, total units place 4's are 48.\n\n2. **Tens place**: The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for pages 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, in 101-200, it's 140-149, and so on.\n\n   Let's figure out how many hundreds are there in 488. There are four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-500. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last hundred is only up to 488.\n\n   For each hundred block except the last one, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, for 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, and 301-400, that's four blocks, each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40.\n\n   Now, in the last block, 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for pages 440-449, which is 10 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's would be 40 (from the first four blocks) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50.\n\n   Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check. The first block 1-100: 40-49 is 10 numbers. Similarly, 101-200: 140-149, another 10. 201-300: 240-249, 10. 301-400: 340-349, 10. Then 401-488: 440-449, which is 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. Wait, but 401-488 is the fifth block, but 488 is less than 500, so it's only up to 488. But the tens digit 4 in 401-488 is only from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So yes, 50 in total.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nWait, let me check that addition again. 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. That seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the digit 8:\n\n1. **Units place**: Similar to the 4's, in the units place, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, in 488 pages, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\n   Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and an extra 8 pages (481-488). In each block, 8 appears once, so 48 times. In the extra block, pages 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once here as well (page 488). So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place**: The tens digit is 8 for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Let's see how many times this happens.\n\n   Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, for 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers), 101-200: 180-189 (10), 201-300: 280-289 (10), 301-400: 380-389 (10), and 401-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, in the last block, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 times.\n\n   So, for the first four blocks (1-400), each contributes 10, so 4*10=40. The last block (401-488) contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The hundreds digit is 8 only for page numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 0 to the count of 8's.\n\nAdding up all the 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the total 8's from total 4's: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. That's correct.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. In the last block, 401-488, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 times, correct. So, 4 blocks with 10 each, and 1 block with 9, so 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, in the last block (401-488), the tens digit 4 is from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n1. **Counting 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 complete decades (1-480) and 8 extra pages (481-488). So, 48 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each hundred contributes 10, and the last block contributes 10. Total: 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n   - **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n2. **Counting 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. 48 complete decades and 8 extra pages, with 8 appearing once in the extra. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. Each hundred contributes 10, and the last block contributes 9. Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with one-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digits we're looking for are 4 and 8. So, how many 4's are there? Well, only one, which is page 4. Similarly, how many 8's? Only one, which is page 8. So in one-digit numbers, the count of 4's and 8's is equal, each being 1.\n\nNext, moving on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I think I should calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place separately.\n\nStarting with the tens place for two-digit numbers. The tens digit can be from 1 to 9. So, for 4 in the tens place, the numbers would be 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Similarly, for 8 in the tens place, the numbers are 80 to 89, which is another 10 occurrences.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers. The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each tens digit. So, for each group of ten numbers (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. There are 9 such groups (from 10-99), so 9 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once in each group's units place, so 9 occurrences of 8 in the units place.\n\nWait, but actually, from 10 to 99, there are 9 tens groups (10-19 up to 90-99). So, each digit from 0-9 appears 9 times in the units place, right? But wait, for 4 and 8, it's 9 times each in the units place. So, in the two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19. Similarly, for 8's, it's 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19. So, in two-digit numbers, the counts of 4's and 8's are equal again, each being 19.\n\nWait, but hold on, in the tens place, from 40-49, that's 10 numbers, so 10 4's. Similarly, 80-89 gives 10 8's. For the units place, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 9 times in the units place across all two-digit numbers. So, 4 appears 9 times, and 8 appears 9 times. So, adding up, 10 + 9 = 19 for both 4's and 8's in two-digit numbers. So, so far, the count is equal.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which go from 100 to 488. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the three-digit numbers are from 100 to 488. Let me break this down into hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because 488 is the last page. So, for the hundreds place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. That's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive), so 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, how about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all three-digit pages, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences of 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be from 0 to 9, and the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's first calculate how many times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nFor each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundreds group, 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.). However, for the 400-488 group, the tens digit goes up to 8, so 4 appears in the tens place as 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, for each of the four hundreds groups, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\nSimilarly, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Again, for each hundreds group, 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 180-189, 280-289, etc.). But wait, in the 400-488 group, the tens digit goes up to 8, so 480-489 would be the 8 in the tens place, but since the book ends at 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, 480-489 is 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. Hmm, so in the 400-488 group, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the first three hundreds groups (100-399), each has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so 3 * 10 = 30. Then, in the 400-488 group, it's 9 numbers. So total 30 + 9 = 39 times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. For hundreds groups 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so that's 3 * 10 = 30. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So total 30 + 9 = 39 times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each combination of hundreds and tens digits. So, for each hundreds group, each tens digit, the units digit 4 and 8 will each appear once every 10 numbers.\n\nLet's calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place. For each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), and for each tens digit (0-9), the units digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, for each hundreds group, there are 10 tens digits, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 10 per hundreds group. But wait, for the 400-488 group, the tens digits go up to 8, so there are 9 tens digits (0-8), each contributing one 4 in the units place. Wait, no, actually, the units digit is independent of the tens digit, so for each hundreds group, regardless of how many tens digits there are, each units digit from 0-9 appears equally. Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the total number of three-digit page numbers and then determine how many times each digit appears in the units place.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to think in terms of each hundreds group. For 100-199, there are 100 numbers. In each set of 10 numbers (like 100-109, 110-119, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, 10 times in the units place for each hundreds group. Since there are four hundreds groups (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), but wait, 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so maybe it's a bit different there.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the total number of three-digit numbers and then find how many times each digit appears in each place.\n\nWait, let me try this differently. For three-digit numbers from 100 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers are there? 488 - 100 + 1 = 389 numbers.\n\nNow, for the units digit, each digit from 0-9 appears equally often, except possibly in the last group if the total isn't a multiple of 10. Let me see: 389 divided by 10 is 38 full groups of 10, with 9 remaining numbers. So, each digit from 0-9 appears 38 times in the units place, and then for the remaining 9 numbers, the units digits are 0-8, each appearing once more. So, digits 0-8 appear 39 times, and 9 appears 38 times in the units place.\n\nWait, but wait, 389 numbers: 389 = 38*10 + 9. So, for each digit from 0-8, they appear 38 + 1 = 39 times in the units place, and 9 appears 38 times. So, the digit 4 appears 39 times in the units place, and 8 appears 39 times as well, since 8 is less than 9.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. If the last partial group is 9 numbers, the units digits would be 0-8, so yes, 0-8 each get one more occurrence, making it 39 times for each, while 9 remains at 38.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place in three-digit numbers, each digit from 0-9 appears equally in each position, except perhaps in the last group. Let me see: For the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each hundreds group. Since we have four hundreds groups (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), each with 100, 100, 100, and 89 numbers respectively.\n\nWait, for 100-199, 200-299, and 300-399, each has 100 numbers, so each tens digit (0-9) appears exactly 10 times in the tens place for each of these three groups. So, that's 3 * 10 = 30 times for each digit in the tens place from 0-9.\n\nNow, for the 400-488 group, which has 89 numbers. The tens digits go from 0 to 8, because 488 is the last page. So, for each tens digit from 0-8, how many times does each appear? Each tens digit from 0-8 appears 10 times, except for the last one, which might be incomplete. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is 8 full tens groups (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears only 9 times in this group, while the others (0-7) appear 10 times each.\n\nSo, in the 400-488 group, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and the tens digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488). Similarly, other digits appear 10 times each except 8, which appears 9 times.\n\nSo, for the tens place in three-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears 30 times (from the first three hundreds groups) plus 10 times in 400-449, making it 40 times. Wait, no, wait: in the first three hundreds groups, each digit appears 10 times per group, so 3 * 10 = 30. In the 400-488 group, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), so total for 4 in tens place is 30 + 10 = 40. Similarly, the digit 8 in the tens place appears 30 times from the first three groups (180-189, 280-289, 380-389), and in the 400-488 group, it's 9 times (480-488). So total 30 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 39 times for 8 in the tens place, which matches.\n\nNow, for the units place, as I calculated earlier, both 4 and 8 appear 39 times each in the units place of three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. The total number of three-digit numbers is 389. Each digit from 0-9 appears 38 times in the units place, and digits 0-8 appear one more time each in the last 9 numbers, making it 39 times for 0-8, and 38 times for 9. So yes, both 4 and 8 appear 39 times in the units place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in three-digit numbers.\n\nFor digit 4:\n- Hundreds place: 89 times (from 400-488)\n- Tens place: 40 times (30 from first three groups, 10 from 400-488)\n- Units place: 39 times\nTotal for 4: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 times\n\nFor digit 8:\n- Hundreds place: 0 times (since hundreds digits go up to 4)\n- Tens place: 39 times (30 from first three groups, 9 from 400-488)\n- Units place: 39 times\nTotal for 8: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78 times\n\nWait, but hold on, that seems a bit off. Let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4, so 89 times for 4 in hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4, it's 30 from the first three groups (10 each) plus 10 from 400-488 (440-449), totaling 40. For 8, it's 30 from the first three groups plus 9 from 400-488, totaling 39. That seems correct.\n\nIn the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 39 times each. So, total for 4 is 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. For 8, it's 0 + 39 + 39 = 78. So, the difference between 4's and 8's in three-digit numbers is 168 - 78 = 90.\n\nNow, let's not forget to add the counts from one-digit and two-digit numbers.\n\nFrom one-digit numbers:\n- 4: 1\n- 8: 1\n\nFrom two-digit numbers:\n- 4: 19\n- 8: 19\n\nSo, total for 4's: 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 168 = 188.\n\nTotal for 8's: 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 78 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that I didn't make a mistake in the three-digit counts. So, for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n- Tens place: 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n- Units place: 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\nSo, 4's total: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n8's total: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nAdding one-digit and two-digit:\n4's: 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 168 = 188\n8's: 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned about the units place in three-digit numbers. Let me recalculate that. The total number of three-digit numbers is 389. Each digit from 0-9 should appear approximately 38 or 39 times in each place.\n\nWait, 389 divided by 10 is 38.9, so each digit appears 38 times, and then the remaining 9 digits appear once more, making it 39 times. So, digits 0-8 appear 39 times in the units place, and 9 appears 38 times. So, yes, 4 and 8 each appear 39 times in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, for three-digit numbers, each digit from 0-9 appears 38 times, plus one more time for digits 0-8 in the last partial group, making it 39 times for 0-8 and 38 times for 9. Wait, no, that's not quite accurate. Wait, in the tens place, for each hundreds group, each digit appears 10 times. So, for the first three hundreds groups (100-399), each digit appears 3 * 10 = 30 times in the tens place. Then, in the 400-488 group, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except for 8, which appears 9 times because the last number is 488. So, for 4 in the tens place, it's 30 + 10 = 40 times. For 8, it's 30 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, as calculated, 4 and 8 each appear 39 times.\n\nSo, I think the counts are correct. Therefore, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check again the total number of three-digit numbers. From 100 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 100 + 1 = 389 numbers. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, another way to check: For each digit place, the total number of digits should be 389 numbers * 3 digits = 1167 digits. Let's see if the counts add up.\n\nFor 4's:\nHundreds place: 89\nTens place: 40\nUnits place: 39\nTotal: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n\nFor 8's:\nHundreds place: 0\nTens place: 39\nUnits place: 39\nTotal: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nNow, total digits accounted for in three-digit numbers for 4 and 8: 168 + 78 = 246. But wait, the total number of digits in three-digit numbers is 389 * 3 = 1167. So, 246 digits are 4's and 8's, which is a small fraction, so that seems plausible.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should check if the counts for other digits add up correctly, but maybe that's beyond the scope here.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n- One-digit numbers: 4 appears once, 8 appears once.\n- Two-digit numbers: 4 appears 19 times, 8 appears 19 times.\n- Three-digit numbers: 4 appears 168 times, 8 appears 78 times.\n\nAdding them up:\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **One-Digit Page Numbers (1-9):**\n   - **4's:** Appears once (page 4).\n   - **8's:** Appears once (page 8).\n\n2. **Two-Digit Page Numbers (10-99):**\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - 4 appears 10 times (40-49).\n     - 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Each digit (0-9) appears 9 times (once per ten numbers).\n     - 4 and 8 each appear 9 times.\n   - **Total for Two-Digit Numbers:**\n     - 4's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n     - 8's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\n3. **Three-Digit Page Numbers (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - 4 appears 89 times (pages 400-488).\n     - 8 appears 0 times.\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - 4 appears 40 times (30 from 100-399, 10 from 400-449).\n     - 8 appears 39 times (30 from 100-399, 9 from 480-488).\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Each digit 0-8 appears 39 times.\n     - 4 and 8 each appear 39 times.\n   - **Total for Three-Digit Numbers:**\n     - 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n     - 8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **4's:** 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n   - **8's:** 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90. \n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering the different places where the digits 4 and 8 can appear. These are the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place. I'll need to calculate how many times 4 appears in each of these positions and do the same for 8, then find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of ten pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. But wait, I need to check if 488 is a multiple of 10. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, that means there are 48 full groups of ten and then an extra 8 pages. So, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 times 1, which is 48, plus any extra 4's in the last partial group. The last group is 481 to 488, so the units digits go from 1 to 8. There's a 4 in 484, so that's one more. So total 4's in units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, each group of ten has one 8, so 48 times 1 is 48, plus the last group. In the last group, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So that's one more, making it 48 + 1 = 49. So, for the units place, both 4's and 8's appear 49 times. So, no difference there.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every 100 pages. So, for example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit is 4 for pages 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, it's 8 for 80-89, also 10 times. But again, since the book has 488 pages, I need to check how many full hundreds there are and if there's a partial hundred.\n\n488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds and a partial hundred. For each full hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages and 8 for another 10 pages. So, 4 full hundreds would give 4*10 = 40 4's in the tens place and 4*10 = 40 8's. Now, the partial hundred is from 401 to 488, which is 88 pages. In the tens place, we look at the numbers from 401 to 488. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 for pages 440-449, which is 10 pages, and 8 for pages 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is only 9 pages because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, the 4 appears 10 times, and the 8 appears 9 times in the partial hundred.\n\nSo, adding that up, for the tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 = 50 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 8's. So, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times. So, 4's have 1 more here.\n\nNow, onto the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and so on up to 4 for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit for 400-488 is 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. How about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. That's a difference of 89 more 4's than 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let me sum up the totals for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's), which equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- **4's:** Each ten-page block has one 4, and with 48 full blocks (480 pages) plus an extra page (484), totaling 49.\n- **8's:** Similarly, each ten-page block has one 8, and the last page (488) adds one more, totaling 49.\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- **4's:** Each hundred-page block has ten 4's in the tens place. With four full blocks (400 pages) contributing 40, and the partial block (401-488) adding ten more (440-449), totaling 50.\n- **8's:** Each hundred-page block has ten 8's, but the partial block only adds nine (480-488), totaling 49.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- **4's:** Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, totaling 89.\n- **8's:** No pages have 8 in the hundreds place, so 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by considering each place one by one. \n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 pages, the units digits cycle from 0 to 9. So in each set of 10 consecutive pages, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, the number of times a specific digit like 4 or 8 appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then checking if there's a remainder that affects the count.\n\nWait, let me think again. The total number of pages is 488. So, for the units place, the number of times each digit appears is 48 full sets of 10 (since 48*10=480), and then 8 more pages (481 to 488). So, for each digit, the count from the units place would be 48 times plus one more if the digit is less than or equal to 8, because 488 is the last page.\n\nWait, no, actually, the units digits go from 0 to 9 every 10 pages, so for each digit, the count is floor(488/10) = 48 times, and then for the remaining 8 pages, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so digits 1 through 8 get an extra count. So, for 4 and 8, they would each get an extra count in the units place because 4 and 8 are within 1 to 8.\n\nSo, for the units place, the count of 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49, and the count of 8's would also be 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, they are equal.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for example, in the tens place, the digit 4 would appear 10 times in 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how many full hundreds are there in 488. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 pages in the 400s (401-488). \n\nSo, for each digit in the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 4 times in each hundred, so 4*10=40 times. But wait, actually, each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 times each digit in the tens place.\n\nBut wait, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (for 401-410) to 8 (for 481-488). So, for each digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear in the tens place? Let's see: 401-410 is 10 pages, so 0 appears once in the tens place (but wait, 401 is 4 0 1, so 0 appears in the tens place from 401 to 410, which is 10 times, right? Wait, no, 401 is 4 0 1, 402 is 4 0 2, up to 410, which is 4 1 0. Wait, so from 401 to 410, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, which is 10 numbers, so 0 appears 10 times. Similarly, 411-420 would have 1 in the tens place, but we only go up to 488, so let's check how many full tens are there beyond 400.\n\nWait, 401-488 is 88 pages. So, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 pages). So, for each digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear in the tens place in 401-488?\n\n- 0: 401-410 \u2192 10 pages\n- 1: 411-420 \u2192 10 pages\n- 2: 421-430 \u2192 10 pages\n- 3: 431-440 \u2192 10 pages\n- 4: 441-450 \u2192 10 pages\n- 5: 451-460 \u2192 10 pages\n- 6: 461-470 \u2192 10 pages\n- 7: 471-480 \u2192 10 pages\n- 8: 481-488 \u2192 8 pages (since 488 is the last page)\n\nWait, that can't be right because 401-488 is 88 pages. Let's check: 401-410 is 10, 411-420 is 10, 421-430 is 10, 431-440 is 10, 441-450 is 10, 451-460 is 10, 461-470 is 10, 471-480 is 10, and 481-488 is 8. So that adds up to 10*8 + 8 = 88 pages. So, each digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nWait, but that's in the 400s. So, for the tens place overall, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 4 times in each hundred, so 4*10=40 times each. But in the 400s, the tens digits beyond 400 add more counts. Wait, no, perhaps I should separate the counts.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in the tens place across all page numbers up to 488.\n\nSo, for each hundred, the tens digits cycle from 0 to 9, each appearing 10 times. So, for 4 hundreds (1-400), each digit appears 4*10=40 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the pages 401-488, which is the 400s, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, the digit 0 appears 10 times (401-410), 1 appears 10 times (411-420), up to 8 appearing 8 times (481-488). So, in the 400s, the tens digits 0-7 each appear 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, in total, for the tens place:\n\n- For digits 0-7: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50 times each.\n- For digit 8: 40 (from 1-400) + 8 (from 401-488) = 48 times.\n- For digit 9: 40 times (since in 401-488, the tens digit never reaches 9, so only 40 times from 1-400).\n\nWait, but I'm only concerned with 4 and 8. So, for the tens place:\n\n- 4 appears 50 times (since 4 is in 0-7, so 40 +10=50)\n- 8 appears 48 times (40 +8=48)\n\nWait, but wait, in the 400s, the tens digit goes up to 8, so 8 appears 8 times in the 400s. So, 40 (from 1-400) +8=48 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 48 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only present in page numbers from 100 onwards. So, for pages 1-99, there is no hundreds digit. From 100 onwards, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nEach hundreds digit appears 100 times. For example, 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, 100 times. Similarly, 200-299: 2 appears 100 times, and so on up to 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, but only 89 times (since 400-488 is 89 pages, from 400 to 488 inclusive).\n\nWait, 400 is page 400, and 488 is the last page, so 488-400+1=89 pages. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nSo, for the hundreds place:\n\n- 1 appears 100 times (100-199)\n- 2 appears 100 times (200-299)\n- 3 appears 100 times (300-399)\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488)\n- 5 and above: not applicable since the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, for the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all because the highest page is 488, which is a three-digit number starting with 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, now, let's sum up the counts for 4 and 8 across all digit places.\n\nFor 4:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal for 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nFor 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 48 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal for 8: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nTotal pages 488. Units digits cycle every 10. So, 488 /10 = 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits from 1-8, so 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So, units place: 48*1 +1=49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) give 4*10=40 for each digit. Then, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0-8. So, for digits 0-7, each appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times. So, for 4, which is in 0-7, it's 40 +10=50. For 8, it's 40 +8=48. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly 4 appears, and it appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8: 49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =97.\n\nDifference: 188 -97=91.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 pages, so 89 times the hundreds digit is 4. So, that's correct.\n\nAnother thing to check: in the tens place, for 401-488, the tens digits for 401-410 is 0, so 401-410: 10 pages, 411-420:10, etc., up to 481-488:8 pages. So, for each digit from 0-8 in the tens place, except 8 which only appears 8 times, others appear 10 times. So, for 4, which is in 0-8, it's 10 times in 441-450, so 10 times. So, 40 (from 1-400) +10=50. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place, in 1-400, it's 40 times, and in 401-488, it's 8 times, so 48 total. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 and one 8, and the last 8 pages contributing one more 4 and one more 8. So, 49 each. Correct.\n\nSo, the total counts are correct, and the difference is 91.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 91.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4.\n\nFirst, considering the units place. For every group of ten numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers, which means 48 full groups of ten (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but we only take the integer part). So, 48 times 1 is 48. But wait, does 488 include an extra 4 in the units place? Let me check: 488 is the last page, which is 488, so the units digit is 8, not 4. So, the units place of 4 appears 48 times.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for numbers from 40 to 49, 140 to 149, 240 to 249, 340 to 349, and 440 to 449. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers long. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49 is one, 140-149 is another, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five ranges. Each range contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place, so 5 times 10 is 50. But wait, I need to check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, the tens place contributes 50 occurrences of 4.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. Let's see, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 minus 400 plus 1, which is 89 numbers. So, the hundreds place has 89 occurrences of 4.\n\nAdding them up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, the digit 4 appears 187 times.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place again. Similar to the 4's, in every group of ten numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full groups of ten are there? 48 full groups, as before, so 48 occurrences. Now, does 488 add an extra 8 in the units place? Yes, because 488 is the last page, so the units digit is 8. So, that's an additional 1, making it 49 times in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers from 80 to 89, 180 to 189, 280 to 289, 380 to 389, and 480 to 488. Let me count how many ranges that is. From 80-89 is one, 180-189 is another, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five ranges, but wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, not 10. So, for the first four ranges, each contributes 10 occurrences, and the last one contributes 9. So, 4 ranges times 10 is 40, plus 9 is 49. So, the tens place has 49 occurrences of 8.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800 to 899, but wait, our book only goes up to 488. So, 800 is way beyond 488, so there are no numbers in the hundreds place that have 8 as the hundreds digit. So, the hundreds place contributes 0 occurrences of 8.\n\nAdding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 is 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** Every group of ten numbers (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) has one 4 in the units place. There are 48 full groups (488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48), so 48 occurrences. The last page, 488, doesn't add an extra 4 in the units place.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place for 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each range contributes 10, and there are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** Numbers 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. There are 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to 4, there are 48 full groups, plus an extra 8 in 488, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each (40), and 480-488 contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No page numbers in 1-488 have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** There are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with one-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the number 4 appears once, and the number 8 also appears once. So, for one-digit numbers, the count of 4's and 8's is the same, each being 1. That means the difference here is zero.\n\nNext, I'll move on to two-digit page numbers, which go from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nFor the tens place in two-digit numbers, the number 4 can appear in the tens place for pages 40 to 49. That's 10 pages, so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for pages 80 to 89, which is another 10 times. \n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers, the digit 4 will appear once every ten numbers. For example, 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 times, right? Wait, no, from 10 to 99, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so from 10 to 99, there are 9 sets of 10, but actually, it's 9 times for each digit except maybe the last one. Wait, no, actually, it's 9 times because the first set is 10-19, which has 14, then 20-29 has 24, and so on up to 90-99, which has 94. So that's 9 times for the digit 4 in the units place. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the units place for 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's also 9 times. \n\nSo, in two-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times, and the digit 8 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times. So again, the difference is zero for two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which go from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because each page number has a hundreds place, a tens place, and a units place. \n\nLet me break this down by each place.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. In the hundreds place, the digits can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book has 488 pages. So, for the hundreds digit:\n\n- The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488. That's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n- The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is either 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, the digit 8 appears zero times in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place. For three-digit numbers, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each hundreds group. So, let's consider each hundreds group separately.\n\n- For hundreds digit 1 (pages 100-199): The tens digit can be 0-9. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for pages 140-149, which is 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for pages 180-189, which is 10 times.\n- For hundreds digit 2 (pages 200-299): Similarly, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 240-249 (10 times), and 8 appears in 280-289 (10 times).\n- For hundreds digit 3 (pages 300-399): The digit 4 appears in 340-349 (10 times), and 8 appears in 380-389 (10 times).\n- For hundreds digit 4 (pages 400-488): The tens digit here goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for pages 440-449, which is 10 times. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for pages 480-488, but wait, 488 is the last page. So, pages 480-488: that's 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place for the hundreds digit 4.\n\nSo, adding up the tens place for each hundreds group:\n\n- Digit 4: 10 (100s) + 10 (200s) + 10 (300s) + 10 (400s) = 40 times.\n- Digit 8: 10 (100s) + 10 (200s) + 10 (300s) + 9 (400s) = 39 times.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake here. Because for hundreds digit 4, the tens digit goes up to 8, so 480-488 is 9 pages, which is correct for the digit 8 in the tens place. So, digit 8 in the tens place is 39 times, and digit 4 is 40 times. So, in the tens place, digit 4 appears once more than digit 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place for three-digit numbers. Again, considering each hundreds group:\n\n- For hundreds digit 1 (100-199): The units digit cycles 0-9 for each tens group. So, in each set of 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same for 8. Since there are 10 tens groups (0-9), each digit appears 10 times in the units place. So, 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8.\n- Similarly, for hundreds digits 2, 3, and 4, the same applies. Each hundreds group has 10 tens groups, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for hundreds digit 2: 10 times each, hundreds digit 3: 10 times each, and hundreds digit 4: let's see, pages 400-488. The units digit cycles 0-9 for each tens group, except for the last tens group which might be cut short. Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, which is in the tens group 80-89. So, each tens group from 0-8 is complete, but 90-99 isn't there because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, 488 is in the tens group 80-89, so the units digits go up to 8 in that group. So, for the hundreds digit 4, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each tens group except the last one, which only goes up to 8. So, for each hundreds group, the units digit 4 appears once per tens group, except maybe the last one if it's cut short.\n\nWait, let me think again. For hundreds digit 4, the page numbers go from 400 to 488. So, the tens digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). For each tens digit, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9, except for the last tens digit (8), where it only goes up to 8. So, for the units digit 4:\n\n- In each tens group from 0 to 7, the units digit 4 appears once (e.g., 404, 414, ..., 474).\n- In the tens group 8, the units digit 4 appears once at 484.\n\nSo, that's 9 times for the digit 4 in the units place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place for hundreds digit 4:\n\n- In each tens group from 0 to 7, the units digit 8 appears once (e.g., 408, 418, ..., 478).\n- In the tens group 8, the units digit 8 appears once at 488.\n\nSo, that's 9 times for the digit 8 in the units place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nWait, but for hundreds digits 1, 2, and 3, the units digit cycles fully for each tens group, so each digit appears 10 times per hundreds group. So, for hundreds digit 1: 10 times for 4, 10 times for 8. Same for 2 and 3. So, total for hundreds digits 1,2,3: 3 hundreds groups \u00d7 10 = 30 times each for 4 and 8.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4: 9 times for 4 and 9 times for 8 in the units place.\n\nSo, total units place:\n\n- Digit 4: 30 + 9 = 39 times.\n- Digit 8: 30 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, that can't be right because in the hundreds digit 4, the units digit 4 appears 9 times, but in the hundreds digits 1,2,3, it's 10 times each, so 3\u00d710=30, plus 9 for 4, making 39. Similarly for 8, 3\u00d710=30 plus 9=39. So, both digits 4 and 8 appear 39 times in the units place across all three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake here because for hundreds digit 4, the units digit 4 appears once in each tens group from 0 to 8, which is 9 times, right? So, yes, 9 times. So, total units place for 4 is 3\u00d710 (from 1,2,3) + 9 (from 4) = 39. Same for 8: 3\u00d710 +9=39.\n\nSo, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 39 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit across all places.\n\nFor digit 4:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 times (from 400-488).\n- Tens place: 40 times (as calculated earlier).\n- Units place: 39 times.\n\nTotal for 4: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 times.\n\nFor digit 8:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0 times.\n- Tens place: 39 times (from earlier calculation).\n- Units place: 39 times.\n\nTotal for 8: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78 times.\n\nWait, that seems off because earlier I thought the tens place for 4 was 40 and for 8 was 39, but let me double-check that.\n\nWait, earlier in the tens place for three-digit numbers:\n\n- For hundreds digits 1,2,3: each contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place. So, 3\u00d710=30 for each digit.\n\n- For hundreds digit 4: 10 times for 4 (from 440-449) and 9 times for 8 (from 480-488). So, 10 for 4 and 9 for 8.\n\nSo, total tens place:\n\n- 4: 30 + 10 = 40\n- 8: 30 +9=39\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\n- 4: 89 times\n- 8: 0 times\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 4: 39 times\n- 8: 39 times\n\nSo, total for 4: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\nTotal for 8: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nSo, the difference is 168 - 78 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, another way: maybe I overcounted the hundreds place. Because in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4: 10 (from 100s) +10 (200s)+10(300s)+10(400s) =40. Wait, no, in the 400s, the tens place for 4 is 10 times (440-449). So, yes, 40 times.\n\nIn the units place, as calculated, 39 times.\n\nSo, 89 +40 +39=168 for 4.\n\nFor 8:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0\n- Tens place: 10 (100s) +10 (200s)+10(300s)+9(400s)=39\n- Units place: 39\nTotal: 39+39=78\n\nSo, 168-78=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is the units place for 4 in the hundreds digit 4 really 9 times? Because from 400-488, the units digit 4 appears in 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 times, correct.\n\nSimilarly, units digit 8 appears in 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 times.\n\nSo, yes, 9 each.\n\nSo, the total count for 4 is 89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (units) =168.\n\nFor 8, it's 0 (hundreds) +39 (tens) +39 (units)=78.\n\nSo, the difference is 168-78=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems a lot, but maybe that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach it by counting the number of times each digit appears in each position across all page numbers.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nTotal pages: 488.\n\nPage numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nNumber of digits:\n\n- Pages 1-9: 1 digit each, total 9 pages, 9 digits.\n- Pages 10-99: 2 digits each, total 90 pages, 180 digits.\n- Pages 100-488: 3 digits each, total 488-99=389 pages, 389\u00d73=1167 digits.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to count the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nLet's define positions as units, tens, hundreds.\n\nFor units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does each digit appear in the units place?\n\nIn each block of 10 numbers, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place.\n\nNumber of complete blocks of 10 in 488: 48 full blocks (1-480) and then 481-488.\n\nIn each block, digits 0-9 appear once, so for units digit:\n\n- For digits 0-9: 48 times each from 1-480, plus in 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so digits 1-8 appear once more.\n\nSo, total for units digit:\n\n- Digit 4: 48 +1=49 times\n- Digit 8:48 +1=49 times\n- Digits 1-9 except 4 and 8: 48 times each\n- Digit 0:48 times\n\nWait, but in 1-480, the units digit cycles 48 times, so digit 4 appears 48 times, and digit 8 appears 48 times. Then in 481-488, units digits are 1-8, so digit 4 appears once more, and digit 8 appears once more. So, total units digit counts:\n\n- 4:48+1=49\n- 8:48+1=49\n\nSo, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 39 times in three-digit numbers, but this approach seems different. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let's clarify. The units digit approach counts all page numbers, including one-digit and two-digit. So, in the units place, from 1 to 488, each digit 0-9 appears how many times?\n\nWait, actually, the first page is 1, so units digits start at 1. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does each digit appear in the units place?\n\nFor digit d (0-9), the number of times it appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades plus one if the last page is beyond the decade where d appears.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in units place from 1 to N is:\n\nfloor((N + 10 - d)/10)\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to compute as:\n\nFor each digit d (0-9), the number of times it appears in the units place from 1 to N is:\n\nnumber_of_times = (N // 10) + (1 if (N % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nBut since N is 488, let's compute for d=4 and d=8.\n\nFor d=4:\n\nnumber_of_times = 488 // 10 + (1 if (488 % 10) >=4 else 0) = 48 + (1 if 8 >=4 else 0) =48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8:\n\nnumber_of_times=488//10 + (1 if 8 >=8 else 0)=48 +1=49.\n\nSo, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place:\n\nThe number of times digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to N can be calculated as:\n\nnumber_of_times = (N // 100) * 10 + (min(10, N % 100 + 1) if (N // 10) % 10 >= d else 0)\n\nWait, maybe a better way is:\n\nFor each digit d, the number of times it appears in the tens place is:\n\n- For each hundred block (e.g., 1-100, 101-200, etc.), the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each (for 10 numbers each). So, in each hundred block, digit d appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\n- The number of complete hundred blocks is N // 100. For N=488, that's 4 complete hundred blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400).\n\n- Then, in the incomplete hundred block (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for each digit d from 0 to 8, it appears once in the tens place for each ten numbers. So, for d=4, it appears once in 440-449, which is 10 pages, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in the incomplete block.\n\nWait, no, in the incomplete block 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit d from 0 to 8, it appears 10 times (e.g., 400-409, 410-419, etc.), but since we're starting at 401, it's 401-410 (tens digit 0), 411-420 (tens digit 1), etc., up to 480-488 (tens digit 8). So, for each tens digit d from 0 to 8, it appears 10 times in the incomplete block except for d=8, which appears only 9 times (480-488).\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the incomplete block.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. For each tens digit d, the number of times it appears is 10 for d=0 to d=7, and 9 for d=8.\n\nSo, for digit 4 in the tens place:\n\n- In complete blocks (1-400): 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 times for d=4, so 4\u00d710=40.\n\n- In the incomplete block (401-488): d=4 appears 10 times (440-449). So, total for d=4 in tens place: 40 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8 in the tens place:\n\n- In complete blocks: 4\u00d710=40.\n\n- In incomplete block: d=8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total for d=8:40 +9=49.\n\nWait, so in the tens place, digit 4 appears 50 times, and digit 8 appears 49 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought digit 4 in the tens place was 40 times, but this approach gives 50 times. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let me check with a smaller example. Suppose N=148.\n\nFor d=4 in the tens place:\n\n- Complete blocks:1 (1-100), so 1\u00d710=10.\n\n- Incomplete block (101-148): tens digits go up to 4.\n\n- For d=4, it appears in 140-149, but since N=148, it's 140-148, which is 9 numbers, so d=4 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, total for d=4 in tens place:10 +9=19.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8 in tens place:\n\n- Complete blocks:1\u00d710=10.\n\n- In incomplete block, d=8 appears in 180-189, but since N=148, it doesn't appear. So, total for d=8:10.\n\nWait, but in N=148, the tens digit for 101-148 goes from 0 to4. So, d=8 doesn't appear in the tens place in the incomplete block. So, total for d=8:10.\n\nBut according to the formula I used earlier, for N=148, the incomplete block is 101-148, and the tens digits go up to 4, so d=8 doesn't appear. So, the count is correct.\n\nWait, so in the case of N=488, for d=4 in the tens place:\n\n- Complete blocks:4\u00d710=40.\n\n- Incomplete block:440-449, which is 10 numbers, so d=4 appears 10 times.\n\nTotal:40 +10=50.\n\nFor d=8 in the tens place:\n\n- Complete blocks:4\u00d710=40.\n\n- In incomplete block:480-488, which is 9 numbers, so d=8 appears 9 times.\n\nTotal:40 +9=49.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place:\n\nDigit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nDigit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so hundreds digits are 1,2,3,4.\n\nSo, digit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up:\n\n- Digit 4:\n\n  - Hundreds place:89\n\n  - Tens place:50\n\n  - Units place:49\n\n  Total:89 +50 +49=188\n\n- Digit 8:\n\n  - Hundreds place:0\n\n  - Tens place:49\n\n  - Units place:49\n\n  Total:0 +49 +49=98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier when I considered three-digit numbers separately, I got 168 for 4 and 78 for 8, but that approach didn't account for one-digit and two-digit numbers properly. It seems that using the position-wise counting gives a different result, 90, which is higher than before.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the three-digit numbers approach by not considering that in two-digit and one-digit numbers, the digits 4 and 8 also appear in the units and tens places.\n\nWait, in the initial approach, I considered one-digit numbers: 1-9, two-digit:10-99, and three-digit:100-488.\n\nIn that approach, for one-digit numbers, 4 and 8 each appear once.\n\nIn two-digit numbers, 4 appears 19 times, 8 appears 19 times.\n\nIn three-digit numbers, using the earlier method, I got 4:89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (units)=168\n\n8:0 (hundreds)+39 (tens)+39 (units)=78\n\nBut when I did the position-wise counting, I included all page numbers, and got 4:89 (hundreds)+50 (tens)+49 (units)=188\n\n8:0 (hundreds)+49 (tens)+49 (units)=98\n\nSo, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, so which is correct? I think the position-wise counting is more accurate because it accounts for all positions across all page numbers.\n\nBut let's reconcile the two methods.\n\nIn the initial approach, I considered:\n\n- One-digit: 1-9: 4 and 8 each appear once.\n\n- Two-digit:10-99: 4 appears 19 times, 8 appears 19 times.\n\n- Three-digit:100-488: 4 appears 168 times, 8 appears 78 times.\n\nWait, but that's 1+19+168=188 for 4, and 1+19+78=98 for 8, which matches the position-wise counting.\n\nSo, in the initial approach, I had:\n\n- For three-digit numbers, 4 appears 168-1=167? Wait, no, I think I had 89 (hundreds)+40 (tens)+39 (units)=168.\n\nWait, but in the initial approach, I considered three-digit numbers separately, and in the position-wise approach, I included all page numbers, which includes one-digit and two-digit.\n\nSo, the total counts are:\n\n- 4:1 (one-digit) +19 (two-digit) +168 (three-digit)=1+19+168=188\n\n- 8:1 (one-digit)+19 (two-digit)+78 (three-digit)=1+19+78=98\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count anything. In the position-wise approach, I considered all page numbers, including one-digit and two-digit, so that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting in One-Digit Page Numbers (1-9):**\n   - Both '4' and '8' appear once each.\n\n2. **Counting in Two-Digit Page Numbers (10-99):**\n   - **Tens Place:** '4' appears 10 times (40-49), '8' appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - **Units Place:** '4' appears 9 times (14, 24, ..., 94), '8' appears 9 times (18, 28, ..., 98).\n   - Total for two-digit numbers: '4' appears 19 times, '8' appears 19 times.\n\n3. **Counting in Three-Digit Page Numbers (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds Place:** '4' appears 89 times (400-488), '8' does not appear.\n   - **Tens Place:** \n     - For hundreds 1,2,3: Each contributes 10 times for '4' and '8'.\n     - For hundreds 4: '4' appears 10 times (440-449), '8' appears 9 times (480-488).\n     - Total: '4' appears 40 times, '8' appears 39 times.\n   - **Units Place:** \n     - For hundreds 1,2,3: Each contributes 10 times for '4' and '8'.\n     - For hundreds 4: '4' appears 9 times, '8' appears 9 times.\n     - Total: '4' appears 39 times, '8' appears 39 times.\n\n4. **Summing Up All Counts:**\n   - **For '4':** 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 188.\n   - **For '8':** 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering one-digit page numbers. These are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digit 4 appears once (which is page 4), and the digit 8 also appears once (page 8). So, for one-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear the same number of times, which is 1 each. That means the difference here is zero.\n\nNext, I'll look at two-digit page numbers, which range from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each position.\n\nStarting with the tens place for two-digit numbers:\n- The tens digit cycles from 1 to 9. For each tens digit, there are 10 numbers. So, for the tens digit being 4, the numbers are 40 to 49. That's 10 instances where 4 is in the tens place. Similarly, for the tens digit being 8, the numbers are 80 to 89, which is another 10 instances where 8 is in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers:\n- The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each tens digit. So, for each tens digit (1 through 9), the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. Since there are 9 tens digits, the digit 4 appears 9 times in the units place, and 8 also appears 9 times in the units place.\n\nAdding these up for two-digit numbers:\n- 4's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n- 8's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\nSo, again, the difference is zero for two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which go from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because the hundreds, tens, and units places all come into play. Let's break it down by each digit position.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place:\n- The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book has 488 pages. \n- For hundreds digit 4: The numbers range from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all because the hundreds digit only goes up to 4.\n\nNext, the tens place for three-digit numbers:\n- The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each hundreds digit. So, for each hundreds digit (1, 2, 3, 4), the tens digit goes through 0-9 ten times each. Wait, no, actually, for each hundreds digit, the tens digit cycles 0-9, and for each of those, the units digit cycles 0-9, making 100 numbers per hundreds group.\n\nBut since the book ends at 488, the last group (hundreds digit 4) only goes up to 488, so the tens digit in the hundreds group 4 goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). Wait, no, actually, 488 is the last page, so the hundreds digit 4 has tens digits from 0 to 8, but when the tens digit is 8, the units digit only goes up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). Hmm, this might complicate things a bit.\n\nLet me approach this methodically.\n\nFirst, for the hundreds digits 1, 2, and 3:\n- For each of these, the tens digit can be 0-9, and the units digit can be 0-9, so each tens digit appears 10 times per hundreds group.\n- So, for each hundreds digit (1, 2, 3), the digit 4 in the tens place appears 10 times, and the digit 8 in the tens place appears 10 times.\n- Since there are 3 hundreds digits (1, 2, 3), the total number of times 4 appears in the tens place is 3 * 10 = 30.\n- Similarly, 8 appears 3 * 10 = 30 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the hundreds digit 4:\n- The tens digit can be 0-8 (since 488 is the last page, so when tens digit is 8, units digit only goes up to 8). Wait, no, actually, 488 is the last page, so the tens digit in the hundreds group 4 can be from 0 to 8, but when the tens digit is 8, the units digit can only go up to 8, not 9. So, let's see how this affects the count.\n\nWait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 4, so the page numbers go from 400 to 488. So, the tens digit in the hundreds group 4 can be from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place?\n\n- For tens digits 0-7: Each of these digits appears 10 times because the units digit can be 0-9. For example, tens digit 0: 400-409 (10 numbers), tens digit 1: 410-419, etc., up to tens digit 7: 470-479.\n- For tens digit 8: The units digit can only go up to 8, so it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is included). So, the digit 8 in the tens place appears 9 times here.\n\nWait, but I'm trying to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place for the hundreds group 4. So, for the tens digit being 4: How many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify. I'm supposed to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place across all page numbers.\n\nSo, for the hundreds group 4 (400-488):\n\n- Tens digit 4: The numbers would be 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n- Tens digit 8: The numbers would be 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that for hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, each tens digit appears 10 times, but for hundreds digit 4, it's a bit different because the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, let me correct that.\n\nFor hundreds digits 1, 2, 3:\n- Each tens digit (0-9) appears 10 times in the tens place, so 4 appears 10 times per hundreds group, and 8 appears 10 times per hundreds group.\n- So, for 3 hundreds groups, 4 appears 3*10 = 30 times, and 8 appears 3*10 = 30 times.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4:\n- Tens digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page, so tens digit 8 is the last one, and units digit can't go beyond 8).\n- So, for tens digit 4: numbers 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times.\n- For tens digit 8: numbers 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times.\n- For other tens digits (0,1,2,3,5,6,7), each appears 10 times, but since we're only interested in 4 and 8, we can ignore the others.\n\nSo, in the hundreds group 4, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nAdding this to the previous counts:\n- Total 4's in tens place: 30 (from 1-3) + 10 (from 4) = 40\n- Total 8's in tens place: 30 (from 1-3) + 9 (from 4) = 39\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, no, actually, for hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, each has tens digits 0-9, so each digit appears 10 times per hundreds group. So, for 4's in the tens place, that's 3*10=30. Similarly, 8's in the tens place are 3*10=30.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4, the tens digits go up to 8, so:\n- Tens digit 4: 10 times (440-449)\n- Tens digit 8: 9 times (480-488)\nSo, 4's in tens place: 10\n8's in tens place: 9\n\nSo total 4's in tens place: 30 +10=40\nTotal 8's in tens place: 30 +9=39\n\nNow, moving on to the units place for three-digit numbers.\n\nFor hundreds digits 1, 2, 3:\n- Each hundreds group has 100 numbers (e.g., 100-199, 200-299, 300-399).\n- In each group, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each tens digit. So, for each hundreds group, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the units place (e.g., 104,114,124,...,194), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (108,118,...,198).\n- Since there are 3 such hundreds groups, the total number of 4's in the units place is 3*10=30.\n- Similarly, 8's in the units place are 3*10=30.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4 (400-488):\n- The units digit cycles 0-9 for each tens digit, except when the tens digit is 8, where units digits only go up to 8.\n- So, for each tens digit from 0 to 7, the units digit cycles 0-9, so 4 appears once per tens group (e.g., 404,414,...,474), which is 8 times (tens digits 0-7).\n- For tens digit 8, units digits go up to 8, so 484 is included, but 488 is the last page. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n\nWait, no, for the units place in the hundreds group 4:\n\n- For each tens digit from 0 to 7, the units digit cycles 0-9, so for each of these, 4 appears once in the units place, so 8 tens digits (0-7) each contributing 1, so 8 times.\n- For tens digit 8, the units digits go from 0-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n\nSo, total 4's in units place for hundreds group 4: 8 (from tens 0-7) +1 (from tens 8) =9\nTotal 8's in units place for hundreds group 4: 8 (from tens 0-7) +1 (from tens 8) =9\n\nWait, that seems incorrect because for tens digits 0-7, each has 10 units digits, so 4 appears once per tens group, so 8 tens groups (0-7) would give 8*1=8 times. Then, for tens digit 8, units digits go up to 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total 4's in units place for hundreds group 4: 8+1=9, and 8's in units place: 8+1=9.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because in the hundreds group 4, the units digits for each tens group 0-7 should have 10 numbers, so 4 appears once per tens group, so 8 tens groups (0-7) would give 8*1=8. Then, in tens group 8, units digits go up to 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total 4's in units place: 8+1=9, and 8's in units place: 8+1=9.\n\nWait, but that would mean that in hundreds group 4, 4 appears 9 times in the units place, and 8 appears 9 times. So, adding to the previous counts:\n\nTotal 4's in units place: 30 (from 1-3) +9=39\nTotal 8's in units place:30 (from 1-3) +9=39\n\nWait, but that can't be right because earlier, in the tens place, we had 40 4's and 39 8's, but in the units place, both would be 39 each. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the units place count.\n\nWait, let me think again. For hundreds digits 1,2,3:\n\nEach has 100 numbers, so for each, the units digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, for each hundreds group, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the units place, and 8 appears 10 times. So, 3 groups would give 30 each.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4 (400-488):\n\nThe units digit appears in each tens group as follows:\n\n- Tens digits 0-7: Each has 10 units digits (0-9), so 4 appears once per tens group, so 8 tens groups (0-7) give 8 times.\n- Tens digit 8: Units digits go up to 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n\nSo, total 4's in units place for hundreds group 4: 8 +1=9\nTotal 8's in units place for hundreds group 4: 8 +1=9\n\nSo, adding to the previous counts:\n\n4's in units place:30 +9=39\n8's in units place:30 +9=39\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences of 4 and 8 in the three-digit numbers.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Hundreds place: 89 (from 400-488)\n- Tens place:40\n- Units place:39\nTotal 4's in three-digit numbers:89 +40 +39=168\n\nFor 8's:\n- Hundreds place:0 (since hundreds digits go up to 4)\n- Tens place:39 (from 1-3:30, and 4:9)\n- Units place:39\nTotal 8's in three-digit numbers:0 +39 +39=78\n\nWait, but let me double-check the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, how many numbers is that? 488 -400 +1=89 numbers, so each of these has a hundreds digit of 4, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nNow, let me add up all the 4's and 8's across all page numbers.\n\nFirst, one-digit numbers:\n- 4:1\n- 8:1\n\nTwo-digit numbers:\n- 4:19\n- 8:19\n\nThree-digit numbers:\n- 4:168\n- 8:78\n\nTotal 4's:1 +19 +168=188\nTotal 8's:1 +19 +78=98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the three-digit numbers. Let me go through each digit place again.\n\nHundreds place for three-digit numbers:\n- 4's:89 (from 400-488)\n- 8's:0\n\nTens place for three-digit numbers:\n- 4's: For hundreds digits 1-3, each has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place, so 3*10=30. For hundreds digit 4, tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449). So, total 4's in tens place:30+10=40\n- 8's: For hundreds digits 1-3, each has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place, so 3*10=30. For hundreds digit 4, tens digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total 8's in tens place:30+9=39\n\nUnits place for three-digit numbers:\n- 4's: For hundreds digits 1-3, each has 10 occurrences of 4 in the units place, so 3*10=30. For hundreds digit 4, 4 appears 9 times in the units place (as calculated earlier). So, total 4's in units place:30+9=39\n- 8's: Similarly, for hundreds digits 1-3, each has 10 occurrences of 8 in the units place, so 3*10=30. For hundreds digit 4, 8 appears 9 times in the units place. So, total 8's in units place:30+9=39\n\nAdding up:\n- 4's in three-digit numbers:89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (units)=168\n- 8's in three-digit numbers:0 (hundreds) +39 (tens) +39 (units)=78\n\nNow, adding one-digit and two-digit numbers:\n- 4's:1 +19=20\n- 8's:1 +19=20\n\nTotal 4's:20 +168=188\nTotal 8's:20 +78=98\n\nDifference:188 -98=90\n\nWait, but I'm getting 90 as the difference, but I feel like that might be too high. Let me check another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider each digit place separately across all page numbers, not just three-digit, two-digit, and one-digit.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nEach page number can be 1-digit, 2-digit, or 3-digit. Let's consider each digit place separately.\n\nUnits place:\n- For all page numbers from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n- Similarly, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nTens place:\n- Similarly, count occurrences of 4 and 8.\n\nHundreds place:\n- Similarly, count occurrences of 4 and 8.\n\nLet me start with the units place.\n\nUnits place:\n- From 1 to 488, each units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers.\n- So, for each complete set of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place, and 8 appears once.\n- How many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8.\n- So, 48 complete sets, each contributing 1 occurrence of 4 and 1 of 8 in the units place.\n- That's 48*1=48 for both 4 and 8.\n- Now, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8.\n- In these, 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488).\n- So, total 4's in units place:48 +1=49\n- Total 8's in units place:48 +1=49\n\nWait, but this contradicts my earlier count. Earlier, I had 39 4's and 39 8's in the units place for three-digit numbers, plus 1 and 1 from one-digit, and 9 and 9 from two-digit, but this approach gives 49 each. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the previous method.\n\nWait, let me clarify. When considering all page numbers up to 488, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does each digit appear in the units place?\n\nWait, but page numbers start at 1, not 0, so the first page is 1, which is a units digit of 1, and the last page is 488, which is units digit 8.\n\nSo, for units digits:\n- The number of times each digit d (0-9) appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra in the incomplete decade.\n\nBut since page numbers start at 1, the first page is 1, so the first units digit is 1, not 0. So, for the units place:\n\nTotal numbers:488\nNumber of complete decades:488 //10=48 (since 48*10=480)\nRemaining numbers:488 -480=8 (481-488)\n\nIn each complete decade (e.g., 1-10, 11-20, etc.), each units digit from 0-9 appears exactly once. But wait, page numbers start at 1, so the first decade is 1-10, which includes units digits 1-0 (since 10 is the 10th page). So, in each complete decade, digits 0-9 appear once each in the units place.\n\nTherefore, for 48 complete decades, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place.\n\nNow, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8. So, digits 1-8 appear once each, and 9 and 0 don't appear in the units place here.\n\nSo, total occurrences:\n- For digits 1-8:48 +1=49\n- For digits 9 and 0:48 times each, but 0 appears only in the units place of 10,20,...,480, so 48 times.\n\nWait, but in our problem, we're interested in digits 4 and 8.\n\nSo, for 4's in units place:48 (from complete decades) +1 (from 484)=49\nFor 8's in units place:48 (from complete decades) +1 (from 488)=49\n\nWait, so according to this, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place. That's different from my earlier calculation of 39 each in three-digit numbers plus 1 each in one-digit and two-digit. Hmm, perhaps I need to reconcile these.\n\nWait, perhaps my initial approach was wrong because I separated one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers, but when considering all page numbers, the units digit counts are different.\n\nWait, let me try to calculate the units place correctly.\n\nWait, in the units place:\n- From 1 to 488, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place, except for the last partial decade.\n\nWait, but page numbers start at 1, so the first decade is 1-10, which includes units digits 1-0. So, in each complete decade (10 numbers), each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place.\n\nSo, 48 complete decades:48*10=480 pages.\n\nThen, the last 8 pages:481-488, which have units digits 1-8.\n\nSo, for units digits:\n- Digits 1-8:48 +1=49\n- Digits 9 and 0:48 times each\n\nTherefore, 4's in units place:49\n8's in units place:49\n\nSimilarly, for tens place:\n\nTens place:\n- Each tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred.\n- From 1 to 488, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nWait, but let me think differently. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers, with each digit 0-9 appearing 10 times in the tens place per hundred.\n\nSo, for 400 pages, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 for each digit in the tens place.\n\nBut wait, 400 pages would be up to page 400, but our book goes up to 488, so we have an additional 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn these 88 pages, the tens digit cycles as follows:\n- Pages 401-410: tens digit 0\n- 411-420: tens digit 1\n- ...\n- 481-488: tens digit 8\n\nSo, for the tens digit in 401-488:\n- Tens digits go from 0 to 8, but only up to page 488, which is in the tens digit 8 group (480-488).\n\nSo, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place in 401-488?\n\n- For tens digits 0-7: Each appears 10 times (e.g., 401-410 for tens digit 0, 411-420 for tens digit 1, etc.)\n- For tens digit 8: Pages 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488 inclusive)\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 pages, so tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in this range.\n\nSo, total occurrences in tens place for 401-488:\n- Tens digits 0-7:10 each\n- Tens digit 8:9\n\nSo, for each digit in the tens place from 0-9:\n- Digits 0-7:10 times each in 401-488\n- Digit 8:9 times\n- Digit 9:0 times (since we don't reach 490-499)\n\nNow, adding to the previous 4 hundreds (1-400), where each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place per hundred, so 4*10=40 times each.\n\nSo, total occurrences in tens place:\n- For digits 0-7:40 (from 1-400) +10 (from 401-488)=50\n- Digit 8:40 (from 1-400) +9 (from 401-488)=49\n- Digit 9:40 times (only from 1-400, since 490-499 isn't included)\n\nTherefore, in the tens place:\n- 4 appears 50 times\n- 8 appears 49 times\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place:50\nTotal 8's in tens place:49\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nHundreds place:\n- Pages 1-99: no hundreds digit, so 0\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit 1, appearing 100 times\n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit 2, appearing 100 times\n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit 3, appearing 100 times\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit 4, appearing 89 times (since 488-400+1=89)\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n- 4 appears 89 times\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place:89\nTotal 8's in hundreds place:0\n\nNow, summing up all occurrences:\n\n4's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188\n\n8's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:188 -98=90\n\nWait, so according to this, the difference is 90. But earlier, when I broke it down into one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers, I also got 90. So, perhaps that's correct after all.\n\nBut let me check once more to be sure.\n\nWait, in the units place, I calculated 49 each for 4 and 8, but in the initial approach, I had 39 each for three-digit numbers, plus 1 each for one-digit and two-digit, totaling 41 each, which doesn't match. So, perhaps the mistake was in the initial approach where I separated one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers, and didn't account for all the units and tens digits correctly.\n\nBut in the second approach, considering all page numbers from 1 to 488, I get 4's:188 and 8's:98, difference 90.\n\nWait, but let me verify the counts again.\n\nUnits place:\n- Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place from 1-480, and then digits 1-8 appear once more in 481-488. So, 4 and 8 each appear 48 +1=49 times.\n\nTens place:\n- From 1-400, each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place (4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times per digit).\n- From 401-488, tens digits 0-7 appear 10 times each, and 8 appears 9 times.\n- So, for 4:40 +10=50\n- For 8:40 +9=49\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488)\n- 8 appears 0 times\n\nAdding up:\n- 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n- 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98\n\nDifference:188 -98=90\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place for the first 480 pages.\n   - Pages 481-488 add one more occurrence each for digits 1-8.\n   - **Count for 4:** 48 + 1 = 49\n   - **Count for 8:** 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place for the first 400 pages.\n   - Pages 401-488 add 10 occurrences each for digits 0-7 and 9 occurrences for digit 8.\n   - **Count for 4:** 40 + 10 = 50\n   - **Count for 8:** 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 contribute 89 occurrences of '4' in the hundreds place.\n   - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - **Count for 4:** 89\n   - **Count for 8:** 0\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:**\nThe digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8' in the page numbers. \n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with one-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digits 4 and 8 each appear once. So, for one-digit numbers, the count of 4's is 1 and the count of 8's is also 1. That means, so far, they are equal.\n\nNext, moving on to two-digit page numbers, which go from 10 to 99. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place and the units place separately. \n\nFor the tens place: The two-digit numbers where the tens digit is 4 are from 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place, the numbers are from 80 to 89, which is another 10 numbers, so 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the units place: In the two-digit numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place for every ten numbers. So, for example, in 10-19, the units digits go from 0-9, so 4 appears once and 8 appears once. This pattern repeats for every set of ten numbers. Since there are 9 sets of ten in the two-digit numbers (10-99), that's 9 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place. So, 9 times each.\n\nWait, but actually, from 10 to 99, that's 90 numbers, which is 9 sets of 10. So, yes, each digit from 0-9 appears 9 times in the units place. So, for 4 and 8, that's 9 each in the units place.\n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, the total count for 4's is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. Similarly, for 8's, it's 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. So, they're equal again in two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which in this case go from 100 to 488. So, these are all the page numbers from 100 up to 488. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book has 488 pages. \n\n- For hundreds digit 1: The page numbers are 100 to 199. Here, 4 and 8 don't appear in the hundreds place, so no contribution from here.\n- For hundreds digit 2: Similarly, 200 to 299. Again, hundreds digit is 2, so no 4 or 8 here.\n- For hundreds digit 3: 300 to 399. Same as above, hundreds digit is 3, so no 4 or 8 in the hundreds place.\n- For hundreds digit 4: 400 to 488. Here, the hundreds digit is 4, so every number from 400 to 488 will have a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place here because the hundreds digit is 4, so no contribution from 8 in the hundreds place for three-digit numbers.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. We need to consider each hundred separately, from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\n- For 100-199: The tens digit cycles from 0-9, so each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 10 times in the tens place here.\n- For 200-299: Similarly, the tens digit cycles 0-9, so 4 and 8 each appear 10 times.\n- For 300-399: Same as above, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place.\n- For 400-488: Now, the tens digit can be 0-8 because 488 is the last page. So, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, which is 9 possible digits. So, for each tens digit, there are 10 numbers (e.g., 400-409, 410-419, etc.), except the last one which might be cut short. Wait, actually, from 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but the units digits go from 0 to 9 except for the last tens group, which might not have all units digits.\n\nWait, let's see. From 400-488, the tens digits are 0 (for 400-409), 1 (410-419), 2 (420-429), ..., up to 8 (480-488). So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 is present, but for tens digit 8, the units digits only go up to 8, not 9. So, for tens digits 0-7, each has 10 numbers, and for tens digit 8, there are 9 numbers (480-488). \n\nSo, in the tens place for 400-488, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see. The tens digit is 4 when the page numbers are 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place here. Similarly, when does 8 appear in the tens place? It's when the tens digit is 8, which is 480-488. That's 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake. Let me clarify. In the tens place, when considering 400-488, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears a certain number of times. For 4, the tens digit is 4, so that's 10 times. For 8, the tens digit is 8, which occurs 9 times (since 480-488 is 9 numbers). So, in the tens place for 400-488, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nBut wait, I think I need to correct this. Actually, in the tens place for 400-488, each tens digit from 0 to 8 is present, but for the 8 tens digit, the units digits go from 0 to 8, which is 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here. For 4 in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times.\n\nSo, in total, for the tens place in three-digit numbers:\n\n- For 100-199: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n- For 200-299: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n- For 300-399: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n- For 400-488: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, adding these up:\n\n4's in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 times.\n\n8's in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, that seems off because I think I might have double-counted or missed something. Let me check again.\n\nActually, for each hundred (100-199, etc.), the tens digit cycles through 0-9 for each set of 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. So, for 100-199, 200-299, and 300-399, each contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place. That's 3 hundreds, so 3*10=30 for each digit. Then, for 400-488, as we saw, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times in the tens place. So, total for tens place in three-digit numbers:\n\n4's: 30 + 10 = 40\n\n8's: 30 + 9 = 39\n\nSo, 4's have 40, 8's have 39 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, considering each hundred separately.\n\n- For 100-199: The units digit cycles 0-9 for each tens group. So, in each set of 10 numbers, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. There are 10 tens groups (0-9), so for each hundred, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 10 times in the units place.\n- Similarly, for 200-299 and 300-399, each contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the units place.\n- For 400-488: The units digit cycles 0-9 for each tens group, but we have to check how many complete tens groups there are. From 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, so 9 tens groups. Each tens group has 10 units digits, so for each tens group, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, for 400-488, 4 appears 9 times in the units place, and 8 appears 9 times as well.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. For 400-488, each tens group (like 400-409, 410-419, etc.) has 10 numbers, except the last one, 480-488, which has 9 numbers. So, for the units place, in each tens group, 4 and 8 each appear once, except maybe the last one. But in 480-488, the units digits go from 0-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, actually, in each tens group from 400-488, whether it's complete or not, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. Since there are 9 tens groups (0-8), 4 appears 9 times and 8 appears 9 times in the units place for 400-488.\n\nSo, adding up the units place contributions:\n\n- For 100-199: 10 times each\n- For 200-299: 10 times each\n- For 300-399: 10 times each\n- For 400-488: 9 times each\n\nSo, total for units place in three-digit numbers:\n\n4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n\n8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n\nWait, that can't be right because 400-488 has 9 tens groups, each contributing 1 occurrence of 4 and 8 in the units place, so 9 each. So, yes, 39 each.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences of 4 and 8 in three-digit numbers.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89\n- Tens place: 40\n- Units place: 39\nTotal 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0 (since hundreds digits are 1,2,3,4)\n- Tens place: 39\n- Units place: 39\nTotal 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nWait, that seems like a big difference. Let me check my calculations again because 168 vs 78 seems quite large, and I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I overcounted in the hundreds place. Let me go back.\n\nIn the hundreds place for three-digit numbers, from 400-488, each number has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for three-digit numbers:\n\n- 100-199: 10 times each for 4 and 8\n- 200-299: 10 each\n- 300-399: 10 each\n- 400-488: 10 for 4 (in 440-449) and 9 for 8 (in 480-488)\nSo, 4's in tens place: 3*10 +10 = 40\n8's in tens place: 3*10 +9 = 39\n\nIn the units place:\n\n- 100-199: 10 each\n- 200-299: 10 each\n- 300-399: 10 each\n- 400-488: 9 each\nSo, 4's: 3*10 +9 = 39\n8's: 3*10 +9 = 39\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (units) = 168\n\nTotal 8's in three-digit numbers: 0 (hundreds) +39 (tens) +39 (units) =78\n\nSo, that seems correct. Now, let's add up all the digits from one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nFrom one-digit:\n\n4's:1, 8's:1\n\nFrom two-digit:\n\n4's:19, 8's:19\n\nFrom three-digit:\n\n4's:168, 8's:78\n\nSo, total 4's:1 +19 +168 = 188\n\nTotal 8's:1 +19 +78 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98 =90\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me verify again.\n\nWait, in three-digit numbers, 4's are 168, 8's are 78. Then, adding the one-digit and two-digit counts:\n\nOne-digit: 1 each\n\nTwo-digit:19 each\n\nSo, total 4's:1+19+168=188\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but I feel like maybe I made a mistake in the three-digit counts because 168 seems high. Let me check the three-digit counts again.\n\nIn three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 times 4\n- Tens place: 40 times 4\n- Units place:39 times 4\nTotal:89+40+39=168\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Hundreds place:0\n- Tens place:39\n- Units place:39\nTotal:78\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for three-digit numbers. Let me check again.\n\nIn the tens place for three-digit numbers:\n\n- For 100-199: Each tens digit from 0-9 appears 10 times, so 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n- Similarly for 200-299 and 300-399: Each contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8.\n- For 400-488: The tens digits go from 0-8, so 9 tens groups. For 4 in the tens place, it's when the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers (440-449). For 8 in the tens place, it's when the tens digit is 8, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, for 4's in tens place: 3*10 +10=40\n\nFor 8's in tens place:3*10 +9=39\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place:\n\n- For each hundred, 10 times each for 4 and 8.\n- For 400-488, 9 times each.\n\nSo, 4's:3*10 +9=39\n\n8's:3*10 +9=39\n\nSo, yes, 39 each.\n\nSo, the total counts are correct.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I considered all page numbers correctly. The book has pages from 1 to 488, so the three-digit numbers go up to 488, which is correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is that there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n1. **One-digit page numbers (1-9):**\n   - 4 appears once.\n   - 8 appears once.\n\n2. **Two-digit page numbers (10-99):**\n   - Tens place: 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - Units place: 4 and 8 each appear 9 times (once in each set of ten numbers).\n   - Total for two-digit numbers: 4 appears 19 times, 8 appears 19 times.\n\n3. **Three-digit page numbers (100-488):**\n   - Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - Tens place: 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n   - Units place: 4 and 8 each appear 39 times.\n   - Total for three-digit numbers: 4 appears 168 times, 8 appears 78 times.\n\nSumming up all occurrences:\n- Total 4's: 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n- Total 8's: 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\nThe difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " \n\nI'll start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Maybe I can calculate how many times each digit (4 and 8) appears in each place and then compare them.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of 10 consecutive page numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. \n\nTo find the total number of times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide the total number of pages by 10 and then see how many complete groups there are. Since there are 488 pages, dividing by 10 gives me 48 complete groups (because 48 * 10 = 480) and then 8 extra pages (481 to 488). In each of the 48 groups, 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, looking at the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (484). So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place: Each group of 10 has one 8, so 48 times. The extra pages go up to 488, which is a page number ending with 8, so that's one more. So total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, so both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place. That means they're equal here, so no difference yet.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once every 100 numbers. So, for example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. But since the book starts at page 1, the first group is 1-99, which are two-digit numbers, but page 1 is just 1, so maybe I should think in terms of how many times each digit appears in the tens place.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider each hundred block. From 1-99, the tens digits go from 0 (for pages 1-9, but actually, page 1 is just 1, so maybe the tens digit is 0 for pages 1-9). Then from 10-19, the tens digit is 1, and so on up to 90-99 where the tens digit is 9. So in each hundred, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place.\n\nBut since our book goes up to 488, we have four hundreds: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and then 400-488. Wait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so we have 4 complete hundreds (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 400-488.\n\nWait, no, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. Let me correct that: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So that's five segments, but the first one is 1-99, which is 99 pages, then each subsequent hundred is 100 pages, except the last one which is 89 pages (400-488).\n\nWait, actually, 400-488 is 89 pages because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, to calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place, let's go step by step.\n\nFor each hundred block, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? In 1-99, the tens digit is 4 for pages 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, in 100-199, the tens digit is 4 for 140-149, another 10 times. Same for 200-299: 240-249, 10 times. In 300-399: 340-349, 10 times. Now, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 times, but since 488 is less than 449, wait no, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 times. So total 4's in tens place: 10 (1-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 50 times.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is only up to 488, so does 440-449 fall within that? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So yes, 10 times.\n\nNow, for 8's in the tens place: In 1-99, the tens digit is 8 for pages 80-89, which is 10 times. In 100-199: 180-189, 10 times. In 200-299: 280-289, 10 times. In 300-399: 380-389, 10 times. In 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488), so the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 times, not 10. So total 8's in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nSo, 4's in tens place: 50 times, 8's: 49 times. So here, 4's are one more than 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, which is 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them. So that's 89 times.\n\nHow about 8's in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So 8's in hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo, 4's in hundreds place: 89 times, 8's: 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 488 pages. For units digit, each digit 0-9 appears equally except maybe the last partial group. Let me recalculate:\n\nTotal pages: 488\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: 488 // 10 = 48 groups, with 8 remaining pages.\n\nIn each group, 4 appears once in units place, so 48 times. The remaining 8 pages are 481-488, so units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once more (484). So total 49 times for 4's in units.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: 48 groups * 1 = 48, plus in the last 8 pages, 488 ends with 8, so one more, total 49.\n\nSo units place is correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred block contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place. So for 4's in tens place, from 1-99: 10 times (40-49), 100-199: 10 (140-149), 200-299: 10, 300-399: 10, 400-488: 10 (440-449). So 5 times 10, which is 50. That's correct.\n\nFor 8's in tens place: 1-99: 10 (80-89), 100-199: 10 (180-189), 200-299: 10 (280-289), 300-399: 10 (380-389), and 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 pages. So 4 times 10 plus 9, which is 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4's appear from 400-488, which is 89 times, as 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. 8's in hundreds place: 0, correct.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference was 90, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in adding.\n\n49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Correct.\n\n49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nSo 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When I was calculating the units place, I considered 488 as 48 groups of 10, which is 480, plus 8 pages. But actually, 488 is 48 full groups (480) plus 8 pages, so that's correct. So units digits: 48*10 + 8 = 488. So yes, correct.\n\nAnother check: For the tens place, in each hundred, 10 times for each digit, so for 4's, 4 appears 10 times in each hundred block, and there are 5 hundred blocks (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). But wait, 400-488 is not a full hundred, but as we saw, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times in 440-449, which is within 400-488. So 5 times 10 is 50, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, in each full hundred, 10 times, and in the last partial hundred, 9 times, so 4 full hundreds give 40, plus 9, which is 49.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is the fifth segment, so 4 full hundreds (1-399) and then 400-488. So yes, 4 times 10 plus 9 is 49.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total groups of 10: 48 (480 pages) with 8 remaining pages (481-488).\n   - 4 appears once in each group, totaling 48 + 1 (from 484) = 49 times.\n   - 8 appears once in each group, totaling 48 + 1 (from 488) = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times in each block of 100 pages.\n   - 4 appears 10 times in each of the 5 blocks (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), totaling 50 times.\n   - 8 appears 10 times in each of the first 4 blocks and 9 times in the last block (480-488), totaling 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place, so 0 times.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with one-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digits we're interested in are 4 and 8. So, how many 4's are there? Well, just one, which is page 4. Similarly, how many 8's? Just one, page 8. So, in one-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear once each. That means the count difference here is zero.\n\nNext, let's move on to two-digit page numbers, which go from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I think I should consider each place separately.\n\nFirst, for the tens place: How many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Well, from 40 to 49, that's 10 pages. So, 10 times. Similarly, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? From 80 to 89, that's another 10 pages. So, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times in the tens place for two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers. How many times does 4 appear? Well, in each set of ten numbers (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 10 to 99, there are 9 sets of ten, but wait, actually, from 10 to 99, that's 90 numbers, which is 9 sets of ten. But wait, actually, 10-19 is the first set, 20-29 the second, up to 90-99, which is the ninth set. So, in each set, 4 appears once in the units place, so 9 times total. Similarly, 8 appears once in each set, so 9 times as well. Wait, but that can't be right because from 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers, so each digit from 0-9 appears 9 times in the units place, right? So, 4 appears 9 times and 8 appears 9 times in the units place for two-digit numbers.\n\nWait, but hold on, when I count from 10 to 99, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each ten. So, for each ten, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, 9 tens, so 9 times each. So, in the units place, 4 appears 9 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, but earlier, in the tens place, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times each. So, for two-digit numbers, the total count for 4's would be 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. Similarly, for 8's, it's 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. So, in two-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear 19 times each, so again, the difference is zero.\n\nWait, but wait a second, when I was counting the units place, I thought from 10 to 99, there are 9 sets of ten, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 9 each. But actually, from 10 to 99, that's 90 numbers, which is 9 sets of ten. So, yes, 9 times each for units place. So, 10 in tens place and 9 in units place, totaling 19 each. So, two-digit numbers contribute equally to both 4's and 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which in this case go from 100 to 488. So, the page numbers are three digits, with hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nI think I should approach this by considering each digit place separately: hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book has 488 pages. So, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nFirst, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times. How about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place. For three-digit numbers from 100 to 488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 in each hundred. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each, except for the last partial hundred (400-488).\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to break it down into hundreds:\n\n1. 100-199: Here, the hundreds digit is 1. The tens digit can be 0-9, and the units digit can be 0-9. So, for each tens digit, from 0 to 9, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? It's 10 times (pages 140-149). Similarly, 8 appears 10 times (pages 180-189).\n\n2. 200-299: Similarly, the tens digit cycles 0-9, so 4 appears 10 times (240-249), and 8 appears 10 times (280-289).\n\n3. 300-399: Same pattern, 4 appears 10 times (340-349), 8 appears 10 times (380-389).\n\n4. 400-488: Here, the hundreds digit is 4, and the tens digit can be 0-8 because 488 is the last page. So, for the tens digit, from 0 to 8, each digit appears 10 times except for the last one, which is only 9 times because 488 is the end.\n\nWait, actually, let's think about it. From 400 to 488, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. For each tens digit, how many numbers? For tens digits 0-7, each has 10 numbers (e.g., 400-409, 410-419, etc.), but for tens digit 8, it's only 9 numbers (480-488). So, for 4 in the tens place, in 400-488, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, 10 times. Similarly, 8 in the tens place is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place for 400-488, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, but I'm trying to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place across all three-digit numbers. So, for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place. Then, 400-488 contributes 10 times for 4 and 9 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nSo, total for tens place across all three-digit numbers:\n\n4's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 times.\n\n8's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n\nWait, that seems correct because in the last hundred, 400-488, the tens digit 8 only appears 9 times because the last number is 488, not 489.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. For each hundred, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each tens digit. So, in each hundred, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the units place. So, for 4 in the units place, each hundred contributes 10 times. Similarly for 8.\n\nSo, for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the units place. Now, for 400-488, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the units place?\n\nIn 400-488, the units digit can be 0-9 for each tens digit, except for the last one. Let's see, from 400 to 488, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each tens digit from 0 to 8. So, for tens digits 0-7, each has 10 units digits (0-9), so 4 appears 10 times in each, and 8 appears 10 times in each. For tens digit 8, the units digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page), so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). Wait, no, actually, the units digits go from 0 to 8, so 4 appears once, and 8 appears once in the units place for tens digit 8.\n\nWait, let me think again. For 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. For each tens digit from 0 to 7, the units digit cycles 0-9, so 4 appears once per ten, so 8 times (tens digits 0-7) times 1 (units digit 4) = 8 times. Similarly, 8 appears once per ten, so 8 times. Then, for tens digit 8, units digits go from 0 to 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total for 400-488 in units place: 8 + 1 = 9 times for 4, and 8 + 1 = 9 times for 8.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because for each tens digit from 0 to 7, 4 appears once in the units place, so 8 times, and for tens digit 8, 4 appears once. So total 9 times for 4. Similarly, for 8, it's 8 times from tens digits 0-7, and 1 time from tens digit 8, totaling 9 times.\n\nWait, but that's only for 400-488. So, for the units place in three-digit numbers, total count:\n\n4's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n\n8's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n\nWait, but that would mean in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 39 times. But wait, I think I made a mistake here because for 400-488, the units digit for 4 appears 9 times, and similarly for 8, it's 9 times, so adding to the previous 30, that's 39 each.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the units place. So, that's 30 each. Then, from 400-488, 4 appears 9 times and 8 appears 9 times, so total 39 each.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because 400-488 is a partial hundred, so maybe the units digits aren't complete. Let me think again. For each tens digit in 400-488, except for the last one, the units digits go from 0-9, so 4 appears once per ten, and 8 appears once per ten. So, for tens digits 0-7, that's 8 tens digits, each contributing 1 occurrence of 4 and 1 of 8 in the units place, so 8 times each. Then, for tens digit 8, units digits go from 0-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total in 400-488: 8 + 1 = 9 times for 4, and 8 + 1 = 9 times for 8. So, yes, 9 each. So, adding to the previous 30, we get 39 each.\n\nWait, but that would mean in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 39 times. So, in three-digit numbers, the units place contributes 39 each, the tens place contributes 40 for 4 and 39 for 8, and the hundreds place contributes 89 for 4 and 0 for 8.\n\nSo, let's sum up for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n- Tens place: 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n- Units place: 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\nSo, total for three-digit numbers:\n\n4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 times.\n8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78 times.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times because from 400-488, that's 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nIn the tens place, for three-digit numbers:\n\n- 100-199: 10 times 4, 10 times 8.\n- 200-299: 10 times 4, 10 times 8.\n- 300-399: 10 times 4, 10 times 8.\n- 400-488: 10 times 4, 9 times 8.\n\nSo, 4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 times.\n8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nIn the units place:\n\n- 100-199: 10 times 4, 10 times 8.\n- 200-299: 10 times 4, 10 times 8.\n- 300-399: 10 times 4, 10 times 8.\n- 400-488: 9 times 4, 9 times 8.\n\nSo, 4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\nFor 4's: hundreds (89) + tens (40) + units (39) = 89 + 40 = 129 + 39 = 168.\nFor 8's: hundreds (0) + tens (39) + units (39) = 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, 4 appears 168 times, and 8 appears 78 times.\n\nNow, let's add up all the digits from one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nFrom one-digit numbers:\n\n4: 1\n8: 1\n\nFrom two-digit numbers:\n\n4: 19\n8: 19\n\nFrom three-digit numbers:\n\n4: 168\n8: 78\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, I think I might have made a mistake in the units place for 400-488. Let me check again.\n\nIn 400-488, for the units place:\n\n- For tens digits 0-7: each has 10 units digits (0-9), so 4 appears once per ten, so 8 times (tens 0-7) = 8 times.\n- For tens digit 8: units digits go from 0-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n\nSo, total in 400-488 for units place: 8 + 1 = 9 times for 4, and 8 + 1 = 9 times for 8.\n\nSo, in the units place across all three-digit numbers:\n\n4's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n8's: same, 39 times.\n\nSo, that part seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place:\n\n4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 times.\n8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nIn the hundreds place:\n\n4's: 89 times.\n8's: 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nAdding one-digit and two-digit:\n\n4's: 1 + 19 = 20.\n8's: 1 + 19 = 20.\n\nSo, total 4's: 20 + 168 = 188.\nTotal 8's: 20 + 78 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I feel like 90 might be too high. Let me check another way. Maybe I overcounted in the three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, another approach: Instead of breaking it down into hundreds, maybe I can calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each digit place across all page numbers.\n\nTotal pages: 488.\n\nNumber of digits:\n\n- Pages 1-9: 1 digit each, 9 pages.\n- Pages 10-99: 2 digits each, 90 pages.\n- Pages 100-488: 3 digits each, 389 pages.\n\nTotal digits: 9*1 + 90*2 + 389*3 = 9 + 180 + 1167 = 1356 digits.\n\nBut maybe that's not necessary. Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\nFor units digit, in each set of 10 numbers, each digit 0-9 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full sets, with 8 remaining numbers (481-488).\n\nIn each full set of 10, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, 48 sets * 1 = 48 times each.\n\nNow, the remaining 8 numbers: 481-488. Their units digits are 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488).\n\nSo, total units place:\n\n4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that's different from my previous count. Hmm, where did I go wrong before?\n\nWait, earlier I counted 39 times for units place in three-digit numbers, but this method gives 49. So, I must have made a mistake in the earlier approach.\n\nWait, let me think. Using this method, units digits:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48 (from each set of 10) plus 1 (from 484), totaling 49.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears 48 times plus 1 (from 488), totaling 49.\n\nWait, that seems more accurate because it's a straightforward count across all page numbers, regardless of digit places.\n\nSimilarly, let's do the same for tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in each hundred. So, from 1 to 488, how many hundreds?\n\nWe have 4 full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488.\n\nWait, actually, from 1-99, the tens digit cycles 0-9 for each hundred, but 1-99 is two-digit numbers. Wait, perhaps a better approach is:\n\nFor each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, in each hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, from 1-99: two hundreds? Wait, no, 1-99 is actually 1-9 (one-digit) and 10-99 (two-digit). So, perhaps it's better to think in terms of each hundred.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider each digit place separately.\n\nWait, let me try again.\n\nIn the tens place:\n\nFor each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, from 1-99, the tens digits are 0 (for 1-9), 1 (10-19), ..., 9 (90-99). So, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place from 1-99.\n\nSimilarly, from 100-199, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each, so each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSame for 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is not a full hundred, it's 89 numbers. So, let's see.\n\nNumber of full hundreds:\n\n1-99: 99 numbers, but in terms of hundreds, it's the first hundred.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider each hundred as 100 numbers, and then the last partial hundred.\n\nSo:\n\n1-99: tens digits 0-9 each appear 10 times (but actually, for 1-9, tens digit is 0, so 0 appears 9 times, and 1-9 appear once each in the tens place for 10-99. Wait, this is getting confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps using the method where for each digit place, the number of times a digit appears can be calculated as:\n\nFor units place: as I did earlier, 488 // 10 = 48 full cycles, each contributing 1 occurrence of 4 and 8, plus the remainder.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place: 488 // 100 = 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place, plus the remainder.\n\nWait, let me try this formula:\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the tens place up to N is calculated as:\n\nhigher = N // 100\ncurrent = (N // 10) % 10\nlower = N % 10\n\ncount = higher * 10\n\nif current > d:\n    count += 10\nelif current == d:\n    count += lower + 1\n\nSimilarly, for units place, it's simpler: N // 10 * 1 + min(N % 10 + 1, d + 1) if d is in units.\n\nWait, maybe I should use this formula to calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each digit place.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use this formula for each digit place.\n\nLet me try to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears: floor(488 / 10) * 1 + min(488 % 10 - 4 + 1, 0 if 488%10 <4 else 488%10 -4 +1)\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think as:\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N is:\n\ncount = (N // 10) * 1 + (1 if (N % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, for units digit, each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers. So, up to N, the number of times digit d appears in units place is:\n\ncount = (N // 10) * 1 + (1 if (N % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nWait, but that's only if d is 0. Wait, no, actually, it's:\n\ncount = (N // 10) + (1 if (N % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nWait, let me test with N=488 and d=4.\n\nN//10 = 48, so 48 times. Then, N%10 = 8, which is >=4, so add 1. So, total 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8:\n\nN//10 = 48, N%10=8 >=8, so add 1. Total 49 times.\n\nSo, units place: 4 appears 49 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, tens place:\n\nUsing the formula for tens digit:\n\ncount = (N // 100) * 10 + ( (N % 100) // 10 >= d ? 10 : 0 ) + (if (N % 100) //10 == d, then (N % 10) +1 else 0 )\n\nWait, perhaps more accurately:\n\nFor tens digit, the count is:\n\nhigher = N // 100\ncurrent = (N // 10) % 10\nlower = N % 10\n\ncount = higher * 10\n\nif current > d:\n    count += 10\nelif current == d:\n    count += lower + 1\n\nSo, for d=4 and N=488:\n\nhigher = 488 // 100 = 4\ncurrent = (488 // 10) % 10 = 48 %10 = 8\nlower = 488 %10 = 8\n\ncount = 4 * 10 = 40\n\nSince current (8) > d (4), count +=10 \u2192 50.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because from 1-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 10-19, 110-119, ..., 400-409, etc.\n\nWait, let me test this formula with d=4 and N=488.\n\nhigher = 4 (since 488 //100 =4)\ncurrent = (488 //10) %10 =48%10=8\nlower=8\n\ncount =4*10=40\n\nSince current (8) >4, add 10 \u2192 total 50.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8:\n\nhigher=4\ncurrent=8\nlower=8\n\ncount=4*10=40\n\nSince current=8 >=8, add lower+1=8+1=9 \u2192 total 40+9=49.\n\nWait, but that seems inconsistent. Let me check with a smaller N.\n\nFor example, N=48.\n\nhigher=0\ncurrent=(48//10)%10=4\nlower=8\n\ncount=0*10=0\n\nSince current=4 >=4, add lower+1=8+1=9 \u2192 total 9.\n\nBut in reality, from 1-48, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-48, which is 9 times (40-48 inclusive). So, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8 in N=48:\n\nhigher=0\ncurrent=(48//10)%10=4\nlower=8\n\nSince current=4 <8, count=0*10=0.\n\nSo, 8's in tens place from 1-48: 0 times, which is correct because the tens digit 8 would start at 80, which is beyond 48.\n\nWait, but in N=88:\n\nhigher=0\ncurrent=8\nlower=8\n\ncount=0*10=0\n\nSince current=8 >=8, add lower+1=8+1=9 \u2192 total 9.\n\nWhich is correct because from 1-88, the tens digit 8 appears in 80-88, which is 9 times.\n\nWait, so applying this to N=488 for d=4:\n\ncount=4*10=40\n\ncurrent=8 >4 \u2192 add 10 \u2192 total 50.\n\nSo, 4 appears 50 times in the tens place.\n\nFor d=8:\n\ncount=4*10=40\n\ncurrent=8 >=8 \u2192 add lower+1=8+1=9 \u2192 total 49.\n\nSo, 8 appears 49 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nFor hundreds digit, d=4 and d=8.\n\nFor d=4:\n\nIn N=488, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 4 appears 89 times.\n\nFor d=8:\n\nIn N=488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so 0 times.\n\nSo, now, summing up:\n\nUnits place: 49 each.\n\nTens place: 50 for 4, 49 for 8.\n\nHundreds place: 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, so this matches my earlier count. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, earlier when I was calculating the units place using the first method, I got 39 for three-digit numbers, but using this formula, I get 49. So, I think the formula is more accurate because it accounts for all page numbers, not just three-digit ones.\n\nSo, to confirm, using the formula:\n\n- Units place: 49 each.\n- Tens place: 50 for 4, 49 for 8.\n- Hundreds place: 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting '4's and '8's in Each Digit Place:**\n\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n     - Up to 488, there are 48 full sets of 10, contributing 48 each.\n     - Remainder (481-488) adds one more '4' (484) and one more '8' (488).\n     - **Total:** 49 each.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in each hundred.\n     - Up to 488, there are 4 full hundreds, contributing 40 each.\n     - For '4': The tens digit is 4 in 400-409, adding 10 more.\n     - For '8': The tens digit is 8 in 480-488, adding 9 more.\n     - **Total:** '4' appears 50 times, '8' appears 49 times.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - '4' appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n     - '8' never appears in the hundreds place.\n     - **Total:** '4' = 89, '8' = 0.\n\n2. **Summing Up:**\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That makes sense because the number of times a digit appears in each place can be calculated individually. So, let me start by considering each place one by one.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears once, and so does the digit 8. \n\nNow, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, there are 48 complete groups and then 8 extra pages (from 481 to 488). \n\nSo, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times (once in each group of 10) plus one more time in the extra pages because 484 has a 4 in the units place. Wait, no, 484 is part of the 480-489 range, but actually, the extra pages go up to 488, so in the units place, the 4 appears once more at 484. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, it appears once in each group of 10, so 48 times, and in the extra pages, 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that seems like the same number, but I might be making a mistake here. Let me check again. From 1 to 480, each group of 10 contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 times each. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 481, 482, ..., 488. So, 484 has a 4, and 488 has an 8. So, yes, each gets one more, making it 49 each in the units place. So, units place contributes 49 4's and 49 8's, so no difference there.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in a group of 100. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), then 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), etc., up to 9 (90-99). So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for every 100 numbers.\n\nSo, for the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see. Each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, for each hundred, that's 10 times. Now, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, from 1 to 400, there are 4 hundreds. Each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, so the 40-49 range is from 400-409, but wait, 400 is already counted in the hundreds. Wait, no, 400 is part of the 400-499 range, but in our case, we're only going up to 488. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 0 (400-409), 1 (410-419), up to 8 (480-488). So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in 400-409, which is 10 times, but since we're only going up to 488, 400-409 is entirely within 488, right? Wait, no, 400-409 is 10 numbers, but 488 is much higher. Wait, actually, no, 400-409 is just part of the 400-499 range, but since our book ends at 488, we have to check if 400-409 is entirely within 488. It is, because 409 is less than 488. So, in the tens place, from 400-488, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (400-409). So, total tens place 4's are 40 (from 1-400) plus 10 (from 400-409) = 50? Wait, that can't be right because 400-409 is part of the 400-499 range, which is the fourth hundred. Wait, maybe I'm overcounting. Let me think again.\n\nWait, from 1-99, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, which is 10 times. From 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10 times. From 200-299, 240-249, another 10. From 300-399, 340-349, another 10. So that's 4*10=40 times. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 400-409, which is another 10 times. But wait, 400-409 is part of the 400-499 range, but our book ends at 488, so 400-409 is entirely included. So, that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place. From 1-99, it's 80-89, which is 10 times. From 100-199, 180-189, another 10. From 200-299, 280-289, another 10. From 300-399, 380-389, another 10. So that's 4*10=40 times. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times because 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 times. Therefore, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times. So, the difference here is 50 - 49 = 1 more 4 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nThe digit 8 in the hundreds place would appear in pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times, and 8's appear 0 times. So, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the differences from each place.\n\nUnits place: 49 4's vs 49 8's \u2192 difference 0.\n\nTens place: 50 4's vs 49 8's \u2192 difference +1.\n\nHundreds place: 89 4's vs 0 8's \u2192 difference +89.\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times the hundreds digit is 4. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, from 400-409, that's 10 times 4, and from 480-488, that's 9 times 8. So, tens place 4's: 50, 8's:49. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 49 each, so no difference. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: units 49 + tens 50 + hundreds 89 = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: units 49 + tens 49 + hundreds 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the tens place. From 400-488, the tens digit 4 is in 400-409, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. From 1-400, the tens digit 4 appears 4 times 10, which is 40. So, total 50, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place, from 1-400, it's 4 times 10, which is 40. Then from 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, total 49. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nNumber of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total groups of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full groups and 8 extra pages (481-488).\n   - '4' appears once per group: 48 times + 1 (484) = 49.\n   - '8' appears once per group: 48 times + 1 (488) = 49.\n   - Difference in units place: 49 - 49 = 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - From 1-400: 40 occurrences of '4' and 40 of '8'.\n   - From 401-488: '4' appears 10 times (400-409), '8' appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total '4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total '8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n   - Difference in tens place: 50 - 49 = 1.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - '4' appears in pages 400-488: 89 times.\n   - '8' appears 0 times as the book ends at 488.\n   - Difference in hundreds place: 89 - 0 = 89.\n\n**Total Difference:**\n- Units: 0\n- Tens: +1\n- Hundreds: +89\n- **Total:** 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with one-digit page numbers, that would be from 1 to 9. In this range, the digit 4 appears once (which is page 4) and the digit 8 also appears once (page 8). So, the count here is 1 four and 1 eight, meaning no difference yet.\n\nNext, I'll move on to two-digit page numbers, which go from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I should calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in each position.\n\nFor the tens place in two-digit numbers:\n- The digit 4 appears in the tens place for pages 40 to 49. That's 10 times (40, 41, ..., 49).\n- The digit 8 appears in the tens place for pages 80 to 89. That's another 10 times.\n\nFor the units place in two-digit numbers:\n- The digit 4 appears in the units place once every ten numbers, so from 10 to 99, that's 9 times (14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94). Wait, but 44 is already counted in the tens place, but since we're counting units place separately, it's still 9 times.\n- Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the units place 9 times (18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98).\n\nSo, in two-digit numbers, 4 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times, and 8 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times. So, again, no difference here.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which go from 100 to 488. These are a bit more complex because each page number has a hundreds place, a tens place, and a units place. I need to calculate the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each position within this range.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place:\n- The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit 4 only goes up to page 488, not 499.\n- The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). So, 89 times for the hundreds place.\n- The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the highest page number is 488, and the hundreds digit is 4.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers:\n- The tens digit can be 0 to 9. I need to find how many times 4 and 8 appear here.\n- For the digit 4 in the tens place, the pages would be from X40 to X49, where X is the hundreds digit. But since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. However, when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can only go up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times each (140-149, 240-249, 340-349). For the hundreds digit 4, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 pages. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is fully included. So, total for 4 in the tens place: 3*10 + 10 = 40 times.\n- Similarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place, the pages would be X80 to X89. For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, this is 10 each (180-189, 280-289, 380-389). For hundreds digit 4, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 9 pages (480-488). So, total for 8 in the tens place: 3*10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers:\n- The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each tens and hundreds combination.\n- For the digit 4 in the units place, in each set of ten pages (like 100-109, 110-119, etc.), 4 appears once in the units place. So, how many sets of ten are there from 100 to 488? Let's see: from 100 to 488, that's 489 - 100 + 1 = 389 pages. Divided by 10, that's 38 full sets and 9 extra pages (480-488). So, in each full set, 4 appears once, so 38 times. Plus, in the last partial set (480-488), does 4 appear? Yes, at 484. So, total 38 + 1 = 39 times for 4 in the units place.\n- For the digit 8 in the units place, similarly, each set of ten has one 8 in the units place. So, same calculation: 38 full sets and 9 extra pages. In the full sets, 38 times. In the last partial set (480-488), 8 appears at 488. So, total 38 + 1 = 39 times for 8 in the units place.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. From 100 to 488, the number of units digits is indeed 389 numbers. So, 389 / 10 = 38 full cycles, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 38 each. Then, the remaining 9 numbers (480-488) have units digits from 0 to 8. So, 484 has a 4, and 488 has an 8. So, that's one more 4 and one more 8, making it 39 each. So, both 4 and 8 appear 39 times in the units place.\n\nPutting it all together for three-digit numbers:\n- 4 appears 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168 times.\n- 8 appears 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78 times.\n\nWait, let me check the tens place for 4 again. Earlier, I thought it was 40 times. Let me recount. For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, each has a 4 in the tens place for 10 pages each, so 3*10=30. Then, for hundreds digit 4, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, 30 + 10 = 40. That's correct.\n\nFor the tens place of 8, hundreds digits 1,2,3 each have 10 pages (X80-X89), so 3*10=30. Then, for hundreds digit 4, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 30 + 9 = 39. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 38 full sets (100-488 is 389 numbers, so 38*10=380, plus 9). So, 38 full sets contribute 38 each for 4 and 8. Then, the last 9 numbers (480-488) have 484 (units 4) and 488 (units 8), so 1 each. So, 38+1=39 each. Correct.\n\nSo, three-digit numbers contribute 168 fours and 78 eights.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the digits from one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nOne-digit:\n- 4: 1\n- 8: 1\n\nTwo-digit:\n- 4: 19\n- 8: 19\n\nThree-digit:\n- 4: 168\n- 8: 78\n\nTotal:\n- 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n- 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the three-digit counts again because that's where most of the numbers are.\n\nHundreds place for 4: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct.\n\nTens place for 4: 10 per hundred for hundreds 1,2,3, so 30, plus 10 for 440-449, total 40. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 4: 38 full sets (100-488 has 389 numbers, which is 38 full tens and 9 extra). Each full set contributes one 4, so 38. Plus, in the last 9 numbers (480-488), 484 has a 4, so total 39. Correct.\n\nSimilarly for 8's in tens place: 3*10=30, plus 9 in 480-488, total 39.\n\nUnits place for 8's: 38 full sets, plus 488, so 39. Correct.\n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 fours.\n\nAnd for 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nAdding one-digit and two-digit:\n\n4's: 1 + 19 = 20, plus 168 = 188.\n\n8's: 1 + 19 = 20, plus 78 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to 8's. \n\n1. **One-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - 4 appears once (page 4).\n   - 8 appears once (page 8).\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears 9 times (14, 24, ..., 94), 8 appears 9 times (18, 28, ..., 98).\n   - Total: 19 fours, 19 eights.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n   - Total: 168 fours, 78 eights.\n\n4. **Total counts:**\n   - **4's:** 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n   - **8's:** 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with one-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digits 4 and 8 each appear once. So, for one-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 occur once. That means the count for 4 is 1 and for 8 is also 1. So, the difference here is zero. \n\nNext, I'll move on to two-digit page numbers, which go from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I need to calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place separately.\n\nFor the tens place in two-digit numbers, 4 can appear in the tens position for the numbers 40 to 49, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 can appear in the tens position for 80 to 89, also 10 times. \n\nNow, looking at the units place for two-digit numbers, 4 can appear in the units place once every ten numbers, like 4, 14, 24, ..., 94. That's 9 times because from 10 to 99, each ten has one 4 in the units place, and there are 9 tens (10-99). Wait, actually, from 10 to 99, that's 90 numbers, so 90 divided by 10 is 9 occurrences. Similarly, 8 in the units place would also occur 9 times, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 98. \n\nWait, but hold on, when I'm considering two-digit numbers, the units place for 4 would actually be from 10 to 99, so numbers like 14, 24, ..., 94. That's 9 numbers because 10 is the start, so 14 is the first occurrence, and 94 is the last, which is 9 times. Same for 8 in the units place, 18, 28, ..., 98, which is also 9 times. \n\nSo, adding up the tens and units places for two-digit numbers, 4 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times, and 8 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times. So, again, the difference is zero here. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which range from 100 to 488. Each three-digit number has a hundreds place, a tens place, and a units place. I need to calculate the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each position.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place, 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. Let me see how many numbers that is. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can't be 8 because that would start at 800, which is beyond 488. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all in three-digit numbers. \n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. Let's break this down. The tens digit can be from 0 to 9, and we need to find how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place across all three-digit page numbers from 100 to 488.\n\nFirst, for 4 in the tens place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But wait, when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can only go up to 8 because the maximum page number is 488. So, let me handle this in two parts: hundreds digits from 1 to 3, and then hundreds digit 4.\n\nFor hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each of these can have a tens digit of 4, and the units digit can be from 0 to 9. So, for each hundreds digit (1, 2, 3), there are 10 possibilities for the units digit when the tens digit is 4. That gives 3 * 10 = 30 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nNow, for hundreds digit 4: The tens digit can be 0 to 8, but since we're looking for 4, the tens digit is 4, and the units digit can be from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the maximum). So, how many numbers have 4 in the tens place when the hundreds digit is 4? The units digit can be 0 to 8, which is 9 possibilities. So, that's 9 occurrences.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in the tens place are 30 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nNow, for 8 in the tens place in three-digit numbers. Again, hundreds digits can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nFor hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each can have a tens digit of 8, and the units digit can be 0 to 9. So, that's 3 * 10 = 30 occurrences.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4: The tens digit can be 0 to 8, so when the tens digit is 8, the units digit can be 0 to 8 (since 488 is the maximum). So, that's 9 possibilities, as the units digit can be 0 to 8, making 9 numbers (480 to 488, but only up to 488). Wait, but 488 is included, so 480, 481, ..., 488 is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 occurrences.\n\nTherefore, total 8's in the tens place are 30 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, but wait a minute, when the hundreds digit is 4 and the tens digit is 8, the maximum units digit is 8, so that's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, yes, 9 occurrences.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. Let's calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in the units place from 100 to 488.\n\nStarting with 4 in the units place. For each hundreds digit (1, 2, 3, 4), and each tens digit (0-9), the units digit can be 4. So, for hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each has 10 possible tens digits, and for each, the units digit can be 4 once. So, that's 3 * 10 = 30 occurrences.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4: The tens digits can be 0 to 8, because 488 is the maximum. So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, the units digit can be 4 once. That's 9 occurrences (tens digits 0 to 8). So, total 4's in the units place are 30 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nNow, for 8 in the units place. Similarly, for hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each has 10 possible tens digits, and for each, the units digit can be 8 once. So, that's 3 * 10 = 30 occurrences.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4: The tens digits can be 0 to 8, so for each tens digit, the units digit can be 8 once. That's 9 occurrences (tens digits 0 to 8). So, total 8's in the units place are 30 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, but wait, when the hundreds digit is 4 and the tens digit is 8, the units digit can be 8, but does that go up to 488? Yes, 488 is included, so units digit 8 is allowed. So, yes, that's 9 times.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. For hundreds digit 4, tens digit 8, units digits can be 0 to 8, so 8 is included, making 488. So, yes, 9 times.\n\nSo, summarizing the three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4 in hundreds place: 89 times\n- 4 in tens place: 39 times\n- 4 in units place: 39 times\nTotal 4's: 89 + 39 + 39 = 167 times\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- 8 in hundreds place: 0 times\n- 8 in tens place: 39 times\n- 8 in units place: 39 times\nTotal 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78 times\n\nWait, that seems off because earlier in two-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 had 19 each, and in one-digit numbers, 1 each, so let's check again.\n\nWait, no, in one-digit numbers, 4 and 8 each appear once. In two-digit numbers, both appear 19 times each. So, up to two-digit numbers, 4's are 1 + 19 = 20, and 8's are 1 + 19 = 20. Then, in three-digit numbers, 4's are 167 and 8's are 78. So, total 4's would be 20 + 167 = 187, and 8's would be 20 + 78 = 98. So, the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in the hundreds place for 4. Let me recheck that.\n\nThe hundreds digit for 4 is from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nFor 8 in the hundreds place, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can't be 8, so 0 times. Correct.\n\nNow, for the tens place in three-digit numbers:\n\n4 in tens place: For hundreds digits 1,2,3: Each has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so 3*10=30. For hundreds digit 4: The tens digit can be 4, but the units digit can only go up to 8, so 9 numbers (440 to 448, but wait, no, that's not right. Wait, when hundreds digit is 4, tens digit is 4, and units digit can be 0-9, but wait, the maximum page is 488, so when hundreds digit is 4 and tens digit is 4, units can go up to 9, right? Wait, 449 is less than 488, so units can go up to 9. So, that's 10 numbers: 440 to 449. Wait, so earlier I thought it was 9, but actually, it's 10.\n\nWait, this is a mistake. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, for hundreds digit 4, when the tens digit is 4, the units digit can be 0-9, making 10 numbers: 440, 441, ..., 449. So, that's 10 occurrences, not 9. So, total 4's in the tens place would be 3*10 + 10 = 40 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place: For hundreds digits 1,2,3: Each has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so 3*10=30. For hundreds digit 4: The tens digit can be 8, and the units digit can be 0-8, because 488 is the maximum. So, units digits 0-8, which is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's 9 occurrences. So, total 8's in the tens place are 30 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, so that changes the count. So, for 4's in the tens place, it's 30 (from 1-3) + 10 (from 4) = 40 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, it's 30 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nNow, moving to the units place in three-digit numbers.\n\nFor 4 in the units place: For hundreds digits 1,2,3: Each has 10 tens digits, and for each, the units digit can be 4 once, so 3*10=30. For hundreds digit 4: The tens digits can be 0-8, and for each, the units digit can be 4 once. Wait, but when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can go up to 8, but the units digit can be 4 regardless of the tens digit, right? So, for hundreds digit 4, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It would be 9 times (tens digits 0-8) because when the tens digit is 8, the units digit can be up to 8, so 4 is allowed. So, that's 9 times. So, total 4's in the units place: 30 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nFor 8 in the units place: Similarly, for hundreds digits 1,2,3: Each has 10 tens digits, so 3*10=30. For hundreds digit 4: The tens digits can be 0-8, and for each, the units digit can be 8 once, so that's 9 times. So, total 8's in the units place: 30 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nNow, let's recalculate the total counts.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89\n- Tens place: 40\n- Units place: 39\nTotal: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 times\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0\n- Tens place: 39\n- Units place: 39\nTotal: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78 times\n\nNow, adding in the one-digit and two-digit numbers:\n\nOne-digit numbers: 4 appears once, 8 appears once.\nTwo-digit numbers: 4 appears 19 times, 8 appears 19 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 1 + 19 + 168 = 188 times\nTotal 8's: 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 1 + 19 + 78 = 98 times\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 89, but after correcting the tens place for 4's in three-digit numbers, it's 90. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, let's recount the three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times\n- Tens place: 4 appears 40 times\n- Units place: 4 appears 39 times\nTotal: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n\n8's:\n\n- Tens place: 39\n- Units place: 39\nTotal: 78\n\nAdding one-digit and two-digit:\n\n4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, so the correct difference is 90. I think I made a mistake earlier when I thought the tens place for 4's in three-digit numbers was 39, but it's actually 40. So, the correct answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 4's in three-digit numbers again. When hundreds digit is 4, tens digit is 4, units digit can be 0-9, which is 10 numbers: 440 to 449. So, that's 10 occurrences, not 9. So, yes, 3*10=30 from hundreds digits 1-3, plus 10 from hundreds digit 4, totaling 40. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place when hundreds digit is 4, tens digit 8, units digits can be 0-8, which is 9 numbers: 480 to 488. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **One-Digit Page Numbers (1-9):**\n   - 4 appears once.\n   - 8 appears once.\n   - Difference: 0.\n\n2. **Two-Digit Page Numbers (10-99):**\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - 4 appears 10 times (40-49).\n     - 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - 4 appears 9 times (14, 24, ..., 94).\n     - 8 appears 9 times (18, 28, ..., 98).\n   - **Total for Two-Digit:**\n     - 4: 10 + 9 = 19.\n     - 8: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Difference: 0.**\n\n3. **Three-Digit Page Numbers (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n     - 8 does not appear.\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - 4 appears 40 times (30 from 100-399, 10 from 400-449).\n     - 8 appears 39 times (30 from 100-399, 9 from 480-488).\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - 4 appears 39 times (30 from 100-399, 9 from 400-488).\n     - 8 appears 39 times (30 from 100-399, 9 from 400-488).\n   - **Total for Three-Digit:**\n     - 4: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n     - 8: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n   - **Difference: 168 - 78 = 90.**\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **4's:** 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n   - **8's:** 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n   - **Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, I'll probably need to analyze each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place one by one. Maybe I can calculate how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and then do the same for 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, in every block of 10 consecutive pages, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times a specific digit appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then considering any remainder.\n\nSo, for the units place, the number of 4's would be the number of complete tens in 488, which is 48 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete tens), plus 1 if the units digit is 4 or higher. Wait, actually, no. Since each ten contributes exactly one 4 in the units place, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 times 1, which is 48. Similarly, for 8's, it's also 48 times 1, which is 48. But wait, does 488 include an extra 4 or 8 in the units place? Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so the units digit cycles up to 8. So, in the last partial block, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial block, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 (from the complete tens) plus 1 (from the partial block), totaling 49. Similarly, the number of 8's in the units place is 48 plus 1, which is also 49. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. That means there's no difference in the units place.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages, with each digit from 0 to 9 appearing 10 times in each hundred. So, for the tens place, each digit appears 10 times per hundred. So, in 488 pages, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), so for 4 hundreds, that's 4 times 10, which is 40. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times per hundred, so 4 times 10 is 40.\n\nNow, for the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digit cycles through 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does each appear?\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit cycles as follows:\n\n- 0: 401-410 (10 pages)\n- 1: 411-420 (10 pages)\n- 2: 421-430 (10 pages)\n- 3: 431-440 (10 pages)\n- 4: 441-450 (10 pages)\n- 5: 451-460 (10 pages)\n- 6: 461-470 (10 pages)\n- 7: 471-480 (10 pages)\n- 8: 481-488 (8 pages)\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so from 481-488, that's 8 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in this incomplete hundred. So, for the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times (in 441-450), and the digit 8 appears 8 times (in 481-488). Therefore, in the incomplete hundred, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, total for the tens place:\n\n- 4's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from incomplete) = 50\n- 8's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 8 (from incomplete) = 48\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 48 times. That's a difference of 2 more 4's than 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit changes every 100 pages. In a 488-page book, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. But wait, actually, page numbers start at 1, so the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does each hundreds digit appear?\n\n- 0: pages 1-99 (99 pages)\n- 1: pages 100-199 (100 pages)\n- 2: pages 200-299 (100 pages)\n- 3: pages 300-399 (100 pages)\n- 4: pages 400-488 (89 pages)\n\nWait, 400 to 488 is 89 pages because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nNow, we're interested in when the hundreds digit is 4 or 8. But looking at the hundreds digits, 8 never appears as a hundreds digit in a 488-page book because the highest hundreds digit is 4 (for 400-488). So, the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place. On the other hand, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all pages from 400 to 488, which is 89 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nThat's a difference of 89 more 4's than 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each digit place.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\n- 4's: 49\n- 8's: 49\n\nTens place:\n\n- 4's: 50\n- 8's: 48\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nAdding them up:\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 97.\n\nThe difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place: 488 pages. Each ten contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 complete tens, each contributing 1, so 48 each. Then, the last partial ten from 481-488: units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds contribute 40 each for 4 and 8. Then, the incomplete hundred from 401-488: tens digits go from 0 to 8. For 4's in tens place, it's 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. For 8's, it's 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, total tens place: 4's = 40 + 10 = 50, 8's = 40 + 8 = 48. That looks right.\n\nHundreds place: Only the pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, which is 89 pages. 8 never appears in the hundreds place, so 0. So, 4's: 89, 8's: 0. Correct.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nHmm, 91 seems correct based on this calculation. But let me think again if I missed anything.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Pages 400-488: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. That's correct.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a more systematic approach.\n\nFor each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nNumber of complete cycles of 10 in 488 pages: floor(488 / 10) = 48 cycles. Each cycle contributes 1 occurrence of each digit 0-9 in the units place, so 48 occurrences of 4 and 48 of 8. Then, the remainder is 488 % 10 = 8, so the units digits go from 1 to 8 in the last partial cycle. In this partial cycle, 4 appears once (at 4) and 8 appears once (at 8). So, total units: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of complete cycles of 100 in 488: floor(488 / 100) = 4 cycles. Each cycle contributes 10 occurrences of each digit 0-9 in the tens place, so 4*10 = 40 for 4 and 40 for 8. Then, the remainder is 488 % 100 = 88. So, the tens digits go from 0 to 8 in the incomplete cycle. For each tens digit d from 0 to 8, the number of times it appears is 10 if d < 8, and 9 if d = 8? Wait, no. Wait, 401-488: the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490, but only up to 488). So, for each tens digit d from 0 to 8, the number of pages is:\n\n- d = 0: 401-410 \u2192 10 pages\n- d = 1: 411-420 \u2192 10 pages\n- ...\n- d = 7: 471-480 \u2192 10 pages\n- d = 8: 481-488 \u2192 8 pages\n\nSo, for the incomplete cycle, the digit 4 in the tens place appears once (when d=4), which is 441-450, which is 10 pages. Similarly, digit 8 in the tens place appears when d=8, which is 481-488, 8 pages.\n\nSo, total tens place:\n\n4's: 4*10 + 10 = 50\n8's: 4*10 + 8 = 48\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumber of complete cycles of 1000 in 488: floor(488 / 1000) = 0, so no complete cycles. The hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. Digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only has 488 pages, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8.\n\nThus, hundreds place:\n\n4's: 89\n8's: 0\n\nAdding up all positions:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nSo, I think 91 is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations now.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Complete tens: 48 (488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete tens).\n   - Each digit appears 48 times in the units place.\n   - Remainder: 8 pages (481-488), where 4 and 8 each appear once.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Complete hundreds: 4 (488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds).\n   - Each digit appears 40 times in the tens place.\n   - Remainder: 88 pages (401-488), where:\n     - 4 appears 10 times (441-450).\n     - 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 8 = 48\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0.\n   - Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1.\n   - Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2.\n   - Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3.\n   - Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4 (89 pages).\n   - 4 appears 89 times; 8 never appears.\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 97 = 91\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by understanding how many digits each page number has. Pages 1 to 9 are single-digit numbers, pages 10 to 99 are two-digit, and pages 100 to 488 are three-digit. So, I can divide the problem into these three parts and count the number of 4's and 8's in each part separately.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers (1-9). Here, the digits possible are from 1 to 9. The number 4 appears once (page 4), and the number 8 appears once (page 8). So, in single-digit pages, the count for 4 is 1 and for 8 is 1. The difference here is 0.\n\nNext, moving on to two-digit page numbers (10-99). Each two-digit number has a tens place and a units place. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in the two-digit numbers. \n\nIn the tens place: The numbers 40 to 49 all have a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 fours. \n\nIn the units place: The numbers 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94 have a 4 in the units place. That's 9 numbers because 44 was already counted in the tens place, but wait, no, actually, each occurrence is separate. Wait, no, in the units place, each digit is considered separately, so 14, 24, ..., 94 is 9 numbers, each contributing one 4. So, that's 9 fours. \n\nWait, but 44 has two 4's, so when counting the tens place, we have 10 fours, and in the units place, 9 fours, but 44 is counted twice. So, in total, the number of 4's in two-digit numbers is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. But wait, does that include 44 twice? Let me check. For the tens place, 44 is included in the 10, and for the units place, 44 is included in the 9, so yes, 44 contributes two 4's, so the total is indeed 19.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should think differently. The total number of 4's in two-digit numbers is the number of times 4 appears in the tens place plus the number of times it appears in the units place. So, for the tens place, it's 10 (40-49), and for the units place, it's 9 (14,24,...,94), so total 19.\n\nSimilarly, for the number 8's in two-digit numbers:\n\nIn the tens place: 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 eights.\n\nIn the units place: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8. So, 9 eights.\n\nAgain, 88 is included in both counts, so total eights in two-digit numbers are 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nWait, but that's the same as 4's. So, in two-digit numbers, both 4's and 8's appear 19 times each. So, the difference in two-digit numbers is 0.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which go from 100 to 488. So, each three-digit number has hundreds, tens, and units places. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nLet's start with the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book has 488 pages, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4.\n\nFirst, for the hundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\n- 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the hundreds digit is 8, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers (100-488). Let's count how many times 4 and 8 appear here.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\n- For 4's: The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.). But since the book goes up to 488, we need to check how many complete hundreds we have and whether the last hundred has a full set.\n\nWait, the hundreds digits go from 1 to 4. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, for hundreds 1, 2, 3, and 4, each contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 fours in the tens place.\n\nBut wait, for the 400-488 range, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (440-449), and then 450-488 would have tens digits beyond 4, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is the only set where the tens digit is 4 in the 400s. So, that's 10 fours.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. But 400-488 isn't a full hundred; it's 89 numbers. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit goes up to 8, so the tens digit 4 occurs once, from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total fours in the tens place across all three-digit numbers would be 3 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each contributing 10 fours, plus the 400-488 range contributing another 10 fours. So, 3\u00d710 + 10 = 40 fours in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place:\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (e.g., 180-189, 280-289, etc.). So, for hundreds 1, 2, 3, each contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Now, for the 400-488 range, the tens digit can go up to 8, so 480-489 would have tens digit 8, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times.\n\nSo, total eights in the tens place would be 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30 eights, plus 9 eights in the 400-488 range, totaling 39 eights.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. For hundreds 1, 2, 3, each has 10 eights in the tens place, so 3\u00d710=30. For the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 eights. Thus, total eights in the tens place: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers (100-488). Let's count how many times 4 and 8 appear here.\n\nFor 4's in the units place:\n\nIn each hundred, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so in each hundred, the units digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 104,114,...,194). So, for hundreds 1, 2, 3, each contributes 10 fours in the units place. Now, for the 400-488 range, the units digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. Wait, that's 9 numbers because 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, but 494 would be beyond 488. Wait, no, 404,414,...,484: that's from 404 to 484, stepping by 10, which is 9 numbers (since (484 - 404)/10 + 1 = 9). So, 9 fours in the units place for the 400-488 range.\n\nThus, total fours in the units place: 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30, plus 9 in the 400-488 range, totaling 39 fours.\n\nFor 8's in the units place:\n\nSimilarly, in each hundred, the units digit is 8 for 10 numbers (e.g., 108,118,...,198). So, for hundreds 1, 2, 3, each contributes 10 eights in the units place, totaling 3\u00d710=30.\n\nIn the 400-488 range, the units digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. Wait, that's 9 numbers because 488 is included, so from 408 to 488, stepping by 10, which is (488 - 408)/10 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, 9 eights in the units place for the 400-488 range.\n\nThus, total eights in the units place: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but let me check: in the 400-488 range, the units digit 8 occurs at 408,418,...,488, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page. So, yes, 9 eights.\n\nNow, let me summarize the counts for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0\n- Tens place: 4's = 40, 8's = 39\n- Units place: 4's = 39, 8's = 39\n\nWait, hold on, earlier I thought that for the tens place, 4's were 40 and 8's were 39. Similarly, units place for both 4's and 8's were 39 each.\n\nSo, adding up all three places for three-digit numbers:\n\nTotal 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n\nTotal 8's in three-digit numbers: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me double-check.\n\nHundreds place: 4's from 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nTens place: 4's in tens digit across all three-digit numbers: 3 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each contribute 10 fours in the tens place, so 3\u00d710=30. Plus, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So, total 30+10=40 fours in the tens place.\n\nUnits place: 4's in units digit: for each hundred, 10 fours, so 3 hundreds \u00d710=30. Plus, in 400-488, units digit 4 occurs 9 times (404,414,...,484), so 9. Total 30+9=39.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTens place: 3 hundreds \u00d710=30 eights, plus in 400-488, tens digit 8 occurs 9 times (480-488), so 30+9=39.\n\nUnits place: 3 hundreds \u00d710=30 eights, plus in 400-488, units digit 8 occurs 9 times (408,418,...,488), so 30+9=39.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place, 8's don't appear, so total 78.\n\nSo, total 4's across all page numbers:\n\nSingle-digit:1, two-digit:19, three-digit:168. So, total 1+19+168=188.\n\nTotal 8's across all page numbers:\n\nSingle-digit:1, two-digit:19, three-digit:78. So, total 1+19+78=98.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with single-digit:\n\n4's:1, 8's:1.\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n4's:19, 8's:19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\n4's:89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (units) = 168.\n\n8's:0 (hundreds) +39 (tens) +39 (units) =78.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's:1+19+168=188.\n\n8's:1+19+78=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the three-digit counts again because 168 seems high.\n\nIn three-digit numbers, from 100 to 488:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4's from 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\n- Tens place: 4's: in each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers each, so 3\u00d710=30. Plus, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 30+10=40 fours.\n\n- Units place: 4's: in each hundred, units digit 4 occurs 10 times, so 3\u00d710=30. Plus, in 400-488, units digit 4 occurs at 404,414,...,484, which is 9 times. So, 30+9=39 fours.\n\nSo, 89+40+39=168 fours in three-digit numbers.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\n- Tens place: in each of the first three hundreds, tens digit 8 occurs 10 times, so 3\u00d710=30. In 400-488, tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 30+9=39 eights.\n\n- Units place: in each of the first three hundreds, units digit 8 occurs 10 times, so 3\u00d710=30. In 400-488, units digit 8 occurs at 408,418,...,488, which is 9 numbers. So, 30+9=39 eights.\n\nTotal 8's:39+39=78.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, total 4's:188, 8's:98, difference 90.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - 4 appears once (page 4).\n   - 8 appears once (page 8).\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - 4's: 10 in tens place (40-49) + 9 in units place (14,24,...,94) = 19.\n   - 8's: 10 in tens place (80-89) + 9 in units place (18,28,...,98) = 19.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **4's:**\n     - Hundreds place: 89 times (400-488).\n     - Tens place: 40 times (10 in each hundred for 100-399 + 10 in 400-449).\n     - Units place: 39 times (10 in each hundred for 100-399 + 9 in 400-488).\n     - Total: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n   - **8's:**\n     - Hundreds place: 0 times.\n     - Tens place: 39 times (10 in each hundred for 100-399 + 9 in 400-488).\n     - Units place: 39 times (10 in each hundred for 100-399 + 9 in 400-488).\n     - Total: 39 + 39 = 78.\n\n**Total counts:**\n- 4's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n- 8's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nSo, the pages go from 1 to 488. That means the first 9 pages are single-digit numbers, from 1 to 9. Then, pages 10 to 99 are two-digit numbers, and from 100 onwards up to 488, they are three-digit numbers. I guess I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each of these ranges separately and then compare them.\n\nLet me start by considering single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the only single-digit numbers that have 4 or 8 are 4 and 8 themselves. So, for single-digit pages, there's exactly one 4 and one 8. That means, so far, the count for 4's is 1 and for 8's is also 1, so they are equal here.\n\nNext, I'll move on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I think I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each place separately.\n\nStarting with the tens place: For two-digit numbers, the tens digit can range from 1 to 9. So, for the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, when the tens digit is 4, the numbers are 40 to 49, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Similarly, for 8 in the tens place, the numbers are 80 to 89, which is another 10 occurrences.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers: The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each tens digit. So, for each tens digit, the units digit will be 4 exactly once every 10 numbers. Since there are 9 tens digits (from 1 to 9), that's 9 times 1, so 9 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Similarly, for 8 in the units place, it's also 9 times 1, so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, adding up the two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19. And for 8's, it's also 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19. So, in two-digit pages, the count for 4's and 8's is equal again, both at 19.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because there are three places: hundreds, tens, and units. Let me handle each place separately.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, for the hundreds place:\n\n- When the hundreds digit is 4, the numbers range from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? Well, from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, for the digit 8 in the hundreds place, since the maximum page is 488, the hundreds digit can't be 8. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place for any three-digit page number here. So, zero occurrences for 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can range from 0 to 9 for each hundreds digit. Let's break it down by hundreds:\n\n- For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each of these will have tens digits from 0 to 9, so for each, the digit 4 and 8 can appear in the tens place.\n\nLet me calculate how many times 4 appears in the tens place:\n\n- For each hundreds digit (1, 2, 3), the tens digit 4 occurs exactly 10 times (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, 340-349). So, that's 3 hundreds * 10 = 30 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place:\n\n- For each hundreds digit (1, 2, 3), the tens digit 8 occurs exactly 10 times. So, 3 * 10 = 30 times.\n\nBut wait, when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can go up to 8 (since the last page is 488). So, for hundreds digit 4, the tens digit can be 0 to 8. Let's check how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nFor 4 in the tens place when hundreds digit is 4: The numbers would be 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 occurrences.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place when hundreds digit is 4: The numbers would be 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me correct that. The hundreds digit is 4, so the tens digit can be 0 to 8. So, for 4 in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. For 8 in the tens place, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, for the hundreds digit 4, the tens place contributes 10 for 4 and 9 for 8.\n\nWait, but earlier, I considered hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, each contributing 10 for 4 and 10 for 8 in the tens place. But when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can't go beyond 8 because the book ends at 488. So, I need to adjust that.\n\nSo, let me recast this:\n\n- Hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each contributes 10 times 4 and 10 times 8 in the tens place. So, 3 hundreds * 10 = 30 for both 4 and 8.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: Tens digit can be 0 to 8. So, for 4 in the tens place, it's 440-449: 10 numbers. For 8 in the tens place, it's 480-488: 9 numbers.\n\nTherefore, total for the tens place in three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4's: 30 (from 1,2,3) + 10 (from 4) = 40\n- 8's: 30 (from 1,2,3) + 9 (from 4) = 39\n\nWait, but that seems off because when hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit for 8 only goes up to 8, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, yes, 9.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each combination of hundreds and tens digits.\n\nLet me calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in the units place across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488.\n\nFirst, for 4 in the units place:\n\n- For each hundreds digit (1,2,3,4), and for each tens digit (0-9, except when hundreds digit is 4, tens digits go up to 8), the units digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers.\n\nBut this might be a bit complicated, so perhaps a better approach is to consider how many numbers have 4 in the units place.\n\nFrom 100 to 488, how many numbers have 4 as the units digit?\n\nWell, starting from 104, 114, 124, ..., up to 484. Similarly, for 8 in the units place: 108, 118, ..., up to 488.\n\nWait, but when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can only go up to 8, so 488 is included, but 498 would be beyond the book's pages.\n\nLet me calculate the number of times 4 appears in the units place:\n\nFor hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each has 10 possible tens digits (0-9), so for each hundreds digit, there are 10 numbers ending with 4. So, 3 hundreds * 10 = 30.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4: Tens digits go from 0 to 8, so 9 tens digits. Each of these will have a units digit of 4 once. So, 9 numbers: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in units place: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place:\n\nFor hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each has 10 tens digits, so 10 numbers ending with 8 per hundreds digit. So, 3 * 10 = 30.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4: Tens digits go from 0 to 8, so 9 tens digits. Each will have a units digit of 8 once. So, 9 numbers: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nTherefore, total 8's in units place: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but wait a second. When hundreds digit is 4, and tens digit is 8, the units digit can be 8, so 488 is included. So, that's correct, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, putting it all together for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n- Tens place: 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n- Units place: 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n\nTotal 8's in three-digit numbers: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check the tens place calculation.\n\nEarlier, I thought that for hundreds digits 1,2,3, each contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 3*10=30 each. Then, for hundreds digit 4, 4 in the tens place contributes 10 (440-449) and 8 in the tens place contributes 9 (480-488). So, 4's in tens place: 30 +10=40, and 8's in tens place: 30 +9=39.\n\nSimilarly, units place: 4's: 30 (from 1,2,3) +9 (from 4)=39, and 8's: 30 +9=39.\n\nSo, yes, that adds up. So, three-digit numbers have 168 4's and 78 8's.\n\nNow, let me sum up all the counts from single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nSingle-digit:\n- 4's:1\n- 8's:1\n\nTwo-digit:\n- 4's:19\n- 8's:19\n\nThree-digit:\n- 4's:168\n- 8's:78\n\nTotal 4's: 1 +19 +168 = 188\nTotal 8's:1 +19 +78 = 98\n\nWait, that can't be right because 188 -98=90, which seems like a big difference. Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, when I calculated three-digit numbers, I think I may have overcounted the 4's in the hundreds place. Let me re-examine that.\n\nThe hundreds digit for three-digit numbers ranges from 1 to 4. So, when hundreds digit is 4, the numbers go from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? It's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers, which is correct. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nBut wait, when I calculated the 4's in the hundreds place, I included all 89 numbers, which is correct because each of those 89 numbers has a hundreds digit of 4. So, that part is correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for hundreds digits 1,2,3, each contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 30 each. Then, for hundreds digit 4, 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488). So, 4's in tens place: 30 +10=40, 8's:30 +9=39. That seems correct.\n\nIn the units place, for hundreds digits 1,2,3, each contributes 10 4's and 10 8's, so 30 each. For hundreds digit 4, 9 4's and 9 8's, so total units place: 39 each.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (units) = 168.\n\nTotal 8's in three-digit numbers:0 (hundreds) +39 (tens) +39 (units) =78.\n\nSo, adding up all page numbers:\n\nSingle-digit: 4's=1, 8's=1\nTwo-digit:4's=19,8's=19\nThree-digit:4's=168,8's=78\n\nTotal 4's:1+19+168=188\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because the difference seems quite large. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the three-digit units place. Let me recount the units place.\n\nFor units digit 4 in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds digits 1,2,3: Each has 10 numbers ending with 4 (e.g., 104,114,...,194 for hundreds=1). So, 10 per hundreds digit, 3 hundreds digits: 3*10=30.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: Tens digits go from 0 to8, so 9 tens digits. Each will have a units digit of 4 once, so 9 numbers:404,414,...,484. So, 9.\n\nTotal units digit 4:30+9=39.\n\nSimilarly, units digit 8:\n\n- Hundreds digits 1,2,3: Each has 10 numbers ending with 8, so 3*10=30.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: Tens digits go from 0 to8, so 9 numbers:408,418,...,488. So, 9.\n\nTotal units digit 8:30+9=39.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place:\n\n- Hundreds digits 1,2,3: Each contributes 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, so 3*10=30.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: Tens digit 4 contributes 10 numbers (440-449), and tens digit 8 contributes 9 numbers (480-488).\n\nSo, 4's in tens place:30+10=40.\n\n8's in tens place:30+9=39.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's:89\n- 8's:0\n\nSo, three-digit numbers:\n\n4's:89+40+39=168\n\n8's:0+39+39=78\n\nSingle-digit:\n\n4's:1\n\n8's:1\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n4's:19\n\n8's:19\n\nTotal 4's:1+19+168=188\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"how many more 4's are printed than 8's.\" So, 90 more 4's.\n\nBut I'm a bit concerned because 90 seems like a lot. Let me check if I didn't double-count any numbers or miss a range.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the two-digit numbers. Let me recount the two-digit 4's and 8's.\n\nTwo-digit numbers:10 to 99.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\n- Tens place:40-49:10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n- Units place: For each tens digit from1 to9, units digit 4 occurs once, so 9 times.\nTotal:10+9=19.\n\nSimilarly, 8's:\n\n- Tens place:80-89:10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n- Units place: For each tens digit from1 to9, units digit 8 occurs once, so 9 times.\nTotal:10+9=19.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nSo, yes, the total counts are 188 4's and 98 8's, so 90 more 4's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the three-digit numbers. The hundreds digit 4 contributes 89 numbers, which is correct because 400 to 488 is 89 numbers.\n\nIn the tens place for hundreds digit 4, 440-449 is 10 numbers, and 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, that's correct.\n\nUnits place for hundreds digit 4: 9 numbers, as we have 404,414,...,484, which is 9 numbers because 404 is the first and 484 is the last, stepping by 10. Wait, but 484 is 484, then next would be 494, which is beyond 488, so yes, only 9 numbers.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - 4 appears once (page 4).\n   - 8 appears once (page 8).\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears 9 times (once for each ten's group), 8 appears 9 times.\n   - Total for two-digit pages: 4's = 19, 8's = 19.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears 89 times (pages 400-488).\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n   - Total for three-digit pages: 4's = 168, 8's = 78.\n\n4. **Total counts:**\n   - 4's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n   - 8's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) separately and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the digit 4. Let's consider each place value one by one.\n\n1. **Units place**: For every set of ten pages (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from page 1 to 488, how many sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, we'll take the integer part, which is 48 sets. Each set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 fours. But wait, in the last partial set (pages 481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which is another 4. So that's 48 + 1 = 49 fours in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place**: Now, for the tens place, 4 appears in a block of ten consecutive numbers. For example, 40-49 all have 4 in the tens place. Each such block contributes ten 4's. How many such blocks are there up to 488? Well, the first block is 40-49, which is one block, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks in total. Each block contributes ten 4's, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The hundreds place can only be 4 if the number is between 400 and 499. Since the book goes up to 488, we're only looking at 400-488. How many numbers are there in this range? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.\n\nNow, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me do the math: 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total.\n\nNext, I'll do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place**: Similar to the fours, in the units place, 8 appears once every ten numbers. From 1 to 488, how many sets of ten are there? As before, 48 full sets and a partial set from 481-488. Each full set contributes one 8, so 48 eights. The partial set includes 488, which is another 8, so total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place**: For the tens place, 8 appears in blocks of ten numbers where the tens digit is 8, such as 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is nine numbers (480 to 488). Each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) contributes ten 8's, so that's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 eights. The last block, 480-488, contributes nine 8's in the tens place. So total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: total fours (188) minus total eights (98) equals 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the hundreds place of 4's, I had 89 numbers from 400-488, which seems correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. For the tens place of 8's, I had 4 full blocks contributing 40 and the last partial block contributing 9, totaling 49. That seems right. Similarly, the units place for both digits had 49 each, which makes sense because the last page is 488, which ends with an 8, so that adds one more in both units and tens places.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct. The total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by understanding the different places where digits can appear. The units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers are:\n\n- 1-digit: 1 to 9\n- 2-digit: 10 to 99\n- 3-digit: 100 to 488\n\nI think I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in each place (units, tens, hundreds) and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have the total counts for both digits, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - In the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n   - The pattern is 4, 14, 24, ..., up to the largest number less than or equal to 488.\n   - To find how many such numbers there are, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full groups of 10, and then check the remainder. 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 with a remainder of 8, so the last group ends at 488.\n   - Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, let me check: from 4 to 484, that's 48 numbers, so 48 times. But does 488 have a 4 in the units place? No, it's 8. So, it's 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449, but since we go up to 488, the last group would be 440-449.\n   - Each group of 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). So, how many such blocks are there?\n   - From 1 to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488).\n   - For each hundred block except the last one (400-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, for 1-399, that's 3 blocks (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 times, so 3\u00d710=30.\n   - Now, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10.\n   - So total in the tens place: 30 + 10 = 40 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488.\n   - How many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.\n   - So, the hundreds digit is 4 exactly 89 times.\n\nAdding up all the 4's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 40\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 48 + 40 + 89 = 177.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, the digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488.\n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 with a remainder of 8, so the last number is 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that's 49 times? Wait, let me check. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10, how many numbers?\n   - The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since we only go up to 488, the last group is 480-488.\n   - Let's break it down:\n     - From 1-399: Each hundred block has a group where the tens digit is 8, contributing 10 numbers per block. There are 3 blocks (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), so 3\u00d710=30.\n     - In the 400-488 block, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 times.\n   - Total in tens place: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8 in this case. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up all the 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 39\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 39 + 0 = 88.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's:\n\n177 (number of 4's) - 88 (number of 8's) = 89.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 (since 4,14,...,484; 484 is 48\u00d710 + 4, so 48 numbers)\n- Tens: 40 (30 from 1-399, 10 from 440-449)\n- Hundreds: 89 (400-488)\nTotal 4's: 48 + 40 + 89 = 177. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49 (8,18,...,488; since 488 is included, that's 49)\n- Tens: 30 (from 1-399) + 9 (480-488) = 39\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 39 = 88. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, 177 - 88 = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8 again. From 480-488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 times the digit 8 appears in the tens place. So, 30 + 9 = 39. Correct.\n\nAnother way to check the units place for 8: The last number is 488, which ends with an 8, so that's included. So, 49 times.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. So, the difference is 89.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 177, and the number of 8's is 88. Subtracting these gives 177 - 88 = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by figuring out how many digits are there in total. The book has 488 pages, so the page numbers go from 1 to 488. Each page number is printed once, so the total number of digits isn't just 488 because each page number contributes a different number of digits. \n\nWait, no, maybe I should approach this differently. Instead of calculating the total number of digits, I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nAlright, so let's start by counting the number of 4's. I'll need to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, for the units place. The digits cycle every 10 numbers, so in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So how many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. In each block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial block from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear there. So total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nNext, the tens place. Similarly, the digit 4 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically for 10 consecutive numbers: 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 instances of the digit 4 in the tens place. \n\nHow many such blocks are there? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages. Wait, actually, the blocks where the tens digit is 4 are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. But since the book only goes up to 488, 440-449 is within the range, but 540-549 would be beyond. So how many blocks are there?\n\nFrom 40-49: 10 numbers\n140-149: another 10\n240-249: another 10\n340-349: another 10\n440-449: another 10\n\nSo that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does the last block go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 4's.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Again, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one 8 in the units place: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So how many such blocks are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks and 8 extra numbers. Each block contributes one 8, so 48. In the last partial block, 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included. So that's one more 8. So total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488). \n\nSo let's count each block:\n\n80-89: 10 numbers\n180-189: 10\n280-289: 10\n380-389: 10\n480-488: 9\n\nSo that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So total 4*10 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. The hundreds digits are 1, 2, 3, or 4. So there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So 0 8's there.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits: 48\nTens: 50\nHundreds: 89\nTotal: 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits: 49\nTens: 49\nHundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nHmm, seems correct. So there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 89 more 4's.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by understanding how many digits each page number has. Pages 1 through 9 are single-digit numbers, pages 10 through 99 are two-digit, and pages 100 through 488 are three-digit. So, I'll need to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each of these ranges separately.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers (1-9). Here, the digits are just 1, 2, 3, ..., 9. So, the digit '4' appears once, and the digit '8' also appears once. That means in single-digit pages, there's no difference between the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nNext, moving on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Each two-digit number has a tens place and a units place. I think I should calculate the number of times '4' and '8' appear in each place separately.\n\nLet's start with the tens place. For two-digit numbers, the tens digit can be from 1 to 9. So, for the tens digit being '4', the numbers would be 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so '4' appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, when the tens digit is '8', the numbers are 80 to 89, which is another 10 numbers, so '8' appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers. For each set of ten numbers (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit '4' appears once in the units place, as does the digit '8'. Since there are 9 sets of ten (10-99), each digit appears 9 times in the units place. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, from 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers, which is 9 sets of ten. So, for each digit, '4' and '8' each appear 9 times in the units place. So, for the units place, both digits appear 9 times each.\n\nAdding up the tens and units places for two-digit numbers: '4' appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times, and '8' appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times. So, in two-digit page numbers, the count of '4's and '8's is the same.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which go from 100 to 488. Each three-digit number has a hundreds place, a tens place, and a units place. I need to calculate the number of '4's and '8's in each of these places.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, when the hundreds digit is '4', the numbers range from 400 to 488. Let's see how many numbers that is. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, '4' appears 89 times. '8' doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all because the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so '8' never appears there.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0-9, and I need to count how many times '4' and '8' appear here. Let's break this down by hundreds. Each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) will have a certain number of times '4' and '8' appear in the tens place.\n\nFor hundreds 100-399:\n- Each hundred has 100 numbers, so the tens digit cycles from 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, the digit '4' appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for '8'. Since there are 3 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), that's 3 * 10 = 30 times for each digit in the tens place.\n\nFor hundreds 400-488:\n- The hundreds digit is 4, so the tens digit can go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digit ranges from 0 to 8, which is 9 possibilities. Now, how many times does '4' appear in the tens place here? Only once, because the tens digit is '4' in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, '8' appears once in the tens place in 480-489, but since our last page is 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but 488 is included, so from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers. So, '8' appears 9 times in the tens place here. \n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me check again. From 400 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, but when the tens digit is 8, the units digit can only go up to 8, so it's 9 numbers (480-488). So, in the tens place, '4' appears 10 times (440-449) and '8' appears 9 times (480-488). \n\nSo, adding up for the tens place in three-digit numbers:\n- '4's: 30 (from 100-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 40\n- '8's: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, I'll consider each hundred separately.\n\nFor hundreds 100-399:\n- Each hundred has 100 numbers, so the units digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, '4' appears 10 times in the units place, and same for '8'. With 3 hundreds, that's 3 * 10 = 30 for each digit.\n\nFor hundreds 400-488:\n- The units digit can be 0-9, but the hundreds digit is 4, and the tens digit varies. The units digit is independent, so for each tens digit, '4' and '8' each appear once in the units place. Since the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (9 possibilities), each digit '4' and '8' appears 9 times in the units place.\n\nWait, but actually, in 400-488, the units digit goes from 0-9 for each tens digit. So, for each tens digit (0-8), '4' appears once in the units place, so that's 9 times. Similarly, '8' appears once per tens digit, so also 9 times. So, in the units place for 400-488, '4' appears 9 times and '8' appears 9 times.\n\nSo, adding up for the units place in three-digit numbers:\n- '4's: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39\n- '8's: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 400-488, the units digit goes from 0-9 for each tens digit, but since 488 is the last page, when the tens digit is 8, the units digit only goes up to 8, not 9. So, for the units digit in 480-488, '8' appears once in the units place (at 488), but '4' would appear at 484, which is within 480-488. Wait, no, 484 is part of the tens digit 8, so the units digit is 4, which is allowed because 484 is less than 488. So, actually, in the units place for 400-488, '4' appears once per tens digit, and since there are 9 tens digits (0-8), that's 9 times. Similarly, '8' appears once per tens digit, but in the case of tens digit 8, the units digit only goes up to 8, so '8' appears once there as well. So, both '4' and '8' appear 9 times in the units place for 400-488.\n\nWait, but actually, when the tens digit is 8, the units digit goes from 0-8, so '8' appears only once in the units place for that tens digit. So, in total, for 400-488, '4' appears 9 times in the units place, and '8' also appears 9 times.\n\nSo, combining all that, for three-digit numbers:\n- '4's in hundreds place: 89\n- '4's in tens place: 40\n- '4's in units place: 39\nTotal '4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n\n- '8's in hundreds place: 0\n- '8's in tens place: 39\n- '8's in units place: 39\nTotal '8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nWait, let me check that again. Earlier, I thought '8's in the tens place for three-digit numbers were 39, and in the units place also 39, so total '8's would be 78. But let me make sure.\n\nWait, in the tens place for three-digit numbers, '8's were 39, and in the units place, also 39, so yes, 78 total '8's.\n\nNow, adding up all the digits across all page numbers:\n- '4's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (168) = 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n- '8's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78) = 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nSo, the number of '4's is 188, and the number of '8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big difference. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nLet me go through each part again.\n\nSingle-digit pages (1-9):\n- '4' appears once, '8' appears once.\n\nTwo-digit pages (10-99):\n- Tens place: '4' appears 10 times (40-49), '8' appears 10 times (80-89).\n- Units place: '4' appears 9 times (14,24,...,94), '8' appears 9 times (18,28,...,98).\n- Total '4's: 10 + 9 = 19\n- Total '8's: 10 + 9 = 19\n\nThree-digit pages (100-488):\n- Hundreds place:\n  - '4' appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n  - '8' doesn't appear in the hundreds place.\n- Tens place:\n  - For hundreds 100-399: each hundred has 10 '4's and 10 '8's in the tens place, so 3 * 10 = 30 each.\n  - For hundreds 400-488: tens digits go from 0-8, so '4' appears once (440-449) which is 10 numbers, so '4' appears 10 times. '8' appears once in the tens place (480-488), which is 9 numbers, so '8' appears 9 times.\n  - So, total '4's in tens place: 30 + 10 = 40\n  - Total '8's in tens place: 30 + 9 = 39\n- Units place:\n  - For hundreds 100-399: each hundred has 10 '4's and 10 '8's in the units place, so 3 * 10 = 30 each.\n  - For hundreds 400-488: units digits go from 0-9 for each tens digit, except when tens digit is 8, where units go up to 8.\n    - So, for each tens digit (0-8), '4' appears once in the units place, so 9 times.\n    - Similarly, '8' appears once in the units place for each tens digit, but when tens digit is 8, units only go up to 8, so '8' appears once there as well.\n    - So, '4's: 9 times, '8's: 9 times.\n  - So, total '4's in units place: 30 + 9 = 39\n  - Total '8's in units place: 30 + 9 = 39\n\nSo, total '4's in three-digit numbers: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\nTotal '8's in three-digit numbers: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n\nAdding all together:\n- '4's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188\n- '8's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more '4's than '8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe number of '4's printed is 188, and the number of '8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by understanding the range of page numbers. The book has pages from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers are 1-digit (1-9), 2-digit (10-99), and 3-digit (100-488). I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for the digit 8, then find the difference.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **One-digit page numbers (1-9):** Here, the only page number with a 4 is page 4. So, that's 1 occurrence.\n\n2. **Two-digit page numbers (10-99):** Now, I need to consider both the tens and units place.\n\n   - **Tens place:** Pages 40-49 have 4 in the tens place. That's 10 pages, so 10 occurrences.\n   \n   - **Units place:** For every ten pages (like 14, 24, 34, ..., 94), there's a 4 in the units place. From 10-99, how many such pages are there? Well, from 10-99, each ten has one 4 in the units place, so that's 9 times (14,24,...,94). Wait, but 44 is already counted in the tens place, but since we're looking at units, it's still just 9 occurrences because 44 is included in both. Wait, no, actually, each ten has one 4 in the units place, so from 10-99, that's 9 times (14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94). Wait, that's 9, but 44 is in both, but when counting units, it's just 9. So, 9 occurrences.\n\n   So, for two-digit numbers, total 4's are 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\n3. **Three-digit page numbers (100-488):** Now, this is a bit more complex because we have hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\n   - **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. Let's see, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 occurrences.\n\n   - **Tens place:** Now, we need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place in three-digit numbers. This can happen in two scenarios: when the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4, but wait, up to 488, so hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n     For each hundreds digit (1, 2, 3), the tens digit can be 4, and the units can be 0-9. So, for hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, each contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. That's 3 * 10 = 30.\n\n     Now, when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit is 4, but the units can go up to 8 because the book ends at 488. So, from 440 to 448, that's 9 pages (440, 441, ..., 448). So, that's 9 occurrences.\n\n     So, total 4's in the tens place: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\n   - **Units place:** Now, counting how many times 4 appears in the units place for three-digit numbers. Again, hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\n     For each hundreds digit, the units digit can be 4, and the tens digit can be 0-9. But we have to be careful when the hundreds digit is 4 because the maximum page is 488.\n\n     Let's break it down:\n\n     - Hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: For each, the units digit is 4, and tens can be 0-9, so 10 each. That's 3 * 10 = 30.\n\n     - Hundreds digit 4: Units digit is 4, but the tens digit can be 0-8 (since 488 is the max). So, from 404, 414, ..., 484. How many? From 0 to 8 in the tens place, that's 9 occurrences.\n\n     So, total 4's in the units place: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\n   So, for three-digit numbers, total 4's are 89 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 167.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n\n- One-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 167\n\nTotal 4's = 1 + 19 + 167 = 187.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **One-digit page numbers (1-9):** The only 8 is page 8, so 1 occurrence.\n\n2. **Two-digit page numbers (10-99):**\n\n   - **Tens place:** Pages 80-89 have 8 in the tens place, which is 10 pages, so 10 occurrences.\n\n   - **Units place:** For every ten pages (18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98), that's 9 occurrences (since 88 is included but we're only counting units place, so 9 times). Wait, from 10-99, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's 9 times: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. So, 9 occurrences.\n\n   So, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\n3. **Three-digit page numbers (100-488):**\n\n   - **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can't be 8 because the book only goes up to 488. So, no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\n   - **Tens place:** Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\n     For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, 4:\n\n     - Hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each can have tens digit 8, and units digits 0-9. So, 3 * 10 = 30.\n\n     - Hundreds digit 4: Tens digit 8, but units digit can only go up to 8 (since 488 is the max). So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 occurrences.\n\n     So, total 8's in the tens place: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\n   - **Units place:** Now, counting how many times 8 appears in the units place for three-digit numbers.\n\n     For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, 4:\n\n     - Hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each can have units digit 8, and tens digits 0-9, so 10 each. That's 3 * 10 = 30.\n\n     - Hundreds digit 4: Units digit 8, and tens digits can be 0-8 (since 488 is the max). So, from 408, 418, ..., 488. How many? Tens digits 0-8, so 9 occurrences.\n\n     So, total 8's in the units place: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\n   So, for three-digit numbers, total 8's are 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n\n- One-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\n\nTotal 8's = 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check the three-digit 8's. For the tens place, when hundreds digit is 4, tens digit 8, units can be 0-8, which is 9 numbers. Similarly, for units place, when hundreds digit is 4, units digit 8, tens can be 0-8, which is 9 numbers. So, that seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 187, total 8's: 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the three-digit numbers for 4's and 8's.\n\nWait, for 4's in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, correct.\n\n- Tens place: For hundreds digits 1,2,3, each contributes 10 (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), so 3*10=30. Then, when hundreds digit is 4, tens digit 4, units can be 0-8, so 9 numbers (440-448). So, 30+9=39, correct.\n\n- Units place: For hundreds digits 1,2,3, each has 10 numbers where units digit is 4 (e.g., 104,114,...,194 for hundreds=1, same for 2 and 3). So, 3*10=30. Then, when hundreds digit is 4, units digit 4, tens can be 0-8, so 9 numbers (404,414,...,484). So, 30+9=39, correct. So, 39+39+89=167, plus 19 from two-digit and 1 from one-digit, total 187, correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, correct.\n\n- Tens place: For hundreds digits 1,2,3, each contributes 10 (e.g., 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), so 3*10=30. Then, when hundreds digit is 4, tens digit 8, units 0-8, so 9 numbers (480-488). So, 30+9=39, correct.\n\n- Units place: For hundreds digits 1,2,3, each contributes 10 (e.g., 108,118,...,198 for hundreds=1, same for 2 and 3). So, 3*10=30. Then, when hundreds digit is 4, units digit 8, tens can be 0-8, so 9 numbers (408,418,...,488). So, 30+9=39, correct. So, 39+39=78, plus 19 from two-digit and 1 from one-digit, total 98, correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly for two-digit numbers. For two-digit 4's, tens place is 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's in tens place. Units place is 14,24,...,94, which is 9 numbers, so 9 4's. So, total 19, correct.\n\nSimilarly for 8's: tens place 80-89, 10 numbers, units place 18,28,...,98, which is 9 numbers, so 19 total, correct.\n\nSo, the total 4's are 187, 8's are 98, difference is 89.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by understanding how many digits each page number has. The first page is 1, which is a single-digit number, and the last page is 488, which is a three-digit number. So, I'll need to consider page numbers from 1 to 488 and count how many times the digits 4 and 8 appear in each position: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nI'll tackle each digit position separately. Starting with the units place. For every set of ten consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. For example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, 4 appears once (at 4) and 8 appears once (at 8). \n\nNow, how many such sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, I'll consider 48 full sets and then the remaining 8 pages. In each full set, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for 48 sets, that's 48 times each. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, total units place occurrences: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8. So, in the units place, both digits appear 49 times each. \n\nNext, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit changes every ten numbers. For example, from 1 to 10, the tens digit is 0 or 1 (for 10). Wait, actually, from 1 to 9, the tens digit is 0, and from 10 onwards, it starts increasing. So, for the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in a block of 100 numbers. Wait, let me think again. For example, in the range 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), ..., 9 (90-99). So, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. \n\nBut our book goes up to 488, so we have four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, no, actually, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So, let me correct that. Each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8. \n\nNow, how many full hundreds do we have? 488 is 4 full hundreds (1-400) plus 88 pages (401-488). Wait, no, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88, but actually, 400 is the end of the fourth hundred, so 401-488 is the next 88 pages. So, first, let's calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place in each full hundred. \n\nEach hundred contributes 10 occurrences for each digit in the tens place. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times for 4 and 40 times for 8 in the tens place. Now, we need to check the remaining 88 pages (401-488). Let's see, 401-488 is 88 numbers. Let's break this down into tens places. The tens digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 401-410, tens digit is 0; 411-420, tens digit is 1; 421-430, tens digit is 2; 431-440, tens digit is 3; 441-450, tens digit is 4; 451-460, tens digit is 5; 461-470, tens digit is 6; 471-480, tens digit is 7; 481-490, tens digit is 8; but since we only go up to 488, the last set is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. \n\nWait, but 401-488 is 88 numbers. Let me check: 401 is the first, so 401 is the 401st page, and 488 is the last. So, from 401 to 488, that's 88 numbers. So, how many times does the tens digit equal 4 and 8 in this range?\n\nLooking at the tens digits:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 numbers)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10 numbers)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10 numbers)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10 numbers)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 numbers)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10 numbers)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10 numbers)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10 numbers)\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 numbers)\n\nSo, in the tens place, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the digit 4 appears once in the tens place (from 441-450, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 441-450 is 10 numbers, so the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place from 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, that's 8 numbers, so 8 occurrences.\n\nWait, but in the range 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 occurs in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, in the last partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nTherefore, total tens place occurrences:\n\nFor 4: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 10 in the last partial hundred, totaling 50.\n\nFor 8: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 8 in the last partial hundred, totaling 48.\n\nWait, but wait, no, because the last partial hundred is part of the fifth hundred, right? Wait, no, 401-488 is part of the 400s, so actually, in the 400s, the hundreds digit is 4, but the tens digit can still be 0-9 as usual. So, yes, in the 400s, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (441-450), and 8 occurs 8 times (481-488). So, total for the tens place:\n\n4's: 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50.\n\n8's: 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 8 (from 401-488) = 48.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because each hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place, so for the first four hundreds (1-400), each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place, so 4 appears 10 times per hundred, so 4 hundreds give 40 times. Then, in the 401-488 range, which is 88 numbers, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, total for tens place: 4's = 40 + 10 = 50, 8's = 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nWait, but I think I need to check if 481-488 is part of the 400s. Yes, because 481 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, 1 units. So, yes, the tens digit is 8, and there are 8 numbers where the tens digit is 8.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's total 50 and 8's total 48.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, 300-399 would have hundreds digit 3, and 400-488 would have hundreds digit 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have hundreds digit 8, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 8's count in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Units place:\n  - 4's: 49\n  - 8's: 49\n\n- Tens place:\n  - 4's: 50\n  - 8's: 48\n\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 4's: 89\n  - 8's: 0\n\nNow, adding them all up:\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEach ten has one 4 in the units place. 488 divided by 10 is 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484). So, total units 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly for 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) give 4 * 10 = 40 for 4's and 40 for 8's. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450 (10 numbers), so 10 times, and 8 occurs in 481-488 (8 numbers), so 8 times. So, total tens place: 4's = 40 + 10 = 50; 8's = 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's occur from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. 8's don't occur in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so 0 times.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if I counted the hundreds place correctly. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those, so 89 times. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about how many three-digit numbers there are. From 100 to 488, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 4's in the hundreds place start at 400, which is correct.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Identify the Ranges:**\n   - Pages are numbered from 1 to 488, which includes 1-digit, 2-digit, and 3-digit numbers.\n\n2. **Count Digit Occurrences in Each Position:**\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 pages.\n     - Total units place occurrences for '4' and '8': 49 each (48 full tens + 1 in the remaining 8 pages).\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - Each digit appears 10 times in every 100 pages.\n     - For '4': 40 times in the first 400 pages + 10 times in 441-450 = 50 times.\n     - For '8': 40 times in the first 400 pages + 8 times in 481-488 = 48 times.\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - '4' appears in pages 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n     - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n\n3. **Summarize Total Occurrences:**\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n4. **Calculate the Difference:**\n   - 188 (number of '4's) - 97 (number of '8's) = 91.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe digit '4' is printed 91 times more than the digit '8'.  \n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with one-digit page numbers: these are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digits are just single numbers. So, how many 4's are there? Well, only page 4. And how about 8's? Only page 8. So, in the one-digit numbers, there's one 4 and one 8. That means the count of 4's and 8's is equal here, so no difference yet.\n\nNext, moving on to two-digit page numbers, which go from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I think I should calculate how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place, and do the same for 8.\n\nStarting with the tens place: For two-digit numbers, the tens digit can be from 1 to 9. So, for 4 in the tens place, the numbers would be 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times 4 appears in the tens place. Similarly, for 8 in the tens place, the numbers are 80-89, which is another 10 numbers, so 10 times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the units place: In the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once every 10 numbers. So, in the two-digit numbers, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, from 10 to 99, for each ten's group (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. There are 9 such groups (10-19 up to 90-99), so that's 9 times. Wait, no, actually, from 10 to 99, that's 90 numbers, which is 9 groups of 10. So, 4 appears 9 times in the units place. Similarly, 8 appears 9 times in the units place.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me check that again. From 10 to 99, each units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each ten's group. So, for each ten's group, the units digit 4 appears once. There are 9 ten's groups (10-19, 20-29,...,90-99). So, 9 times for 4 and 9 times for 8 in the units place.\n\nWait, but actually, when I think about it, from 10 to 99, that's 90 numbers, which is 9 sets of 10. So, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 9 times in the units place. So, 4 appears 9 times, and 8 appears 9 times. So, in the units place for two-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear 9 times each.\n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, 4's total is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19 times. Similarly, 8's total is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19 times. So, in two-digit numbers, 4 and 8 appear the same number of times. Hmm, so so far, in one-digit and two-digit numbers, the counts are equal.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. Wait, actually, the book has 488 pages, so the page numbers go up to 488. So, three-digit numbers start at 100 and go up to 488. I need to consider how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds, tens, and units places in this range.\n\nLet me break this down by each digit place.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. For three-digit numbers, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, let's see:\n\n- When the hundreds digit is 1: Numbers from 100 to 199. So, 100 numbers. In this range, the hundreds digit is 1, so 4 and 8 don't appear in the hundreds place here.\n\n- When the hundreds digit is 2: Numbers from 200 to 299. Similarly, the hundreds digit is 2, so no 4 or 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n- When the hundreds digit is 3: Numbers from 300 to 399. Again, hundreds digit is 3, so no 4 or 8 here.\n\n- When the hundreds digit is 4: Numbers from 400 to 488. Here, the hundreds digit is 4, so every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, for the hundreds place in three-digit numbers, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 never appears in the hundreds place in three-digit numbers because 800 is beyond 488.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place in three-digit numbers. Let's consider each possible hundreds group.\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 100-199. The tens digit can be 0-9, so for each tens digit, how many times does 4 and 8 appear?\n\nIn the tens place for 100-199, for each ten's group (like 100-109, 110-119,...,190-199), the digit in the tens place cycles from 0-9. So, in each ten's group, 4 appears once in the tens place, and 8 appears once in the tens place.\n\nSince there are 10 ten's groups (0-9), each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 100-199, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds digit 2: 200-299. The same logic applies. Each ten's group has 10 numbers, so 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place.\n\nFor hundreds digit 3: 300-399. Again, same as above. 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4: 400-488. Now, this is a bit different because the range stops at 488, not 499. So, the tens digit in this case can be 0-8, but wait, let me check. 400-488: The tens digit goes from 0 to 8, because 488 is the last page. So, the tens digit can be 0 (400-409), 1 (410-419), ..., up to 8 (480-488). Wait, but 488 is the last number, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). But the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we stop at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, the tens digit in 400-488 can be 0,1,2,...,8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here?\n\nWait, 4 in the tens place would be when the tens digit is 4, so that's 440-449. But wait, does 449 exist? The book goes up to 488, so 449 is within that range. So, from 440 to 449, that's 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nSimilarly, 8 in the tens place would be when the tens digit is 8, which is 480-488. But as I thought earlier, that's 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. For 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place here.\n\nWhen the tens digit is 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here.\n\nSo, putting it all together for the tens place in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n- Hundreds digit 2: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n- Hundreds digit 3: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n- Hundreds digit 4: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total for tens place in three-digit numbers:\n\n4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 times.\n\n8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 40 times, and 8 appears 39 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, let's consider each hundreds group.\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 100-199. For each ten's group (e.g., 100-109, 110-119, etc.), the units digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each ten's group, 4 appears once in the units place, and 8 appears once. There are 10 ten's groups, so 4 appears 10 times in the units place, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds digit 2: 200-299. Same as above. 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\nFor hundreds digit 3: 300-399. Same as above. 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4: 400-488. Now, this is a bit different because the range ends at 488. Let's see how many units digits we have.\n\nIn 400-488, the units digit can be 0-9 for each ten's group, except possibly the last one. Let me check each ten's group:\n\n- 400-409: units digits 0-9, so 4 appears once (404), 8 appears once (408).\n- 410-419: same, 414 and 418.\n- 420-429: 424 and 428.\n- 430-439: 434 and 438.\n- 440-449: 444 and 448.\n- 450-459: 454 and 458.\n- 460-469: 464 and 468.\n- 470-479: 474 and 478.\n- 480-488: units digits 0-8, since 488 is the last page. So, in this group, 484 would be present, but 488 is the last, so 484 is in this group. So, 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488). Wait, but 488 is the last page, so units digits go from 0 to 8, so 488 is included, so 484 and 488 both have 8 in the units place. Wait, no, 484 has 4 in the units place, and 488 has 8. So, in 480-488, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n\nSo, for each ten's group in 400-488, 4 appears once in the units place, except maybe the last one, but as we saw, even the last ten's group (480-488) has one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n\nWait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, from 480 to 488. So, the units digits go from 0 to 8. So, in this group, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, each ten's group in 400-488 has exactly one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n\nHow many ten's groups are there in 400-488? Let's see: 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. That's 9 ten's groups, right? Because from 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, so 9 groups.\n\nWait, no, 400-409 is the first, then 410-419, up to 480-488, which is the ninth group. So, 9 groups in total. Each group contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 4 appears 9 times, and 8 appears 9 times in the units place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in each group, 4 and 8 each appear once, so 9 groups would give 9 times each. But wait, let me check: 400-409: 404 and 408, so two numbers. Similarly, each group up to 470-479: 474 and 478. Then 480-488: 484 and 488. So, each group has two numbers where either 4 or 8 is in the units place, but each digit appears once per group. So, yes, 9 groups, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 9 times for 4 and 9 times for 8 in the units place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nWait, but wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, right? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, if we have 9 ten's groups, each with 10 numbers except the last one which has 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, 400-409 is 10 numbers, 410-419 is 10, ..., 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, actually, there are 9 ten's groups, but the last one has only 9 numbers. So, in the units place, for the last group, 480-488, the units digits go from 0 to 8, so 484 is included, but 488 is the last. So, in this group, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, each group contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place, regardless of the number of numbers in the group. So, 9 groups, so 9 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nSo, putting it all together for the units place in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n- Hundreds digit 2: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n- Hundreds digit 3: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n- Hundreds digit 4: 4 appears 9 times, 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because for hundreds digits 1,2,3, each contributes 10 times for both 4 and 8 in the units place, and for hundreds digit 4, it's 9 times each. So, total units place counts:\n\n4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\n8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, in the units place, 4 and 8 each appear 39 times in the three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in the tens place, 4 appears 40 times and 8 appears 39 times. Let me confirm that again.\n\nIn the tens place:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 10 times each.\n- Hundreds digit 2: 10 times each.\n- Hundreds digit 3: 10 times each.\n- Hundreds digit 4: 10 times for 4, 9 times for 8.\n\nSo, total for tens place: 4's = 10+10+10+10 = 40, 8's = 10+10+10+9 = 39.\n\nIn the units place:\n\n- Hundreds digits 1,2,3: each 10 times.\n- Hundreds digit 4: 9 times.\n\nSo, 4's: 10+10+10+9=39, 8's: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n- Tens place: 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n- Units place: 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\nSo, total for three-digit numbers:\n\n4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168 times.\n\n8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78 times.\n\nWait, let me add that up again:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n- Tens place: 40 for 4, 39 for 8.\n- Units place: 39 for 4, 39 for 8.\n\nSo, total 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nTotal 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, in three-digit numbers, 4 appears 168 times, and 8 appears 78 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the digits from one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nFirst, one-digit numbers:\n\n4's: 1 (page 4)\n8's: 1 (page 8)\n\nTwo-digit numbers:\n\n4's: 19 (as calculated earlier)\n8's: 19\n\nThree-digit numbers:\n\n4's: 168\n8's: 78\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with one-digit:\n\n- 4:1, 8:1. Correct.\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- Tens place: 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n- Units place: 4 appears 9 times (14,24,...,94), same for 8.\n- So, 10+9=19 each. Correct.\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8:0. Correct.\n- Tens place:\n\n  - Hundreds digits 1,2,3: each contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 for 8.\n  - Hundreds digit 4: 10 for 4, 9 for 8.\n  \n  So, 4's: 10+10+10+10=40; 8's: 10+10+10+9=39. Correct.\n\n- Units place:\n\n  - Hundreds digits 1,2,3: each contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 for 8.\n  - Hundreds digit 4: 9 times for 4 and 9 for 8.\n  \n  So, 4's: 10+10+10+9=39; 8's: same. Correct.\n\nSo, three-digit:\n\n4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\n8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nTotal:\n\n4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\n8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I feel like this might not be correct because when I think about three-digit numbers, 488 is the last page, so maybe I'm overcounting somewhere.\n\nLet me check the units place in three-digit numbers again. For hundreds digit 4, units place:\n\n- From 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEach ten's group contributes one 4 in the units place, except perhaps the last group.\n\nWait, 400-409: 404\n410-419: 414\n420-429: 424\n430-439: 434\n440-449: 444\n450-459: 454\n460-469: 464\n470-479: 474\n480-488: 484\n\nThat's 9 times, so 9 times for 4 in the units place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the units place:\n\n400-409: 408\n410-419: 418\n420-429: 428\n430-439: 438\n440-449: 448\n450-459: 458\n460-469: 468\n470-479: 478\n480-488: 488\n\nThat's 9 times for 8 in the units place.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place for hundreds digit 4, 480-488 has 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in the tens place for hundreds digit 4, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). That seems correct.\n\nSo, perhaps the counts are accurate.\n\nSo, the difference is 90. So, 4's are printed 90 times more than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again: 188 total 4's and 98 total 8's, so 188 - 98 = 90. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me check another way. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately and see if the difference is 90.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate how many 4's and 8's are in each digit place across all page numbers.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's consider each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately and count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nIn each block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, there are 48 blocks of 10, so 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which is another 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 480, 48 blocks of 10, so 48 times. From 481 to 488, 488 is included, which is another 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier count where units place 4's were 39 and 8's were 39. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I'm confusing something. Let me clarify:\n\nWhen considering all page numbers from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in each set of 10 numbers, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 numbers?\n\n488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 times each. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier count where I had 39 for 4's and 39 for 8's in the units place for three-digit numbers. Hmm, so perhaps my earlier approach was wrong.\n\nWait, I think I see the problem. Earlier, when I considered three-digit numbers separately, I might have miscounted. Let me try this alternative approach.\n\nLet me calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each digit place across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nAs above, 488 numbers. 488 / 10 = 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 and one 8. So, 48 times each. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49, and same for 8's.\n\nTens place:\n\nSimilarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, in 488 numbers, how many hundreds do we have?\n\nWe have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more numbers (401-488).\n\nIn each full hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place, so for 4 full hundreds, each digit appears 4*10=40 times in the tens place. So, 4's and 8's each appear 40 times in the tens place from 1-400.\n\nNow, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-488). So, let's see:\n\n- Tens digit 0: 401-410. That's 10 numbers, but 401-410 is 10 numbers, so 401-410 has tens digit 0. So, 4 doesn't appear here in the tens place, and 8 doesn't either.\n\n- Tens digit 1: 411-420. 10 numbers, so 4 doesn't appear in the tens place here.\n\n- Similarly, up to tens digit 8: 481-488. That's 8 numbers, so tens digit 8 appears 8 times.\n\nWait, but wait, in the tens place, from 401-488, how many times does 4 and 8 appear?\n\nWait, 401-488 is 88 numbers. Let's break it down by tens:\n\n- 400-409: tens digit 0 (but 400 is included in the 400-488 range)\n- 410-419: tens digit 1\n- ...\n- 480-488: tens digit 8.\n\nSo, from 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit, how many numbers:\n\n- Tens digit 0: 400-409: 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 1: 410-419: 10\n- ...\n- Tens digit 8: 480-488: 9 numbers\n\nSo, for tens digit 4: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place here.\n\nFor tens digit 8: 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, from 400-488, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place counts:\n\nFrom 1-400: 40 times each for 4 and 8.\n\nFrom 401-488: 10 for 4, 9 for 8.\n\nSo, total tens place:\n\n4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I considered the units place, I had 49 for both. Hmm, perhaps this approach is more accurate.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-99: no hundreds digit, so 0 times.\n\nFrom 100-488: hundreds digits are 1,2,3,4.\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 100-199: 100 numbers. So, 100 times 1 appears in hundreds place. But we're counting 4's and 8's, so 0 times.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2: 200-299: same, 0 times for 4 and 8.\n\n- Hundreds digit 3: 300-399: same, 0 times.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and 8 never appears here.\n\nSo, total hundreds place:\n\n4's: 89.\n\n8's: 0.\n\nNow, summing up all digit places:\n\nUnits place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49.\n\nTens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 49.\n\nHundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, so this confirms the earlier result. So, the difference is 90.\n\nBut wait, in the units place, I initially thought that in three-digit numbers, units place 4's were 39, but with this alternative approach, it's 49. So, perhaps my earlier method was wrong, and this approach is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier method by not considering that in the units place, the count is actually higher because it's not just three-digit numbers, but all numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nSo, in the first approach, I considered one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit separately, but in the alternative approach, I considered all numbers together, which might have been more accurate.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me think again. In the units place, from 1 to 488, 4 appears 49 times, and 8 appears 49 times. So, no difference there.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times. So, 1 more for 4.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times. So, 89 more for 4.\n\nSo, total difference: (50 + 89) - (49 + 0) = 139 - 49 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times, so no difference. In the tens place, 4 appears once more than 8. In the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times more than 8. So, total difference is 89 +1 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Analyze Each Digit Place Separately:**\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - From 1 to 488, each digit (0-9) appears equally in the units place every 10 numbers.\n     - There are 48 full sets of 10 in 480, contributing 48 '4's and 48 '8's.\n     - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include one '4' (484) and one '8' (488).\n     - **Total Units Place:** 49 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - Each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for every 100 numbers.\n     - From 1 to 400, each digit appears 40 times in the tens place.\n     - From 401 to 488, '4' appears 10 times (440-449), and '8' appears 9 times (480-488).\n     - **Total Tens Place:** 50 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by understanding the range of page numbers. The book starts at page 1 and goes up to page 488. So, the page numbers are from 1 to 488. Now, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to consider each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For each set of ten consecutive numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. \n\nNow, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 complete sets of ten. Each of these sets contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, that's 48 times 1 for 4's, which is 48, and the same for 8's, 48.\n\nBut wait, after 480, the remaining pages are 481 to 488. So, that's 8 more pages. In these, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place for these remaining pages, does a 4 appear? Yes, at 484. And an 8 appears at 488. So, that's one more 4 and one more 8. \n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 48 (from the complete sets) + 1 (from the remaining pages) = 49. Similarly, 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nNext, let's move to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in a set of 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in 80-89, which is also 10 times.\n\nNow, how many complete sets of 100 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these sets contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, that's 4 times 10 = 40 for both 4's and 8's.\n\nNow, the remaining pages after 400 are 401 to 488. Let's look at the tens place here. The tens digits go from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 481-488). \n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place from 401-488? Well, 401-410: tens digit is 0. 411-420: tens digit is 1. Wait, no, actually, 401-410 is the first set, then 411-420, etc. But the tens digit is 0 in 401-410, 1 in 411-420, 2 in 421-430, 3 in 431-440, 4 in 441-450, 5 in 451-460, 6 in 461-470, 7 in 471-480, and 8 in 481-488.\n\nSo, the digit 4 appears in the tens place from 441-450, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place from 481-488, which is 8 numbers (since 488 is the last page). \n\nWait, but 441-450 is 10 numbers, so that's 10 4's in the tens place. For 8's, from 481-488, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers. So, that's 8 numbers, so 8 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, in the tens place, total 4's: 40 (from the first four sets) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50. And 8's: 40 (from the first four sets) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 48 times. The difference here is 50 - 48 = 2.\n\nNow, let's look at the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is the third digit from the right. In a 488-page book, the page numbers go up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 0 (for pages 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488).\n\nSo, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, that's 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. \n\nWhat about 8's in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8's in the hundreds place appear 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89. 8's in hundreds place: 0. The difference here is 89 - 0 = 89.\n\nNow, let's sum up the differences from each digit place.\n\nFrom the units place: difference is 0.\nFrom the tens place: difference is +2.\nFrom the hundreds place: difference is +89.\n\nSo, total difference is 0 + 2 + 89 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8. Then, 481-488 adds one more 4 and one more 8. So, 48 + 1 = 49 for both. So, units place difference is 0.\n\nTens place: 4 complete sets of 100, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's. Then, in 401-488, 4's appear in the tens place from 441-450 (10 times), and 8's appear from 481-488 (8 times). So, 4's: 4*10 + 10 = 50. 8's: 4*10 + 8 = 48. So, difference is +2.\n\nHundreds place: 4's appear from 400-488, which is 89 times. 8's don't appear in hundreds place at all. So, difference is +89.\n\nAdding them up: 0 + 2 + 89 = 91.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me check again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 4's. That seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: 400 is the first page with a hundreds digit of 4, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up the differences: units place 0, tens place +2, hundreds place +89. Total difference is 91.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount in the tens place. From 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0 to 8. So, for 4's in the tens place, it's when the tens digit is 4, which is 441-450. That's 10 numbers, so 10 4's. For 8's in the tens place, it's when the tens digit is 8, which is 481-488. That's 8 numbers, so 8 8's. So, 10 vs 8, so 2 more 4's than 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, yes, the total difference is 91. So, there are 91 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n\nWait, but let me check if I considered all the digits correctly. Each page number is a three-digit number, but for pages 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0. So, when I counted the hundreds place, I only considered pages 400-488, which is correct because that's where the hundreds digit is 4. Pages 1-399 have hundreds digits of 0,1,2,3, which don't contribute to 4's or 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAlso, in the tens place, I considered both the complete hundreds and the remaining part after 400. So, that seems correct.\n\nSo, I think my final answer is that there are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 91.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Range of Page Numbers:**\n   - Pages are numbered from 1 to 488.\n\n2. **Count Digits in Each Position (Units, Tens, Hundreds):**\n\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 numbers.\n     - Complete sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 sets.\n     - 48 occurrences of 4 and 8 in units place.\n     - Remaining pages (481-488): one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n     - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n     - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n     - Difference: 0.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - Each digit (0-9) appears 10 times in every 100 numbers.\n     - Complete sets of 100 in 488 pages: 4 sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400).\n     - 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40 occurrences of 4 and 8 in tens place.\n     - Remaining pages (401-488):\n       - 4's in tens place: 441-450 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n       - 8's in tens place: 481-488 \u2192 8 occurrences.\n     - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n     - Total 8's: 40 + 8 = 48.\n     - Difference: 50 - 48 = +2.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (no 4's or 8's).\n     - Pages 100-399: hundreds digits 1, 2, 3 (no 4's or 8's).\n     - Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4.\n       - Number of pages: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n       - 89 occurrences of 4.\n     - 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n     - Difference: 89 - 0 = +89.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Difference:**\n   - Units: 0\n   - Tens: +2\n   - Hundreds: +89\n   - Total difference: 0 + 2 + 89 = 91.\n\n**Answer:**\nThere are \\boxed{91} more 4's printed than 8's."

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let's start by understanding the ranges. Pages 1 to 9 are single-digit, pages 10 to 99 are two-digit, and pages 100 to 488 are three-digit numbers. I guess I can handle each of these ranges separately to count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers, from 1 to 9. The numbers here are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So, I can see that the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 also appears once. So, in single-digit pages, the count for 4 is 1 and for 8 is 1. That means they are equal here, so no difference.\n\nNext, moving on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Each two-digit number has a tens place and a units place. I think I should count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place, and do the same for 8.\n\nLet's start with the digit 4 in two-digit numbers. In the tens place, the numbers would be 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. In the units place, 4 can appear in numbers like 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 times because 44 has already been counted in the tens place, but wait, no, actually, each occurrence is separate. Wait, no, in the units place, it's every 10 numbers, so from 10 to 99, that's 9 times (since 40-49 are already counted in the tens place, but no, actually, the units digit can be 4 in each set of ten, so from 10 to 99, there are 9 sets of ten (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), each having one 4 in the units place. Wait, that would be 9 times, right? Because 14, 24, ..., 94, which is 9 numbers. So total 4's in two-digit numbers are 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nNow for the digit 8 in two-digit numbers. In the tens place, it's 80 to 89, which is 10 numbers, so 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. In the units place, 8 can be in 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's 9 times again. So total 8's in two-digit numbers are 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nSo, in two-digit pages, 4's and 8's both appear 19 times each. So, no difference there either.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, from 100 to 488. These are a bit more complex because they have hundreds, tens, and units places. I think I'll need to consider each digit place separately for both 4 and 8.\n\nLet me first figure out the number of three-digit page numbers. Since the book has 488 pages, the three-digit numbers go from 100 to 488. That's 488 - 100 + 1 = 389 numbers. But I don't think I need the total count; instead, I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each digit place.\n\nLet's start with the hundreds place. In three-digit numbers, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, numbers from 100-199 have 1 in the hundreds place, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4.\n\nFor the digit 4 in the hundreds place: It's from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nFor the digit 8 in the hundreds place: Well, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no three-digit page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be from 0 to 9, and for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9. So, for each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. But since our book ends at 488, the last hundred (400-488) might be a bit different.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\nFirst, for hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each of these will have 100 numbers, from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399. In each of these, the tens digit cycles from 0-9, so for each hundred, each digit (including 4 and 8) appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for each of these hundreds, 10 times each digit in the tens place. Since there are three such hundreds (1, 2, 3), that's 3 * 10 = 30 times for each digit in the tens place for 4 and 8.\n\nNow, for the hundreds digit 4 (400-488), the tens digit can go from 0 to 8 because 488 is the last page. So, the tens digits are 0-8, meaning 0-8, which is 9 possible digits. But wait, no, actually, in 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digits here are 0-8, which is 9 possibilities. So, for each tens digit, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see: In 400-409, the tens digit is 0, so 4 doesn't appear in the tens place here. Then in 410-419, tens digit is 1; 420-429, tens digit 2; 430-439, tens digit 3; 440-449, tens digit 4; 450-459, tens digit 5; 460-469, tens digit 6; 470-479, tens digit 7; 480-488, tens digit 8.\n\nSo, for the tens digit being 4, it's in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Similarly, for the tens digit being 8, it's in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, in the tens place for 400-488, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total for the tens place in three-digit numbers:\n\nFor 4: 3 hundreds (1,2,3) each contribute 10 times, so 3*10=30, plus in 400-488, 10 times, so total 30+10=40 times.\n\nFor 8: 3 hundreds (1,2,3) each contribute 10 times, so 3*10=30, plus in 400-488, 9 times, so total 30+9=39 times.\n\nWait, but hold on, in the hundreds digit 4, the tens digit for 8 is only up to 488, which is 9 numbers, right? Because 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10, since 488 is the last page. So, yes, 9 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. For each hundred, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the units place. So, for hundreds 1, 2, 3, each contributes 10 times for each digit in the units place.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4 (400-488), the units digit can go from 0-9, but since the last number is 488, in the range 480-488, the units digit goes from 0-8, which is 9 numbers. So, for the units digit in 400-488, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times except for the last hundred, where digits beyond 8 might be missing.\n\nWait, no, actually, for each hundred, the units digit cycles through 0-9 for each ten. So, for 400-409, units digits 0-9; 410-419, same, and so on up to 480-488. So, in 480-488, the units digits go from 0-8, which is 9 numbers, so for units digit 8 in 480-488, it's present once (488). So, how does that affect the count?\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate for each hundred separately.\n\nFor hundreds 1, 2, 3: Each has 100 numbers, so in the units place, each digit 0-9 appears exactly 10 times. So, for each of these hundreds, 4 appears 10 times in the units place, and 8 appears 10 times as well.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4 (400-488): There are 89 numbers here (from 400 to 488 inclusive). Let's see how many times each digit appears in the units place.\n\nEach ten's group (e.g., 400-409, 410-419, etc.) has 10 numbers, except the last one, which is 480-488, which has 9 numbers. So, in each of the first 8 tens groups (400-409 up to 470-479), each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. So, for each of these 8 groups, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, that's 8 times each. Then, in the last group, 480-488, the units digits go from 0-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, in total, for the units place in 400-488, 4 appears 8+1=9 times, and 8 appears 8+1=9 times.\n\nWait, but wait, that doesn't seem right because in each ten's group, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so in 400-409, units digits 0-9, so 4 and 8 each appear once. Similarly, 410-419, same, so 8 times for the first 8 groups, which is 8*1=8 times each. Then in 480-488, units digits 0-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once. So, total for 400-488: 8+1=9 times for 4, and 8+1=9 times for 8.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit off because 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is 8 full tens (400-409 to 470-479) and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in each of the 8 full tens, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place, so 8 times each. Then in 480-488, units digits go up to 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total for units place in 400-488: 8+1=9 for 4, and 8+1=9 for 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nFor units place in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds 1,2,3: Each contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8. So, 3*10=30 for 4, and 3*10=30 for 8.\n\n- Hundreds 4: 9 times for 4 and 9 times for 8.\n\nSo, total units place counts:\n\n4: 30 + 9 = 39\n\n8: 30 + 9 = 39\n\nWait, that seems interesting. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 39 times each in three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the counts for 4 and 8 across all digit places.\n\nFirst, for 4:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n\n- Two-digit: 19\n\n- Three-digit: hundreds place: 89, tens place: 40, units place: 39\n\nSo total 4's: 1 + 19 + 89 + 40 + 39. Wait, no, wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, in three-digit numbers, I considered hundreds, tens, and units separately. So, for 4:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89\n\n- Tens place: 40\n\n- Units place: 39\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nSimilarly, for 8:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0\n\n- Tens place: 39\n\n- Units place: 39\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check that again. Because earlier, for the tens place in three-digit numbers, I had 40 for 4 and 39 for 8. And units place was 39 each.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\nFor 4:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n\n- Two-digit: 19\n\n- Three-digit: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nFor 8:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n\n- Two-digit: 19\n\n- Three-digit: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nStarting with single-digit:\n\n4:1, 8:1.\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n4:19, 8:19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\n4's:\n\n- Hundreds: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 times in hundreds place.\n\n- Tens: In 100-399, each hundred has 10 times in tens place, so 3*10=30. In 400-488, tens place 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, 30 +10=40 for 4's tens place.\n\n- Units: In 100-399, each hundred has 10 times in units place, so 3*10=30. In 400-488, units place 4 appears 9 times (as calculated earlier). So, 30 +9=39.\n\nSo, 4's total: 89 +40 +39= 168.\n\n8's:\n\n- Hundreds: 0.\n\n- Tens: In 100-399, 3*10=30. In 400-488, 9 times (480-488). So, 30 +9=39.\n\n- Units: In 100-399, 3*10=30. In 400-488, 9 times. So, 30 +9=39.\n\nSo, 8's total: 0 +39 +39=78.\n\nAdding single and two-digit:\n\n4's:1+19=20; 20+168=188.\n\n8's:1+19=20; 20+78=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me recount the three-digit units place for 8. In 400-488, units digit 8 appears in 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 times, right? So, in 400-488, units digit 8 appears 9 times. So, in three-digit numbers, units digit 8:3*10=30 (from 100-399) plus 9=39. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place in 400-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, tens place for 4:3*10=30 +10=40; for 8:3*10=30 +9=39.\n\nUnits place for 4:3*10=30 +9=39.\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n- 4 appears once.\n- 8 appears once.\n\n**Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n- 4 appears 19 times (10 in tens place, 9 in units).\n- 8 appears 19 times (10 in tens place, 9 in units).\n\n**Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n- **Hundreds place:**\n  - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n  - 8 appears 0 times.\n- **Tens place:**\n  - 4 appears 40 times (30 from 100-399, 10 from 440-449).\n  - 8 appears 39 times (30 from 100-399, 9 from 480-488).\n- **Units place:**\n  - 4 appears 39 times (30 from 100-399, 9 from 400-488).\n  - 8 appears 39 times (30 from 100-399, 9 from 400-488).\n\n**Total counts:**\n- 4's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n- 8's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, starting with one-digit page numbers. Those would be from 1 to 9. In this range, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 also appears once. So, for one-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear the same number of times. That means the difference here is zero. \n\nNext, moving on to two-digit page numbers, which go from 10 to 99. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens and units places separately. \n\nFor the tens place in two-digit numbers, 4 appears in the tens place for numbers 40 to 49. That's 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place for numbers 80 to 89, which is also 10 times. \n\nNow, looking at the units place for two-digit numbers. The digit 4 will appear once every ten numbers, like 14, 24, 34, etc., up to 94. That's 9 times because we're starting from 10, so from 10 to 99, it's 9 sets of ten. Similarly, 8 will appear once every ten numbers, from 18, 28, ..., up to 98, which is also 9 times. \n\nSo, adding up the tens and units places for two-digit numbers: 4 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times, and 8 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times. Again, both digits appear the same number of times in two-digit numbers, so the difference remains zero. \n\nNow, onto three-digit page numbers, which go from 100 to 488. This is where things might get a bit trickier because the book ends at 488, so not all three-digit numbers up to 999 are included. I need to be careful with the hundreds, tens, and units places here. \n\nLet's start with the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. \n\n- For hundreds digit 1 (100-199): The digit 4 doesn't appear in the hundreds place, but 8 also doesn't. So, no contribution from the hundreds place here. \n- For hundreds digit 2 (200-299): Same as above, neither 4 nor 8 appears in the hundreds place. \n- For hundreds digit 3 (300-399): Again, neither digit appears in the hundreds place. \n- For hundreds digit 4 (400-488): Here, the hundreds digit is 4, so every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place here because we're only going up to 488. \n\nNow, moving to the tens place in three-digit numbers. \n\n- For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, and 4, we need to consider the tens place. \n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1 (100-199): The tens digit can be 0-9. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 140-149, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place for 180-189, which is also 10 times. \n- Hundreds digit 2 (200-299): Similarly, 4 appears in the tens place for 240-249 (10 times), and 8 appears in the tens place for 280-289 (10 times). \n- Hundreds digit 3 (300-399): 4 appears in the tens place for 340-349 (10 times), and 8 appears in the tens place for 380-389 (10 times). \n- Hundreds digit 4 (400-488): Here, the tens digit can be 0-8 because 488 is the last page. So, for 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8. \n\nWait, let me clarify. For hundreds digit 4, the tens digit can be 0-8 because 488 is the maximum. So, for the tens place, 4 appears in the tens place for 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place for 480-488. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here. \n\nWait, no, let me check that again. From 400 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, for the tens place:\n\n- When the hundreds digit is 4 and the tens digit is 4, the numbers are 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 times for 4.\n- When the hundreds digit is 4 and the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 480-488. Since 488 is the last page, that's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, 9 times for 8.\n\nSo, in the tens place for hundreds digit 4, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the contributions from the tens place across all hundreds digits:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 10 (4) + 10 (8)\n- Hundreds digit 2: 10 (4) + 10 (8)\n- Hundreds digit 3: 10 (4) + 10 (8)\n- Hundreds digit 4: 10 (4) + 9 (8)\n\nSo, total for tens place:\n- 4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40\n- 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier I thought each hundreds digit 1,2,3 would have 10 each, but let me check again. Actually, for hundreds digit 1, 2, 3, each has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 3 hundreds digits \u00d7 10 = 30 for 4's, and similarly 30 for 8's. Then, for hundreds digit 4, 10 for 4's and 9 for 8's. So total:\n\n- 4's in tens place: 30 + 10 = 40\n- 8's in tens place: 30 + 9 = 39\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 40 times for 4's and 39 times for 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. \n\nFor each hundreds digit (1,2,3,4), we need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the units place across all tens digits.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1 (100-199): For each tens digit (0-9), the units digit cycles from 0-9. So, for each tens group, 4 appears once in the units place, and 8 appears once. There are 10 tens groups (0-9), so 10 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place.\n- Similarly, hundreds digit 2 (200-299): Same as above, 10 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place.\n- Hundreds digit 3 (300-399): Same, 10 times each.\n- Hundreds digit 4 (400-488): Now, here's where it's a bit different because the book ends at 488. So, the tens digit goes up to 8, and for each tens digit, the units digit cycles from 0-9, but for the last tens digit (8), the units digit only goes up to 8.\n\nWait, let me clarify. For hundreds digit 4, the tens digits are 0-8. For each tens digit from 0 to 7, the units digit goes from 0-9, so 4 and 8 each appear once per tens group. For the tens digit 8, the units digits go from 0-8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, for hundreds digit 4:\n\n- Tens digits 0-7: 8 tens groups, each contributing 1 to 4's and 1 to 8's in units place. So, 8 \u00d7 1 = 8 for both 4 and 8.\n- Tens digit 8: Units digits 0-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, 1 each.\n\nTherefore, for hundreds digit 4, units place:\n\n- 4's: 8 + 1 = 9\n- 8's: 8 + 1 = 9\n\nWait, but let me check that again. For each tens digit from 0 to 7, the units digits go from 0-9, so in each of those 8 tens groups, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, 8 \u00d7 1 = 8 for each. Then, for tens digit 8, units digits go from 0-8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, total for hundreds digit 4 in units place:\n\n- 4's: 8 (from tens 0-7) + 1 (from tens 8) = 9\n- 8's: 8 (from tens 0-7) + 1 (from tens 8) = 9\n\nWait, but that seems incorrect because when the tens digit is 8, the units digits only go up to 8, so 484 and 488 are the only ones where 4 and 8 appear in the units place. So, yes, 1 each.\n\nNow, adding up all the units place contributions:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 10 (4) + 10 (8)\n- Hundreds digit 2: 10 (4) + 10 (8)\n- Hundreds digit 3: 10 (4) + 10 (8)\n- Hundreds digit 4: 9 (4) + 9 (8)\n\nSo, total for units place:\n\n- 4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n- 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n\nWait, that can't be right because I thought earlier that hundreds digit 4 would have 9 each, but adding up, it's 39 for both. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me recast this. For hundreds digits 1,2,3, each contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the units place. So, 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 for both. Then, hundreds digit 4 contributes 9 4's and 9 8's. So, total:\n\n- 4's in units place: 30 + 9 = 39\n- 8's in units place: 30 + 9 = 39\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, both 4's and 8's appear 39 times in the units place across all three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences of 4 and 8 in three-digit numbers.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 times (from 400-488)\n- Tens place: 40 times\n- Units place: 39 times\nTotal for 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n\nNow for 8's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0 times (since the hundreds digit only goes up to 4)\n- Tens place: 39 times\n- Units place: 39 times\nTotal for 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that again because earlier I had for tens place in three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4's: 40\n- 8's: 39\n\nAnd for units place:\n\n- 4's: 39\n- 8's: 39\n\nSo, adding up:\n\nFor 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\n\nFor 8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, in three-digit numbers, 4's appear 168 times, and 8's appear 78 times.\n\nNow, let's not forget that we also have one-digit and two-digit numbers. Earlier, we determined that in one-digit and two-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear 19 times each (10 in two-digit numbers, 9 in units place, etc.). Wait, no, earlier I thought that in one-digit numbers, both appear once each, and in two-digit numbers, both appear 19 times each. Wait, let me confirm.\n\nWait, no, in the two-digit numbers, I think I had:\n\n- Tens place: 10 for 4, 10 for 8\n- Units place: 9 for 4, 9 for 8\nTotal: 19 for 4, 19 for 8\n\nAnd in one-digit numbers, both appear once each.\n\nSo, total for one-digit and two-digit numbers:\n\n- 4's: 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) = 20\n- 8's: 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) = 20\n\nSo, in one and two-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear 20 times each.\n\nNow, adding the three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4's: 168\n- 8's: 78\n\nSo, total across all page numbers:\n\n- 4's: 20 + 168 = 188\n- 8's: 20 + 78 = 98\n\nWait, that can't be right because 20 + 168 is 188, and 20 + 78 is 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But that seems high. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait, let me go back and check my calculations.\n\nStarting with three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n- Tens place: For hundreds digits 1,2,3, each contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 each. For hundreds digit 4, 4's in tens place: 10 (440-449), and 8's: 9 (480-488). So, total for tens place: 30 + 10 = 40 for 4's, and 30 + 9 = 39 for 8's. Correct.\n- Units place: For hundreds digits 1,2,3, each contributes 10 4's and 10 8's, so 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 each. For hundreds digit 4, 4's: 9, 8's:9. So, total for units place: 30 + 9 = 39 each. Correct.\n\nSo, 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n8's in three-digit numbers: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nAdding one and two-digit numbers:\n\n- 4's: 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) = 20\n- 8's: 1 + 19 = 20\n\nTotal:\n\n- 4's: 20 + 168 = 188\n- 8's: 20 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the two-digit numbers. Let me check that again.\n\nIn two-digit numbers, from 10 to 99:\n\n- Tens place: 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89)\n- Units place: For each tens group, 4 appears once, so 9 groups (10-99, excluding 40-49 and 80-89?), no, wait, no. For units place in two-digit numbers, 4 appears once in each tens group, so from 10-99, there are 9 tens groups (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99). In each, 4 appears once in the units place, so 9 times. Similarly, 8 appears once in each tens group, so 9 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's in units place for two-digit numbers is 9, and 8's is 9, plus 10 each in the tens place, making 19 each. So that seems correct.\n\nSo, 4's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n8's: 10 + 9 = 19\n\nPlus one-digit numbers:\n\n- 4's: 1\n- 8's: 1\n\nSo, total for one and two-digit numbers: 20 each.\n\nTherefore, the total counts seem correct.\n\nBut wait, the problem is with the three-digit numbers. Let me check the units place again for hundreds digit 4.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4, tens digits go from 0 to 8.\n\n- For each tens digit from 0 to 7, the units digit cycles 0-9, so 4 appears once per tens group, and 8 appears once per tens group.\n- For tens digit 8, units digits go from 0-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n\nSo, for hundreds digit 4:\n\n- Tens digits 0-7: 8 tens groups, each contributing 1 to 4's and 1 to 8's in units place. So, 8 each.\n- Tens digit 8: 1 each.\n\nTotal for units place in hundreds digit 4:\n\n- 4's: 8 + 1 = 9\n- 8's: 8 + 1 = 9\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the total counts seem accurate, leading to 188 4's and 98 8's, a difference of 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems a large difference. Let me try another approach to verify.\n\nAlternative approach: Count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately across all page numbers.\n\nPage numbers range from 1 to 488.\n\nLet's consider units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- For each page number, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers.\n- From 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 complete groups, with 8 remaining numbers (481-488).\n\nIn each complete group of 10, 4 appears once in the units place, and 8 appears once.\n\nSo, 48 complete groups \u00d7 1 = 48 each.\n\nNow, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488).\n\nSo, total units place:\n\n- 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n- 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier count. Earlier, I had 39 for 4's and 39 for 8's in units place across three-digit numbers, but this approach seems more accurate.\n\nWait, but this approach includes all page numbers, not just three-digit. Let me reconcile this.\n\nWait, in the units place across all page numbers (1-488), 4's appear 49 times, and 8's appear 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place:\n\n- The tens digit cycles 0-9 every 100 numbers.\n- From 1 to 488, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, ..., 401-500, but we only go up to 488).\n\nWait, no, actually, from 1-99: two-digit numbers, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488.\n\nSo, for tens place:\n\n- From 1-99: each tens group (10-19, ..., 90-99) has 10 numbers, so 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (40-49) and 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n- From 100-199: same as above, 4 appears 10 times in tens place, 8 appears 10 times.\n- Similarly, 200-299: 10 each.\n- 300-399: 10 each.\n- 400-488: tens digits go from 0-8. So, for 4's in tens place: 440-449, which is 10 times. For 8's: 480-488, which is 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place:\n\n- 4's: 10 (1-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 50\n- 8's: 10 (1-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 49\n\nWait, that's 50 for 4's and 49 for 8's in tens place.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\n- From 1-99: no hundreds digit, so 0.\n- 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so 0 for both 4 and 8.\n- 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, so 0.\n- 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, so 0.\n- 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so 89 times for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nSo, total hundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nNow, adding up all places:\n\nUnits place:\n- 4's: 49\n- 8's: 49\n\nTens place:\n- 4's: 50\n- 8's: 49\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nTotal for 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal for 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, so this alternative approach also leads to the same result: 90 more 4's than 8's. So, I think my initial calculation was correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **One-Digit Page Numbers (1-9):**\n   - 4 appears once.\n   - 8 appears once.\n   - Difference: 0.\n\n2. **Two-Digit Page Numbers (10-99):**\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - 4 appears 10 times (40-49).\n     - 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - 4 appears 9 times (14, 24, ..., 94).\n     - 8 appears 9 times (18, 28, ..., 98).\n   - **Total for Two-Digit:**\n     - 4's: 10 + 9 = 19.\n     - 8's: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Difference: 0.**\n\n3. **Three-Digit Page Numbers (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n     - 8 appears 0 times.\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - For hundreds digits 1,2,3: 10 each for 4 and 8, totaling 30 each.\n     - For hundreds digit 4: 4 appears 10 times (440-449), 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n     - **Total:**\n       - 4's: 30 + 10 = 40.\n       - 8's: 30 + 9 = 39.\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - For hundreds digits 1,2,3: 10 each for 4 and 8, totaling 30 each.\n     - For hundreds digit 4: 4 appears 9 times, 8 appears 9 times.\n     - **Total:**\n       - 4's: 30 + 9 = 39.\n       - 8's: 30 + 9 = 39.\n   - **Total for Three-Digit:**\n     - 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n     - 8's: 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n   - **Difference: 168 - 78 = 90.**\n\n4. **Combined Counts:**\n   - **4's:**\n     - One-digit: 1.\n     - Two-digit: 19.\n     - Three-digit: 168.\n     - **Total: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.**\n   - **8's:**\n     - One-digit: 1.\n     - Two-digit: 19.\n     - Three-digit: 78.\n     - **Total: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.**\n   - **Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.**\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by understanding the range of page numbers. The book has pages from 1 to 488. So, pages 1 through 9 are single-digit, 10 through 99 are two-digit, and 100 through 488 are three-digit numbers. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each of these ranges and do the same for the digit 8, then subtract the two totals to find the difference.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: these are 1 to 9. In this range, the digit 4 appears exactly once, which is on page 4. The digit 8 also appears once, on page 8. So, in single-digit pages, both 4 and 8 occur once. The difference here is zero.\n\nNext, moving on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place and the units place separately.\n\nFor the tens place in two-digit numbers, the digit can be from 1 to 9. So, for 4 in the tens place, the numbers are 40 to 49, which is 10 numbers. That means the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, for 8 in the tens place, the numbers are 80 to 89, another 10 numbers, so 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in each ten's group. So, for each ten's group (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. There are 9 such groups (from 10-99), so 4 appears 9 times in the units place. The same logic applies to 8, so 8 also appears 9 times in the units place.\n\nAdding up the counts for two-digit numbers: 4 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times, and 8 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times. So, again, the difference in two-digit pages is zero.\n\nNow, onto the three-digit page numbers, which go from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because each digit place (hundreds, tens, units) can vary, and the range doesn't go up to 999 but stops at 488.\n\nLet me break this down by each digit place: hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. In three-digit numbers from 100 to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, for the digit 4 in the hundreds place, the numbers range from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the hundreds digit only goes up to 4. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place. For three-digit numbers, the tens digit can be from 0 to 9, but I have to consider the range up to 488. Let's first calculate how many times 4 appears in the tens place. \n\nFrom 100 to 399, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3. For each of these, the tens digit can be 0-9, so for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, 340-349). Since there are three hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), that's 3 * 10 = 30 times.\n\nNow, for 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. The tens digit can be 0-8 (since 488 is the maximum). So, in 400-488, the digit 4 in the tens place occurs from 440 to 449, which is 10 numbers. So, total for the tens place, 4 appears 30 + 10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, for the digit 8 in the tens place. Again, from 100 to 399, each hundred has a set where the tens digit is 8, like 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these contributes 10 numbers, so 3 * 10 = 30 times.\n\nIn 400-488, the tens digit can go up to 8, so the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here.\n\nAdding up, 8 appears 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check that. When calculating for 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8, so when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, yes, 9 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place for three-digit numbers.\n\nFor the digit 4 in the units place: from 100 to 399, each hundred has 10 numbers where the units digit is 4 (like 104, 114, ..., 194; similarly for 200s and 300s). So, 3 hundreds * 10 = 30 times.\n\nIn 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Let's count how many that is. From 400-488, the units digit cycles every 10, so starting at 404, then 414, etc., up to 484. How many are there? Let's see: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers. So, total units place 4's: 30 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nFor the digit 8 in the units place: from 100 to 399, each hundred has 10 numbers where the units digit is 8, so 3 * 10 = 30 times.\n\nIn 400-488, the units digit 8 occurs in 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. Let's count: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers. So, units place 8's: 30 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, but hold on, in 400-488, the units digit 8 occurs in 408 up to 488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so starting at 408, then 418, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 408 is the first, then adding 10 each time: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers, as I thought earlier.\n\nSo, for the units place, 4 appears 39 times and 8 appears 39 times as well.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place in three-digit numbers.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\n- Tens place: 40 times\n- Units place: 39 times\nTotal 4's = 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 times.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\n- Tens place: 39 times\n- Units place: 39 times\nTotal 8's = 0 + 39 + 39 = 78 times.\n\nWait, but let me double-check these numbers because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place: 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. That seems correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nTens place for 4: from 100-399, 3 hundreds, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so 3*10=30. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 30 + 10 = 40. That seems right.\n\nUnits place for 4: 30 from 100-399, and 9 from 400-488, totaling 39. That looks correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Tens place: 30 from 100-399, and 9 from 400-488, totaling 39.\n- Units place: 30 from 100-399, and 9 from 400-488, totaling 39.\nSo, 39 + 39 = 78. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 168, and total 8's: 78.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtracting the two: 168 - 78 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything in the two-digit numbers. Earlier, I thought two-digit numbers had 19 4's and 19 8's, but let me recount that.\n\nIn two-digit numbers (10-99):\n- Tens place: 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n- Units place: For each ten's group (10-19, 20-29, etc.), 4 appears once, so 9 groups (from 10-99) gives 9 times. Similarly, 8 appears 9 times in the units place.\n\nSo, total 4's: 10 + 9 = 19, and 8's: 10 + 9 = 19. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, adding the single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit counts.\n\nSingle-digit:\n- 4: 1\n- 8: 1\n\nTwo-digit:\n- 4: 19\n- 8: 19\n\nThree-digit:\n- 4: 168\n- 8: 78\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, no, that's not right. Because in three-digit numbers, I think I made a mistake in the total counts. Wait, in three-digit numbers, the counts for 4 and 8 are as I calculated, but I think I need to add all digits across all page numbers.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the three-digit numbers, the counts for 4 and 8 are correct as I calculated. So, total 4's across all page numbers would be single-digit + two-digit + three-digit.\n\nWait, no, single-digit and two-digit are separate from three-digit. So, let me correct that.\n\nWait, no, single-digit and two-digit are included in the three-digit counts? No, no, single-digit pages are 1-9, two-digit are 10-99, and three-digit are 100-488. So, I should sum the counts from each category.\n\nSo, total 4's:\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\nTotal: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\nTotal: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, so 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, earlier when I was calculating three-digit numbers, I got 168 for 4's and 78 for 8's, but that was just for three-digit numbers. So, I need to add the single-digit and two-digit counts to get the total.\n\nWait, but let me check again. When I calculated three-digit numbers, I considered 100-488, so the counts for 4's and 8's in three-digit are correct. Then, adding single and two-digit counts.\n\nSo, 4's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 1 + 19 = 20 + 168 = 188.\n\n8's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 1 + 19 = 20 + 78 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the three-digit counts because that's where most of the numbers come from.\n\nFor 4's in three-digit numbers:\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n- Tens place: 40 times.\n- Units place: 39 times.\nTotal: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's in three-digit numbers:\n- Hundreds place: 0 times.\n- Tens place: 39 times.\n- Units place: 39 times.\nTotal: 78 times.\n\nYes, that adds up. So, 168 + 19 + 1 = 188 for 4's, and 78 + 19 + 1 = 98 for 8's.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for three-digit numbers. Let me check again.\n\nFor 4's in the tens place in three-digit numbers:\n\nFrom 100-399, each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 4, so 3*10=30.\n\nIn 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 30 + 10 = 40. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place:\n\nFrom 100-399, 3*10=30.\n\nIn 400-488, tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, 30 + 9 = 39. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's:\n\nFrom 100-399: 3*10=30.\n\nIn 400-488: 404, 414, ..., 484. Let's count: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers, so 30 + 9 = 39. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 8's:\n\nFrom 100-399: 3*10=30.\n\nIn 400-488: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers, so 30 + 9 = 39. Correct.\n\nSo, 4's in three-digit: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\n8's in three-digit: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nAdding single and two-digit:\n\n4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\n8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought of three-digit numbers, I had 168 4's and 78 8's, but when adding single and two-digit, I get 188 and 98. So, the difference is 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - 4 appears once (page 4).\n   - 8 appears once (page 8).\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **4's:** 10 times in the tens place (40-49) and 9 times in the units place (one in each ten's group).\n   - **8's:** 10 times in the tens place (80-89) and 9 times in the units place (one in each ten's group).\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **4's:**\n     - Hundreds place: 89 times (400-488).\n     - Tens place: 40 times (30 from 100-399 and 10 from 400-488).\n     - Units place: 39 times (30 from 100-399 and 9 from 400-488).\n     - Total: 168 times.\n   - **8's:**\n     - Hundreds place: 0 times.\n     - Tens place: 39 times (30 from 100-399 and 9 from 400-488).\n     - Units place: 39 times (30 from 100-399 and 9 from 400-488).\n     - Total: 78 times.\n\n4. **Total counts:**\n   - **4's:** 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n   - **8's:** 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with one-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digits are just 1 through 9, so each digit appears exactly once. That means the number of 4's here is 1, and the number of 8's is also 1. So, so far, the count is 1 four and 1 eight, making the difference zero.\n\nNext, moving on to two-digit page numbers, which go from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I think I should calculate how many times each digit appears in both places separately.\n\nFor the tens place in two-digit numbers, the digits range from 1 to 9. So, for each digit (including 4 and 8), there are 10 numbers where that digit is in the tens place. For example, 40-49 have 4 in the tens place, which is 10 times. Similarly, 80-89 have 8 in the tens place, also 10 times. So, that's 10 fours and 10 eights from the tens place.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 9 times (since there are 9 sets of ten numbers, like 10-19, 20-29, etc.). Wait, actually, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. For two-digit numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears in the units place exactly 9 times because there are 9 decades (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99). So, for each digit, it appears 9 times in the units place. Therefore, 4 appears 9 times and 8 appears 9 times in the units place of two-digit numbers.\n\nAdding that up for two-digit numbers: in the tens place, 10 fours and 10 eights; in the units place, 9 fours and 9 eights. So, total for two-digit numbers, fours are 10 + 9 = 19, and eights are 10 + 9 = 19. So, again, the difference is zero.\n\nNow, onto three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is where things get a bit more complicated because the range isn't a full set of three-digit numbers. Let me break this down by hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book has 488 pages. So, let's consider each hundred separately.\n\n- For hundreds digit 1 (pages 100-199): Each digit from 0-9 appears in the tens and units places. So, for the hundreds place, it's fixed at 1, but we're looking at the other digits. So, in this range, how many times does 4 appear in the tens and units places, and how many times does 8 appear?\n\nWait, maybe it's better to approach this systematically. Let me consider each digit place separately for three-digit numbers.\n\nHundreds place: 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nTens place: 0-9.\n\nUnits place: 0-9.\n\nBut since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, but when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can only go up to 8, and the units digit can only go up to 8 as well. Hmm, that complicates things a bit because 488 isn't a full three-digit number set.\n\nLet me handle the hundreds digit first.\n\nCase 1: Hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3.\n\nFor each of these, the number of pages is 100 each (100-199, 200-299, 300-399). So, each of these has 100 numbers, each with three digits.\n\nIn each hundred block (100-199, etc.), the number of 4's and 8's can be calculated as follows.\n\nIn the hundreds place: For 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's here. Similarly for 200-299, it's 2, and so on.\n\nIn the tens place: For each hundred block, the tens digit cycles through 0-9, each appearing 10 times. So, for each digit in the tens place, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times per hundred block.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place: Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times per hundred block, so 4 and 8 each appear 10 times per hundred block.\n\nTherefore, for each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the number of 4's is 10 (tens) + 10 (units) = 20, and the same for 8's: 20.\n\nSince there are three such blocks (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the total number of 4's and 8's from these blocks would be 3 * 20 = 60 for each digit. So, 60 fours and 60 eights.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds digit 4, which is pages 400-488.\n\nThis is a partial hundred block, so I need to calculate how many 4's and 8's appear in the tens and units places from 400 to 488.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place: 4 appears in the hundreds place for all these pages, so that's 89 times (from 400 to 488 inclusive). Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages, so that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But since we're only counting the number of 4's and 8's in all digit places, the hundreds digit contributes 89 fours, but we're looking for how many 4's and 8's are printed, so the hundreds digit contributes 89 fours, but we're interested in the count of 4's and 8's in all digit places. Wait, no, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 pages, so that's 89 fours right there. But let me confirm: pages 400 to 488 are 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nBut wait, the problem is about how many more 4's are printed than 8's, so I need to count all occurrences of 4 and 8 in all digit places.\n\nSo, let's break down the 400-488 range.\n\nFirst, hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, contributing 89 fours.\n\nNow, tens place: The tens digit in 400-488 can be from 0 to 8. Wait, no, 400-488 includes 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. So, the tens digit can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Each of these digits appears a certain number of times in the tens place.\n\nWait, let's see: From 400-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8, but the last set is only up to 488, so the tens digit 8 appears only up to 488, which is 488 being the last page.\n\nSo, for the tens place:\n\n- Tens digit 0: pages 400-409 \u2192 10 pages\n- Tens digit 1: pages 410-419 \u2192 10 pages\n- Tens digit 2: pages 420-429 \u2192 10 pages\n- Tens digit 3: pages 430-439 \u2192 10 pages\n- Tens digit 4: pages 440-449 \u2192 10 pages\n- Tens digit 5: pages 450-459 \u2192 10 pages\n- Tens digit 6: pages 460-469 \u2192 10 pages\n- Tens digit 7: pages 470-479 \u2192 10 pages\n- Tens digit 8: pages 480-488 \u2192 9 pages (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, each tens digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nNow, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place in 400-488.\n\nLooking at the tens digits:\n\n- Tens digit 4: appears 10 times (440-449)\n- Tens digit 8: appears 9 times (480-488)\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nNow, moving to the units place in 400-488.\n\nEach page number from 400 to 488 has a units digit from 0-9, but the last page is 488, so let's see how many times each digit appears.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to consider each tens group and count the units digits.\n\nFor each tens group (e.g., 400-409, 410-419, etc.), the units digit cycles through 0-9, except for the last group, which is 480-488, where the units digit goes up to 8.\n\nSo, for the units place:\n\n- For tens digits 0-7 (i.e., 400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479), each group has 10 units digits, so each digit 0-9 appears once per group. So, for each of these 8 groups, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 appears once in the units place.\n\n- For the tens digit 8 (480-488), the units digits go from 0 to 8, so digits 0-8 appear once each, but 9 doesn't appear. So, in this group, the digit 4 appears once (at 484), and the digit 8 appears once (at 488).\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nWait, in 480-488, the units digits are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, each digit from 0-8 appears once, so 4 appears once, and 8 appears once.\n\nSo, in total, for the units place:\n\n- For the first 8 groups (tens digits 0-7), each has 10 numbers, so 8 groups * 1 occurrence of 4 = 8 fours, and similarly 8 eights.\n\n- For the last group (tens digit 8), 1 four and 1 eight.\n\nSo, total in units place: 8 + 1 = 9 fours, and 8 + 1 = 9 eights.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, for each of the first 8 groups (tens digits 0-7), each group has 10 units digits, so each digit 0-9 appears once per group. So, for each group, 4 appears once in the units place, and 8 appears once. So, 8 groups * 1 = 8 fours and 8 eights.\n\nThen, for the last group (tens digit 8), which has 9 units digits (0-8), so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, adding 1 four and 1 eight.\n\nSo, total in units place: 8 + 1 = 9 fours, and 8 + 1 = 9 eights.\n\nWait, but that would mean in the units place, 4 appears 9 times and 8 appears 9 times in the 400-488 range.\n\nBut let me confirm by another method. The total number of units digits in 400-488 is 89 (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each digit from 0-9 appears approximately 8 or 9 times. Specifically, digits 0-8 appear 9 times each, and 9 appears 8 times because the last page is 488, which is 488, so 9 doesn't appear in the units place beyond 489, which doesn't exist here.\n\nWait, no, 489 would be beyond 488, so in 400-488, the units digits go up to 8 in the last page, so digit 9 doesn't appear at all in the units place. So, digits 0-8 each appear 9 times, and 9 appears 8 times (from 409, 419, ..., 489, but 489 is beyond 488, so actually, 9 appears only 8 times: 409,419,429,439,449,459,469,479). So, 8 times.\n\nBut in our case, we're only interested in 4's and 8's. So, in the units place, 4 appears 9 times (once in each of the 9 groups: 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488), and 8 appears 9 times as well (once in each of the 9 groups).\n\nWait, no, in the first 8 groups (tens digits 0-7), each has a units digit of 4 and 8, so that's 8 each. Then, in the last group (tens digit 8), units digits go up to 8, so 484 and 488, which adds 1 four and 1 eight. So, total 9 fours and 9 eights in the units place.\n\nSo, in the units place, 4 appears 9 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for the 400-488 range.\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 fours (since every page from 400-488 has a hundreds digit of 4)\n- Tens place: 10 fours (from 440-449) and 9 eights (from 480-488)\n- Units place: 9 fours and 9 eights\n\nSo, total fours in 400-488:\n\nHundreds: 89\nTens: 10\nUnits: 9\nTotal: 89 + 10 + 9 = 108 fours\n\nTotal eights in 400-488:\n\nHundreds: 0 (since hundreds digit is 4)\nTens: 9\nUnits: 9\nTotal: 0 + 9 + 9 = 18 eights\n\nWait, that seems off because earlier I thought in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times, and in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 9 times. So, adding up:\n\nFours: 89 (hundreds) + 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 108\nEights: 0 (hundreds) + 9 (tens) + 9 (units) = 18\n\nSo, in the 400-488 range, there are 108 fours and 18 eights.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the ranges:\n\n- One-digit: 1 four, 1 eight\n- Two-digit: 19 fours, 19 eights\n- Three-digit (100-399): 60 fours, 60 eights\n- Three-digit (400-488): 108 fours, 18 eights\n\nAdding them up:\n\nFours: 1 + 19 + 60 + 108 = 188\nEights: 1 + 19 + 60 + 18 = 98\n\nSo, the total number of fours is 188, and the total number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, one-digit: 1 four, 1 eight. Correct.\n\nTwo-digit: For tens place, each digit 1-9 appears 10 times, so 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times. In units place, each digit 0-9 appears 9 times (since there are 9 groups of ten), so 4 appears 9 times, 8 appears 9 times. So, total in two-digit: 10+9=19 fours, 10+9=19 eights. Correct.\n\nThree-digit (100-399): Each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) contributes 20 fours and 20 eights each. So, 3 blocks * 20 = 60 fours, 60 eights. Correct.\n\nThree-digit (400-488): Hundreds place: 89 fours. Tens place: 10 fours (440-449) and 9 eights (480-488). Units place: 9 fours and 9 eights. So, 89 + 10 + 9 = 108 fours; 0 + 9 + 9 = 18 eights. Correct.\n\nAdding up:\n\nFours: 1 + 19 + 60 + 108 = 188\n\nEights: 1 + 19 + 60 + 18 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe total number of 4's printed is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by understanding how many digits each page number has. Pages 1 through 9 are single-digit numbers, pages 10 through 99 are two-digit, and pages 100 through 488 are three-digit. So, I can approach this problem by considering each category separately: single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit page numbers. For each category, I'll count how many times the digit 4 appears and how many times the digit 8 appears, then find the difference.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digits 4 and 8 each appear exactly once. So, the count for 4 is 1 and for 8 is also 1. The difference here is 0.\n\nNext, moving on to two-digit page numbers, which range from 10 to 99. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place and the units place separately.\n\nLet's first look at the tens place. For two-digit numbers, the tens digit can be from 1 to 9. When the tens digit is 4, the numbers are 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 80-89, another 10 numbers, so 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers. The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each tens digit. So, for each set of ten numbers (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for 8 (like 18, 28, etc.). Since there are 9 sets of ten in two-digit numbers (10-99), each digit (4 and 8) appears 9 times in the units place. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, each digit appears once per ten numbers, and there are 9 tens (10-99), so 9 times each. So, 4 appears 9 times in the units place and 8 appears 9 times as well. \n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, the total count for 4 is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. Similarly, for 8, it's 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. So, the difference in two-digit numbers is also 0.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because each number has three digits: hundreds, tens, and units. I'll need to count the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each of these places.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book has 488 pages. So, the hundreds digit ranges from 1 to 4.\n\n- When the hundreds digit is 4, the numbers are from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the hundreds digit only goes up to 4, so 8 never appears here.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0 through 9, and the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nFor each hundreds digit (1, 2, 3, 4), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, for each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the digit in the tens place cycles 0-9. \n\nLet's first count for 4 in the tens place. For each hundreds group (except maybe the last one, 400-488), the tens digit 4 appears exactly once every 10 numbers, and there are 10 such groups per hundreds. Wait, no, that's not accurate. For each hundreds group, there are 10 possible tens digits, so for each hundreds group, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (like 140-149, 240-249, etc.), but actually, each tens digit appears 10 times per hundreds group. Wait, no, in each hundreds group, the tens digit 4 appears for 10 numbers (e.g., 140-149), so that's 10 occurrences. Since there are 4 hundreds groups (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), but wait, 400-488 isn't a full hundreds group; it's only up to 488. So, let me adjust.\n\nFor hundreds groups 100-199, 200-299, and 300-399, each is a full set of 100 numbers, so each has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. That's 3 groups \u00d7 10 = 30 times. Now, for the 400-488 group, the tens digit can go from 0 to 8 because 488 is the last page. So, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 times. So, total for 4 in the tens place is 30 + 10 = 40.\n\nNow, for 8 in the tens place. Similarly, in each full hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit 8 appears in 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each 10 times, so 3 groups \u00d7 10 = 30 times. In the 400-488 group, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here. So, total for 8 in the tens place is 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. In 400-488, the tens digit can be 0 to 8, because 488 is the last page. So, when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place in the 400-488 group. So, total 30 (from the first three groups) + 9 = 39.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each combination of hundreds and tens digits. So, for each hundreds group, each tens group, the units digit 4 and 8 each appear once every 10 numbers.\n\nLet's first count 4 in the units place. For each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), and for each tens digit (0-9), the units digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, in each hundreds group, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? For each hundreds group, there are 10 possible tens digits, and for each, the units digit 4 appears once, so 10 times per hundreds group. Since there are 4 hundreds groups, but wait, 400-488 is not a full hundreds group; it's only up to 488. So, let's adjust.\n\nFor the first three hundreds groups (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each is a full 100 numbers, so each has 10 occurrences of 4 in the units place. That's 3 \u00d7 10 = 30.\n\nNow, for the 400-488 group, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The units digit cycles 0-9 for each tens digit. Since the last page is 488, the tens digits go up to 8. So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, the units digit 4 appears once. That's 9 tens digits \u00d7 1 occurrence each = 9 times. So, total for 4 in the units place is 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nNow, for 8 in the units place. Similarly, in each full hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each has 10 occurrences of 8 in the units place, so 3 \u00d7 10 = 30.\n\nIn the 400-488 group, the units digit 8 appears once for each tens digit from 0 to 8. So, that's 9 occurrences. So, total for 8 in the units place is 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check that again. In the 400-488 group, the units digit 8 appears in numbers like 408, 418, ..., 488. But since the last page is 488, that's included. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place here? It's once for each tens digit from 0 to 8, so 9 times. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, putting it all together for three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4 in hundreds place: 89 times\n- 4 in tens place: 40 times\n- 4 in units place: 39 times\nTotal 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\n- 8 in hundreds place: 0 times\n- 8 in tens place: 39 times\n- 8 in units place: 39 times\nTotal 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, earlier I thought 4 in the tens place was 40 and 8 in the tens place was 39, but when adding up, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, in the tens place, for 4's, I had 30 from the first three hundreds groups and 10 from the 400-488 group, totaling 40. For 8's, I had 30 from the first three groups and 9 from the 400-488 group, totaling 39. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, 4's: 30 from first three groups, 9 from 400-488, total 39. 8's: 30 from first three groups, 9 from 400-488, total 39.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n\nTotal 8's in three-digit numbers: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's and 8's across all page numbers.\n\nSingle-digit:\n- 4: 1\n- 8: 1\n\nTwo-digit:\n- 4: 19\n- 8: 19\n\nThree-digit:\n- 4: 168\n- 8: 78\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nNow, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nFirst, single-digit: 1 each, correct.\n\nTwo-digit: 4's: tens place 10 (40-49), units place 9 (14,24,...,94). Wait, 94 is the 9th occurrence, so 9 times. So, 10 + 9 = 19. Similarly for 8's: 10 (80-89) + 9 (18,28,...,98) = 19. So, that's correct.\n\nThree-digit:\n\n4's:\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n- Tens place: For each hundreds group except 400-488, 10 times each (3 groups \u00d710=30). For 400-488, tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10. Total 30+10=40.\n- Units place: For each hundreds group, 10 times each (3 groups \u00d710=30). For 400-488, units digit 4 appears 9 times (since tens digits go up to 8, so 404,414,...,484: that's 9 numbers). So, 30+9=39.\nTotal 4's: 89+40+39=168.\n\n8's:\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n- Tens place: For each of the first three hundreds groups, 10 times each (3\u00d710=30). For 400-488, tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. Total 30+9=39.\n- Units place: For each of the first three hundreds groups, 10 times each (3\u00d710=30). For 400-488, units digit 8 appears 9 times (408,418,...,488). So, 30+9=39.\nTotal 8's: 0+39+39=78.\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 (single) +19 (two-digit) +168 (three-digit) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 1 (single) +19 (two-digit) +78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - 4 appears once.\n   - 8 appears once.\n   - Difference: 0.\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears 9 times (14,24,...,94), 8 appears 9 times (18,28,...,98).\n   - Total 4's: 19, Total 8's: 19.\n   - Difference: 0.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n   - Total 4's: 168, Total 8's: 78.\n   - Difference: 168 - 78 = 90.\n\n4. **Total counts:**\n   - 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n   - 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by understanding the range of page numbers. The book has 488 pages, so the page numbers go from 1 to 488. That means the page numbers can be 1-digit (1-9), 2-digit (10-99), or 3-digit (100-488). I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for the digit 8, then find the difference.\n\nStarting with the digit 4. I'll consider each position separately.\n\n1. **Units place for 4:**\n   - For every set of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. \n   - From page 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, I think it's 48 times, but wait, actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, page 488 is included, so does that add an extra 4? Wait, 488 is a three-digit number ending with 88, so the units digit is 8, so no, the last set is 481-488, which ends at 488, so the units digit 4 occurs at 484, which is within that set. So yes, 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place for 4:**\n   - Similarly, for the tens place, every block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. For example, from 40-49, each number has a 4 in the tens place, which is 10 numbers.\n   - So, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 400-488.\n   - Each of the first four hundreds contributes 10 times 4 in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 0 for 400-409, 1 for 410-419, and so on up to 8 for 480-488. But since we're looking for 4 in the tens place, that would be from 440-449. That's another 10 numbers.\n   - So total for tens place is 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place for 4:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the occurrences of 4:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Wait, in the units place, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me recalculate:\n\n- For units place, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, and then in the 481-488 range, 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place, so that's 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, so the units digit cycles every 10. So from 1 to 480, there are 480 numbers, which is 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place:\n\n- From 1 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n- There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40.\n- Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10.\n- So total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\n- From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nWait, that's different from my initial 187. I think I miscounted earlier. So units place is 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place for 8:**\n   - Similar to 4, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - From 1 to 488, that's 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48 times.\n   - Then, in 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which is another 8 in the units place.\n   - So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place for 8:**\n   - Every 100 numbers, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40.\n   - Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), but wait, the tens digit is 8, so it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 occurrences. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but 480 is the first, 481, ..., 488. So that's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So that's 9.\n\n   So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place for 8:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So 0 occurrences.\n\nNow, adding up all the occurrences of 8:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, let me check the tens place again. From 1 to 488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges contributes 10, so 4*10=40, and the last one is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98.\n\nThe difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 188 and 8's were 98, so the difference is 90. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's.\n\nWait, in the units place for 4, I had 49, which is correct because from 1-480, 48 times, plus 484 in 481-488, so 49.\n\nIn the tens place, 50, which is 4*10=40 plus 10 in 440-449, correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 89, correct because from 400-488, that's 89 numbers.\n\nSo 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's, units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds 0, total 98.\n\nSo 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the 8's again. In the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place, correct. So 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers. So 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nYes, so 4's:188, 8's:98, difference 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 188, 8's 98, so 90 more 4's.\n\nWait, but let me check the 4's again. Units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct.\n\n8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98.\n\nSo yes, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but wait, I'm a bit confused because when I first thought about it, I thought maybe the hundreds place for 8's would contribute, but it doesn't because the book only goes up to 488. So 8's in hundreds place:0.\n\nSo the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of 10, contributing 48 occurrences, plus one more in 484, totaling 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times in each block of 100 (e.g., 40-49). With four full hundreds contributing 40, plus 10 in 440-449, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears 10 times in each block of 100, contributing 40, plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit within 1-488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I'll start by analyzing each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That might make it easier to count the occurrences of 4's and 8's in each place. \n\nStarting with the units place, since every 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, for example, in the numbers 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same for 8. \n\nNow, how many sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, we'll consider 48 full sets, which take us up to page 480. Then, there are 8 more pages from 481 to 488. \n\nIn each full set of 10, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 sets, that's 48 times 1 each, so 48 4's and 48 8's from the units place. \n\nNow, looking at the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, the units digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). So, adding that, we have 49 4's and 49 8's from the units place. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me correct that. \n\nWait, the first 480 pages have 48 sets of 10, giving 48 4's and 48 8's. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 4's: 48 +1=49, and 8's: 48 +1=49. So, in the units place, they're equal, 49 each. \n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit goes through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89). \n\nSo, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each full hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times. So, for 4 full hundreds, that's 4*10=40 4's and 4*10=40 8's in the tens place. \n\nNow, looking at the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488, so the tens digit is 8 for those). \n\nWait, let me think again. From 401 to 488, the tens digits cycle as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nSo, in this range, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's from 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place from 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, that's 8 numbers (481-488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 for all these, so how many times does 8 appear? It's 8 times because from 481 to 488, that's 8 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. \n\nWait, no. Wait, each of these numbers has 8 in the tens place, so for 481-488, that's 8 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the tens place. So, 8 times. \n\nSo, in the tens place, from 401-488, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times. \n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 40 (from full hundreds) +10=50\nTotal tens place 8's: 40 (from full hundreds) +8=48\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's are 50, 8's are 48. So, 4's are 2 more than 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit changes every 1000 numbers, but since our book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. \n\nWait, let me clarify. The page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the hundreds digit is:\n\n- 0 for pages 1-99\n- 1 for pages 100-199\n- 2 for pages 200-299\n- 3 for pages 300-399\n- 4 for pages 400-488\n\nSo, how many times does each hundreds digit appear?\n\n- 0: 99 times (pages 1-99)\n- 1: 100 times (100-199)\n- 2: 100 times (200-299)\n- 3: 100 times (300-399)\n- 4: 89 times (400-488, which is 89 pages)\n\nWait, 400 to 488 is 89 pages, because 488 - 400 +1 = 89.\n\nNow, in the hundreds place, we're looking for when the digit is 4 or 8. \n\nBut wait, in the hundreds place, the digits are 0,1,2,3,4. There's no 8 in the hundreds place because 800 would be page 800, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit 8 doesn't appear at all. So, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nOn the other hand, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times, from 400 to 488.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's:89, 8's:0.\n\nSo, 4's are 89 more than 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- 4's:49\n- 8's:49\n\nTens place:\n- 4's:50\n- 8's:48\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's:89\n- 8's:0\n\nNow, total 4's: 49 +50 +89 = 188\nTotal 8's:49 +48 +0 = 97\n\nWait, let me add that again:\n\n4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188\n\n8's: units (49) + tens (48) + hundreds (0) = 49+48=97\n\nSo, total 4's:188, total 8's:97\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 -97=91\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place: 48 full sets of 10, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8. So, 48 each. Then, from 481-488, units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units:49 each.\n\nTens place: Each full hundred (4 of them) contributes 10 4's and 10 8's, so 40 each. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 times. So, tens:4's=40+10=50, 8's=40+8=48.\n\nHundreds place: 4's appear from 400-488, which is 89 times. 8's:0.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me recount the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 -400 +1=89 pages. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 is in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 full sets of 10, so 48 each, plus in the last 8 pages, 484 and 488, so one each. So, 49 each. Correct.\n\nSo, yeah, 188 4's and 97 8's, difference is 91.\n\nI think that's it. So, the answer is 91.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Units Place Analysis:**\n   - Each set of 10 pages (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) has one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n   - Total full sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 sets (up to page 480).\n   - 48 sets contribute 48 4's and 48 8's.\n   - Pages 481-488 add one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - Total units place: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place Analysis:**\n   - Each hundred (e.g., 1-100) has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - 4 full hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - Pages 401-488:\n     - 441-450: 10 4's.\n     - 481-488: 8 8's.\n   - Total tens place: 50 4's and 48 8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place Analysis:**\n   - Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, no 4's or 8's.\n   - Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, no 4's or 8's.\n   - Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, no 4's or 8's.\n   - Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, no 4's or 8's.\n   - Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times. No 8's in hundreds place.\n   - Total hundreds place: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with one-digit page numbers, those would be from 1 to 9. In this range, the digits 4 and 8 each appear once. So, for one-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 occur once. That means the count for 4's and 8's here is equal, so no difference yet.\n\nNext, let's look at two-digit page numbers, which go from 10 to 99. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place and the units place separately. \n\nFor the tens place: The numbers from 40 to 49 all have a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 pages, so 10 times the digit 4 appears. Similarly, the numbers from 80 to 89 have an 8 in the tens place, which is another 10 times. \n\nFor the units place: In the range 10 to 99, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 9 times in the units place (since for each ten, the units cycle through 0-9). So, for the digit 4, it appears 9 times in the units place, and the same goes for 8. \n\nWait, but hold on, in the two-digit numbers, the tens place for 4 and 8 is 10 times each, but the units place is 9 times each. So, for two-digit numbers, the total count for 4's is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19, and for 8's it's 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 as well. So, again, equal counts here. Hmm, that's interesting. So, in two-digit numbers, 4's and 8's are equal.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which go from 100 to 488. This is where it might get a bit more complicated because the range doesn't end at 999 but stops at 488. So, I need to be careful not to overcount beyond 488.\n\nLet me break down the three-digit numbers into hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book only goes up to 488, when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens and units digits can't exceed 88. So, I'll handle the hundreds place separately for 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\nFor hundreds digit 1, 2, 3: Each of these will have all possible two-digit numbers in the tens and units places, from 00 to 99. So, for each of these hundreds digits, the number of times 4 and 8 appear in the tens and units places can be calculated similarly to the two-digit case.\n\nBut when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can only go up to 8, because 488 is the last page. So, I need to adjust for that.\n\nLet me start by considering hundreds digits 1, 2, 3.\n\nFor hundreds digits 1, 2, 3:\n\nEach of these hundreds digits will have 100 numbers each (from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399). For each hundred, the tens and units places can be any digit from 0 to 9. So, similar to the two-digit case, the digit 4 will appear in the tens place 10 times (40-49) and in the units place 10 times (once every ten numbers). Similarly, the digit 8 will appear 10 times in the tens place and 10 times in the units place. So, for each hundred, the count of 4's is 10 (tens) + 10 (units) = 20, and the same for 8's.\n\nSince there are three such hundreds (1, 2, 3), the total for 4's and 8's in these ranges would be 3 * 20 = 60 each. So, both 4's and 8's have 60 counts here.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds digit 4, which covers pages 400 to 488.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds digit is 4. So, every page from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many times does 4 appear here? Well, from 400 to 488, there are 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's look at the tens and units places within 400 to 488.\n\nStarting with the tens place:\n\nThe tens digit can range from 0 to 8 because 488 is the last page. So, for the tens place, we have 9 possible digits (0-8), but since 488 is the limit, when the tens digit is 8, the units digit can only go up to 8, not 9.\n\nWait, actually, let me clarify. Pages go from 400 to 488. So, the tens digit can be 0 to 8. For each tens digit, the units digit can be 0 to 9 except when the tens digit is 8, where the units digit can only go up to 8.\n\nSo, let's break this down:\n\nFor tens digits 0 to 7: Each of these will have 10 possible units digits (0-9), so 10 numbers each.\n\nFor tens digit 8: Units digits go from 0 to 8, so 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total numbers from 400 to 488: 8 (tens digits 0-7) * 10 + 1 (tens digit 8) * 9 = 80 + 9 = 89, which checks out.\n\nNow, counting the number of 4's and 8's in the tens and units places within 400-488.\n\nFirst, the tens place:\n\nHow many times does 4 appear in the tens place? The tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, 4 appears once in the tens place (when the tens digit is 4). So, pages 440 to 449 have 4 in the tens place. That's 10 pages, so 10 times the digit 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Only when the tens digit is 8, which is pages 480 to 488. But wait, when the tens digit is 8, the units digit can only go up to 8, so that's 9 pages (480 to 488). So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the units place:\n\nHow many times does 4 appear in the units place? For each tens group (0-8), the units digit cycles through 0-9, except for the last group (tens digit 8) where it only goes up to 8.\n\nSo, for tens digits 0-7: Each has 10 units digits, so 4 appears once in each, so 8 times.\n\nFor tens digit 8: Units digits go up to 8, so 4 appears once here as well (page 484).\n\nWait, no, actually, in the tens digit 8 group, units digits go from 0 to 8, so 4 is included once (484). So, total 4's in the units place: 8 (from tens 0-7) + 1 (from tens 8) = 9 times.\n\nSimilarly, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? For each tens group 0-7: Each has 10 units digits, so 8 appears once in each, so 8 times.\n\nFor tens digit 8: Units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once here as well (page 488).\n\nWait, but page 488 is included, so 8 appears once in the units place for tens digit 8.\n\nSo, total 8's in the units place: 8 (from tens 0-7) + 1 (from tens 8) = 9 times.\n\nWait, but hold on, in the tens digit 8 group, the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once. So, yes, 9 times in total for 8's in the units place.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. For each tens group from 0 to 7, the units digit 8 appears once (e.g., 408, 418, ..., 478). That's 8 times. Then, in the tens digit 8 group, 488 is included, so that's one more. So, 8 + 1 = 9 times. Correct.\n\nSo, summarizing for the three-digit numbers where hundreds digit is 4:\n\n- 4's in the hundreds place: 89 times\n- 4's in the tens place: 10 times\n- 4's in the units place: 9 times\n- Total 4's: 89 + 10 + 9 = 108\n\n- 8's in the tens place: 9 times\n- 8's in the units place: 9 times\n- Total 8's: 9 + 9 = 18\n\nWait, but hold on, I think I made a mistake here. The 8's in the hundreds place: but the hundreds digit is 4, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place here. So, the 8's are only in the tens and units places, which we've calculated as 9 each, totaling 18.\n\nBut let me check again. So, for the hundreds digit 4, the 4's are 89 in the hundreds place, plus 10 in the tens place, plus 9 in the units place, totaling 108 4's.\n\nFor 8's, in the hundreds digit 4 range, the 8's are only in the tens and units places. We found 9 in the tens place (pages 480-488) and 9 in the units place (pages 408, 418, ..., 478, and 488). So, 9 + 9 = 18 8's.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so when counting the units place, 488 is counted as an 8 in the units place. So, yes, 9 times each.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the counts.\n\nFirst, one-digit numbers: 4 and 8 each appear once.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: 4's and 8's each appear 19 times.\n\nThree-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds digits 1,2,3: 4's and 8's each appear 60 times.\n- Hundreds digit 4: 4's appear 108 times, 8's appear 18 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 60 (hundreds 1-3) + 108 (hundreds 4) = 1 + 19 + 60 + 108 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 60 (hundreds 1-3) + 18 (hundreds 4) = 1 + 19 + 60 + 18 = 98.\n\nWait, let me add that again:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) = 20\n\n20 + 60 (hundreds 1-3) = 80\n\n80 + 108 (hundreds 4) = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) = 20\n\n20 + 60 (hundreds 1-3) = 80\n\n80 + 18 (hundreds 4) = 98\n\nSo, total 4's: 188\n\nTotal 8's: 98\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations because 90 seems high.\n\nWait, perhaps I overcounted the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. Then, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449). In the units place, 4 appears 9 times (once in each tens group except the last, which is 484). So, 89 + 10 + 9 = 108. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's in the hundreds digit 4 range, tens place: 9 times (480-488), units place: 9 times (408,418,...,478,488). So, 18 in total.\n\nSo, 4's total: 188\n\n8's total: 98\n\nDifference: 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the units place for 4's in the hundreds digit 4 range.\n\nWait, in the hundreds digit 4, the units digit 4 appears once in each tens group from 400-488. Let's see:\n\nFrom 400-409: 404\n\n410-419: 414\n\n420-429: 424\n\n430-439: 434\n\n440-449: 444 (but 444 is in the tens group 44, so it's counted in the tens place as well)\n\nWait, but I think I'm double-counting 444 here because it's being counted both in the tens place and the units place. But no, actually, each digit is counted separately. So, 444 has two 4's, so it's counted twice: once in the tens place and once in the units place. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I count the units place 4's, I'm considering each occurrence in the units place, regardless of the tens digit. So, in each tens group, 400-409, 410-419, etc., the units digit 4 appears once, so 8 times for tens groups 0-7, and once in tens group 8 (484). So, 9 times in total. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, it's 9 times as well.\n\nSo, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **One-Digit Page Numbers (1-9):**\n   - Each digit 4 and 8 appears once.\n   - Count of 4's: 1\n   - Count of 8's: 1\n\n2. **Two-Digit Page Numbers (10-99):**\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - 4 appears 10 times (40-49).\n     - 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - 4 appears 9 times (once in each ten: 14,24,...,94).\n     - 8 appears 9 times (once in each ten: 18,28,...,98).\n   - Total for two-digit numbers:\n     - 4's: 10 + 9 = 19\n     - 8's: 10 + 9 = 19\n\n3. **Three-Digit Page Numbers (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds Digits 1, 2, 3:**\n     - Each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) contributes:\n       - 4's: 20 (10 in tens, 10 in units)\n       - 8's: 20 (10 in tens, 10 in units)\n     - Total for hundreds 1-3:\n       - 4's: 3 * 20 = 60\n       - 8's: 3 * 20 = 60\n   - **Hundreds Digit 4 (400-488):**\n     - **Hundreds Place:**\n       - 4 appears 89 times (from 400 to 488).\n     - **Tens Place:**\n       - 4 appears 10 times (440-449).\n       - 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n     - **Units Place:**\n       - 4 appears 9 times (once in each ten, including 484).\n       - 8 appears 9 times (once in each ten, including 488).\n     - Total for hundreds digit 4:\n       - 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 108\n       - 8's: 9 (tens) + 9 (units) = 18\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **4's:**\n     - One-digit: 1\n     - Two-digit: 19\n     - Hundreds 1-3: 60\n     - Hundreds 4: 108\n     - **Total:** 1 + 19 + 60 + 108 = 188\n   - **8's:**\n     - One-digit: 1\n     - Two-digit: 19\n     - Hundreds 1-3: 60\n     - Hundreds 4: 18\n     - **Total:** 1 + 19 + 60 + 18 = 98\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 4's - 8's = 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "hit_max_tokens": true,
    "text": " \n\nLet me start by understanding the range of page numbers. The book starts at page 1 and goes up to page 488. So, the page numbers are from 1 to 488. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears, then find the difference between those two counts.\n\nI think the best approach is to analyze each digit position separately: the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place. That way, I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position and sum them up for the total count.\n\nStarting with the units place. For each group of ten consecutive numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place, and the same goes for the digit 8. \n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so I need to check how many complete groups of ten there are and if there's a partial group. Let me calculate how many groups of ten there are in 488 pages. \n\nThe total number of pages is 488, so the number of complete tens is 48 (since 48*10=480), and then there are 8 pages left (481-488). So, for the units place, in each of the 48 complete groups, both 4 and 8 appear once each in the units place. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). \n\nSo, for the units place, the count of 4's is 48 (from the complete groups) +1 (from the partial group) = 49. Similarly, the count of 8's is 48 +1 = 49. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. From 1 to 480, there are 48 groups of ten, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so that's 48 each. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1-8, so 484 has a 4 and 488 has an 8. So yes, that adds one more each, making it 49 each in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). In each hundred, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. So, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 pages, and the same for 8.\n\nBut let's see how many hundreds we have in 488 pages. There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each of the 4 complete hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), so that's 4*10 = 40 times for 4. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times per hundred, so 4*10 = 40 times for 8.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 (for 401-410) to 8 (for 481-490, but we only go up to 488). So, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nFrom 401-410: tens digit is 0\n411-420: tens digit is 1\n421-430: tens digit is 2\n431-440: tens digit is 3\n441-450: tens digit is 4\n451-460: tens digit is 5\n461-470: tens digit is 6\n471-480: tens digit is 7\n481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 times. But wait, 441-450 is 10 numbers, but 441 is the first, and 450 is the 10th. But in our case, the last page is 488, so 441-450 is entirely within 401-488, so that's 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears in the tens place from 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, that's 8 numbers (481-488), so the tens digit 8 appears 8 times here.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the tens digit is 8 for 481-490, but since we're only going up to 488, that's 8 numbers: 481, 482, ..., 488. So, the tens digit is 8 for all these, so that's 8 times.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, for each group of ten, the tens digit is the same. So, from 481-490, the tens digit is 8 for all 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 8 numbers, but the tens digit is still 8 for each of those 8 numbers. So, the count for 8 in the tens place in this partial hundred is 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, in the tens place, 4 appears 40 times from the complete hundreds, plus 10 times from 441-450, totaling 50 times. And 8 appears 40 times from the complete hundreds, plus 8 times from 481-488, totaling 48 times.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me check again. From 1-400, in the tens place, 4 appears 40 times (4 per hundred times 4 hundreds). Then, from 401-488, in the tens place, 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 times, so total 50 times for 4 in the tens place.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place, from 1-400, it's 40 times. Then, from 401-488, it's in 481-488, which is 8 times, so total 48 times. So, 50 times for 4 and 48 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because in the hundreds place, we have 401-488, which is the hundreds digit 4 for all these pages, right? So, maybe I should consider the hundreds place separately.\n\nWait, perhaps I should handle each digit position separately, so let's move on to the hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, the digits go from 1 to 4 because the book has 488 pages. So, pages 1-99 are one or two-digit numbers, but their hundreds digit is 0. Pages 100-199 have hundreds digit 1, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 4 only for pages 400-488. How many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (including both 400 and 488). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 times for 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. Since 488 is less than 500, the hundreds digit doesn't go beyond 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit position.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 48 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97 times\n\nWait, that can't be right because 188 - 97 is 91, which seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the tens place for the digit 4. Let me go back.\n\nIn the tens place, from 1-400, each hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 +10=50. That seems correct.\n\nFor the digit 8 in the tens place, from 1-400, it's 40 times. Then, from 401-488, it's in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 40 +8=48. That seems correct.\n\nIn the units place, I had 49 each, which seems correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -97 =91.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count or miss any numbers.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor the units digit:\n\nNumber of complete groups of ten: floor(488/10) =48 groups, each contributing one 4 and one 8. So, 48 each.\n\nThen, the remaining pages are 488 -48*10=488-480=8 pages, which are 481-488. The units digits here are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units digit total: 48+1=49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nFor the tens digit:\n\nNumber of complete groups of hundred: floor(488/100)=4 groups (1-100, 101-200, etc.), each contributing 10 times 4 and 10 times 8 in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 each.\n\nThen, the remaining pages are 488 -4*100=88 pages (401-488). In these 88 pages, the tens digit cycles from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but we stop at 488).\n\nSo, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? It appears in 441-450, which is 10 times.\n\nHow about 8? It appears in 481-488, which is 8 times.\n\nSo, total for tens digit: 40+10=50 for 4, and 40+8=48 for 8.\n\nFor the hundreds digit:\n\nOnly pages 400-488 have hundreds digit 4, which is 89 pages (488-400+1=89). So, 89 times for 4.\n\n8 never appears in the hundreds place, so 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188\n\n8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =97\n\nDifference:188-97=91\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n\nBut let me just cross-verify with another method. Maybe by considering each digit position and the number of times each digit appears.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of each digit position separately and compute the count.\n\nUnits place:\n\nTotal numbers:488\n\nNumber of times each digit 0-9 appears in units place: For each digit, it appears floor(488/10)=48 times, and then the remainder is 8, so digits 1-8 appear one more time.\n\nSo, digits 0 appears 48 times, digits 1-8 appear 48+1=49 times, and digits 9 appears 48 times.\n\nSo, 4 appears 49 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears floor(488/100)=4 times in the tens place, each contributing 10 times per digit.\n\nBut wait, floor(488/100)=4, so each digit 0-9 appears 4*10=40 times in the tens place.\n\nBut then, the remaining 88 pages (401-488) affect the tens digit.\n\nIn the tens place for 401-488:\n\nThe tens digit cycles from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490, but only up to 488).\n\nSo, for each ten group in 401-488, how many times does each digit appear?\n\nFrom 401-410: tens digit 0, 10 numbers\n411-420: tens digit 1, 10\n421-430: tens digit 2,10\n431-440: tens digit 3,10\n441-450: tens digit 4,10\n451-460: tens digit 5,10\n461-470: tens digit 6,10\n471-480: tens digit 7,10\n481-488: tens digit 8,8 numbers\n\nSo, in the tens place for 401-488:\n\nDigit 0:10\n1:10\n2:10\n3:10\n4:10\n5:10\n6:10\n7:10\n8:8\n\nSo, the total for the tens place in 401-488 is:\n\nDigit 4:10\nDigit 8:8\n\nSo, adding to the initial 40 times from the complete hundreds:\n\nDigit 4:40 +10=50\nDigit 8:40 +8=48\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times.\n\n8 never appears in the hundreds place, so 0.\n\nSo, total counts:\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n\n8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " So, I should probably look at each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every set of ten pages, like 1-10, 11-20, and so on, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place, right? Similarly, the digit 8 also appears once in the units place. So, for the units digit, the number of 4's and 8's should be the same. But wait, I need to check if the total number of pages is a multiple of ten or not. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, that means there are 48 full sets of ten and then 8 extra pages. So, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times, except for the last partial set where only 0 through 8 appear once. So, for the digit 4 in the units place, how many times does it appear? Well, in each full set of ten, it's once, so 48 times, and in the last partial set, pages 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more. So total units 4's are 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, units 8's are also 48 +1 =49. So, in the units place, they're equal.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, in each hundred, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. So, for the digit 4, it appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 pages. Similarly, for 8, it's 10 times. Now, since the book has 488 pages, that's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). So, in each of the 4 full hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4*10=40 times. Similarly, 8 appears 4*10=40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, in the tens place, 4 appears how many times? From 401-410, the tens digit is 0, 411-420 is 1, 421-430 is 2, 431-440 is 3, 441-450 is 4, 451-460 is 5, 461-470 is 6, 471-480 is 7, and 481-488 is 8. Wait, so in the tens place for 401-488, the digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 times. So, that adds another 10 times for 4 in the tens place. Similarly, 8 appears in 481-488, but that's only 8 pages, so the tens digit is 8 only 8 times? Wait, no, because 481-488 is 8 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for each of those, so 8 times. So, for the tens digit in 401-488, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me check again. From 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So, in the tens place, each digit from 0 to 8 appears exactly 10 times, except for 8, which appears 8 times because we stop at 488. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. Each set of 10 pages in the tens place would be 10 pages, but from 401 to 488, that's 88 pages, which is 8 sets of 10 pages plus 8 pages. So, the tens digits would be 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), and 8 (481-488). So, each of these tens digits appears exactly 10 times except for the last one, which appears 8 times because there are only 8 pages (481-488). So, for the tens digit, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place, the total number of 4's is 4*10 (from the first four hundreds) plus 10 (from 401-488), so 4*10=40 +10=50. And for 8's, it's 4*10=40 +8=48.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because in the first four hundreds, each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 for 4's and 4*10=40 for 8's. Then, in the last 88 pages (401-488), 4's in the tens place appear 10 times (from 441-450), and 8's appear 8 times (from 481-488). So, total 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50, and 8's: 40 +8=48.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 48 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, 400-488 would have hundreds digit 4. So, let me check: from 1-99, hundreds digit is 0 (since they are two-digit numbers), but wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 0 for all pages 1-99, because they are one or two-digit numbers. So, the hundreds digit becomes 1 from page 100 onwards, right? Wait, no, page 100 is the first three-digit page, so pages 1-99 are one or two-digit, so their hundreds digit is 0. Pages 100-199 have hundreds digit 1, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in the range of this book, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nNow, let me sum up all the occurrences of 4's and 8's across units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89 = 188 times.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 48 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's: 49 +48 +0 = 97 times.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from total 4's: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n- Each full set of 10 pages (1-10, 11-20, etc.) has one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n- There are 48 full sets (since 488 /10 =48.8), so 48 times each.\n- Then, the last partial set is pages 481-488, which is 8 pages. The units digits here are 1-8, so 4 appears once, and 8 appears once.\n- So, total units 4's: 48 +1=49\n- Similarly, units 8's:48 +1=49\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place, so 4 appears 10 times per hundred, same with 8.\n- There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so 4*10=40 for both 4 and 8.\n- In the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 times.\n- The tens digit 8 appears in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, that's 8 times.\n- So, total tens 4's: 40 +10=50\n- Total tens 8's:40 +8=48\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place, so 0.\n\nTotal 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 91 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - There are 48 full sets of 10 pages (480 pages) and 8 extra pages (481-488).\n   - 4 and 8 each appear 48 times in the units place from the full sets.\n   - In the last 8 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once.\n   - Total units 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total units 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - There are 4 full hundreds (400 pages), contributing 10 times each for 4 and 8.\n   - In the last 88 pages (401-488), 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n   - Total tens 4's: 4*10 + 10 = 50\n   - Total tens 8's: 4*10 + 8 = 48\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears from page 400 to 488, which is 89 times.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total hundreds 4's: 89\n   - Total hundreds 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with one-digit page numbers: these are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digit 4 appears once (which is page 4), and the digit 8 also appears once (page 8). So, for one-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 occur once each. That means the count for both is the same here, so no difference yet.\n\nNext, moving on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. I need to figure out how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens and units places separately. \n\nLet's start with the tens place. For two-digit numbers, the tens digit can be from 1 to 9. If the tens digit is 4, then the units digit can be anything from 0 to 9, giving us 10 numbers: 40-49. So, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, if the tens digit is 8, we have 80-89, which is another 10 numbers, so 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, looking at the units place for two-digit numbers. The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each tens group. So, in each set of ten numbers (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place (e.g., 14, 24, etc.). Since there are 9 sets of ten in two-digit numbers (10-99), the digit 4 appears 9 times in the units place. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the units place (e.g., 18, 28, etc.).\n\nWait, no, actually, wait. From 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers, which is 9 sets of 10. So, for each digit (4 and 8), in the units place, it's 9 times each. So, for two-digit numbers, 4 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times, and 8 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times. So, again, both 4 and 8 have the same count in two-digit numbers.\n\nWait, but hold on, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. For the units place, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly once every 10 numbers. Since there are 9 sets of 10 in two-digit numbers (10-99), each digit should appear 9 times in the units place. So, yes, 4 appears 9 times and 8 appears 9 times in the units place. So, total for two-digit numbers, 4 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19, and same for 8. So, same count again.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. Wait, but actually, the book has 488 pages, so the page numbers go up to 488, which is a three-digit number. So, I need to consider three-digit numbers from 100 to 488.\n\nLet me break this down into hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because 488 is the last page. So, for hundreds digits, let's consider each case:\n\n- Hundreds digit is 1: 100-199. Here, the digit 4 doesn't appear in the hundreds place, but 8 also doesn't. So, no contribution from the hundreds place for either digit here.\n\n- Hundreds digit is 2: 200-299. Similarly, neither 4 nor 8 is in the hundreds place, so no contribution.\n\n- Hundreds digit is 3: 300-399. Again, same as above, no 4 or 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n- Hundreds digit is 4: 400-488. Here, the hundreds digit is 4, so every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, for the digit 8 in the hundreds place: since the hundreds digits go up to 4, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8's count from the hundreds place is zero.\n\nNext, let's consider the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be from 0 to 9, and the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, but we have to be careful because the last set (400-488) only goes up to 488, so the tens digit in that case can only go up to 8 (since 488 is the maximum).\n\nSo, let's break it down:\n\nFor hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: each can have tens digits from 0-9, so for each of these hundreds, the tens digit cycles through 0-9, and for each, the digit 4 and 8 can appear in the tens place.\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 100-199. Tens digits can be 0-9, so 4 appears once in the tens place (140-149), which is 10 numbers. Similarly, 8 appears once in the tens place (180-189), which is another 10 numbers. So, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2: 200-299. Same logic: 4 appears 10 times (240-249), 8 appears 10 times (280-289).\n\n- Hundreds digit 3: 300-399. Similarly, 4 appears 10 times (340-349), 8 appears 10 times (380-389).\n\nNow, for hundreds digit 4: 400-488. Here, the tens digit can be 0-8 because 488 is the maximum. So, the tens digit can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, for digit 4 in the tens place: when the tens digit is 4, the numbers are 440-449. But wait, 449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nFor digit 8 in the tens place: when the tens digit is 8, the numbers would be 480-488. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here.\n\nSo, summarizing the tens place:\n\n- Hundreds digits 1,2,3: 4 appears 10 each, so 3*10=30; same for 8: 3*10=30.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total for tens place: 4 appears 30 + 10 = 40 times; 8 appears 30 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, we'll have to consider each hundreds group and the last partial group (400-488).\n\nFor hundreds digits 1,2,3: each can have units digits from 0-9, so in each hundreds group, the digit 4 appears once in the units place per ten numbers, and same for 8.\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 100-199. For units digit 4: 104,114,...,194: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, units digit 8: 108,118,...,198: 10 numbers.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2: 200-299. Similarly, 204,214,...,294: 10 times for 4; 208,218,...,298: 10 times for 8.\n\n- Hundreds digit 3: 300-399. 304,314,...,394: 10 times for 4; 308,318,...,398: 10 times for 8.\n\nNow, for hundreds digit 4: 400-488. Here, units digits go from 0-9, but we have to consider up to 488. So, for units digit 4: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, but 494 would be beyond 488. So, 9 times for 4 in the units place.\n\nFor units digit 8: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's also 9 numbers because 488 is included. So, 9 times for 8 in the units place.\n\nSo, summarizing units place:\n\n- Hundreds digits 1,2,3: 4 appears 10 each, so 3*10=30; same for 8: 3*10=30.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: 4 appears 9 times, 8 appears 9 times.\n\nTotal for units place: 4 appears 30 + 9 = 39 times; 8 appears 30 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences of 4 and 8 across all digit places.\n\nStarting with 4:\n\n- One-digit: 1 (page 4)\n- Two-digit: 19 (as calculated earlier)\n- Three-digit: hundreds place 89, tens place 40, units place 39. So, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nNow for 8:\n\n- One-digit: 1 (page 8)\n- Two-digit: 19 (as calculated earlier)\n- Three-digit: hundreds place 0, tens place 39, units place 39. So, 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems off because 188 - 98 = 90, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me recalculate the three-digit counts for 4 and 8.\n\nFor 4 in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 times (from 400-488)\n- Tens place: 40 times (30 from hundreds 1,2,3 and 10 from 400-488)\n- Units place: 39 times (30 from hundreds 1,2,3 and 9 from 400-488)\nTotal: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nFor 8 in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0\n- Tens place: 30 (from hundreds 1,2,3) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39\n- Units place: 30 (from hundreds 1,2,3) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39\nTotal: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nAdding the one-digit and two-digit counts:\n\n- 4's: 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188\n- 8's: 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check again, maybe I made a mistake in the three-digit counts.\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, for the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, which is correct because from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers.\n\nIn the tens place for three-digit numbers:\n\n- For hundreds 1,2,3: each contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place, so 3*10=30 each.\n\n- For hundreds 4: tens digit can be 0-8, so when the tens digit is 4, it's 10 numbers (440-449), and when it's 8, it's 9 numbers (480-488). So, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place: 30 + 10 = 40 for 4; 30 + 9 = 39 for 8.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- For hundreds 1,2,3: each contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the units place, so 3*10=30 each.\n\n- For hundreds 4: units digit 4 appears in 404,414,...,484, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, making it 9 times). Similarly, units digit 8 appears in 408,418,...,488, which is also 9 numbers.\n\nSo, units place: 30 + 9 = 39 for 4; 30 + 9 = 39 for 8.\n\nSo, total for three-digit numbers:\n\n4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\n8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n\nAdding one-digit and two-digit:\n\n4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the two-digit counts. Let me check that again.\n\nIn two-digit numbers (10-99):\n\n- For 4's: tens place 10 (40-49), units place 9 (14,24,...,94) = 19\n- For 8's: tens place 10 (80-89), units place 9 (18,28,...,98) = 19\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nOne-digit numbers:\n\n- 4 appears once (page 4)\n- 8 appears once (page 8)\n\nSo, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, 8's: 98, difference is 90.\n\nWait, but the problem is about a 488-page book, so pages go up to 488, which is a three-digit number, so my calculations should be correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when counting the units place in three-digit numbers for 4 and 8, I considered 30 from hundreds 1,2,3, and 9 from 400-488, making 39 each. That seems right.\n\nSimilarly, tens place for 4: 30 from 1,2,3 and 10 from 400-488, total 40. For 8, 30 from 1,2,3 and 9 from 400-488, total 39.\n\nSo, yes, 4's total to 168 in three-digit, and 8's to 78.\n\nAdding the one-digit and two-digit, which are both 1 and 19 respectively, so 188 vs 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 90. Therefore, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with one-digit numbers: these are from 1 to 9. So, pages 1 through 9. In this range, the digits that appear are 1 to 9. So, for the digit 4, how many times does it appear here? Just once, on page 4. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once on page 8. So, in the one-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear once each. So, the count for 4's is 1 and for 8's is 1 here.\n\nNext, moving on to two-digit numbers: these are from 10 to 99. Now, each two-digit number has a tens place and a units place. I think I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in both places.\n\nStarting with the tens place: For 4 in the tens place, the numbers are 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, for 8 in the tens place, the numbers are 80 to 89, which is another 10 numbers, so 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the units place: In the units place, 4 can appear in any two-digit number where the units digit is 4. So, from 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, but wait, from 10 to 99, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let me count: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 times. Similarly, for 8 in the units place, it's 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's also 9 times.\n\nWait, but wait, when the number is 44, both the tens and units digits are 4, so does that count as two 4's? Yes, because each digit is counted separately. So, in the units place, 4 appears 9 times, and in the tens place, 10 times, so total for two-digit numbers, 4's are 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times. Similarly, for 8's, it's 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because when I count the units place, from 10 to 99, each digit 0-9 appears exactly 9 times in the units place. Wait, no, actually, from 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers, so each digit from 0-9 appears 9 times in the units place, right? Because for each ten's digit (1-9), the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, 9 times for each digit in the units place. So, 4 appears 9 times in the units place and 10 times in the tens place, making 19. Similarly, 8 appears 9 times in the units place and 10 times in the tens place, also 19. So, in two-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear 19 times each.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought in the units place, 4 appears 9 times, but in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, so total 19. Same for 8. So, moving on, now I have to consider three-digit numbers, which in this case are from 100 to 488, since the book has 488 pages.\n\nSo, three-digit numbers can be broken down into hundreds, tens, and units places. I think I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each of these places.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, for hundreds digit 1: numbers from 100 to 199. For hundreds digit 2: 200-299. Similarly, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nLet's start with the hundreds place. How many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? It's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 times for 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place in three-digit numbers. So, for each hundred, the tens digit can be 0-9, and the units digit can be 0-9. But since the book ends at 488, the last hundred (400-488) will have some restrictions in the tens and units places.\n\nLet me break this down:\n\nFirst, hundreds digit 1: 100-199. The tens digit can be 0-9, and units 0-9. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9, so for each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 140-149). Similarly, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (180-189).\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds digits 2, 3, and 4, the same applies except for the last hundred (400-488), where the tens digit can go up to 8 because 488 is the last page.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: the tens digit can be 0-9, so 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for each of these hundreds, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times as well.\n\nBut for the hundreds digit 4 (400-488), the tens digit can be 0-8 because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, 4 appears when the tens digit is 4, which is from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place here.\n\nSimilarly, 8 in the tens place would be from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 9 numbers: 480-488. So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the hundreds digit 4 group.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. For hundreds digit 4, the tens digit can be 0-8 because 488 is the maximum. So, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, meaning 9 possible tens digits. So, when the tens digit is 4, that's 10 numbers (440-449). When the tens digit is 8, that's from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place for hundreds digit 4, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, now, let's sum up the tens place across all hundreds:\n\nFor hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: each has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place, so 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30 times.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4: 10 times for 4, 9 times for 8.\n\nSo, total for the tens place: 4 appears 30 + 10 = 40 times, and 8 appears 30 (from 1,2,3) + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, no. Wait, no, because for hundreds digits 1,2,3, each contributes 10 times for both 4 and 8 in the tens place. So, for 4, it's 3\u00d710=30, and for 8, it's also 3\u00d710=30. Then, for hundreds digit 4, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times. So, total for tens place: 4 appears 30 + 10 = 40 times, and 8 appears 30 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. Let's again break it down by hundreds.\n\nFor hundreds digits 1,2,3: Each hundred has 100 numbers, from 100-199, etc. In each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each tens digit. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the units place 10 times (e.g., 104,114,...,194). Similarly, 8 appears 10 times (108,118,...,198).\n\nSince there are three such hundreds (1,2,3), that's 3\u00d710=30 times for 4 and 3\u00d710=30 times for 8.\n\nNow, for hundreds digit 4 (400-488), the units digit cycles 0-9 for each tens digit, but the tens digits go up to 8. So, for each tens digit (0-8), the units digit can be 0-9, so for each tens digit, 4 appears once in the units place, and 8 appears once.\n\nSo, how many tens digits are there? From 0 to 8, that's 9 tens digits. So, for each, 4 appears once in the units place, so 9 times. Similarly, 8 appears once in each tens digit, so 9 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: For example, when the tens digit is 0, the numbers are 400-409, so 404 has a 4 in the units place. Similarly, 408 has an 8. When the tens digit is 1, 410-419, so 414 and 418. And so on up to tens digit 8, which is 480-488. So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place, except perhaps for the last one, 480-488, where the units digit only goes up to 8. Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, so for tens digit 8, the units digits go from 0 to 8, so 484 would be included, and 488 would have an 8 in the units place. So, yes, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, 4 appears once in the units place, and 8 appears once.\n\nTherefore, in hundreds digit 4, 4 appears 9 times in the units place, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total for units place:\n\nFor hundreds digits 1,2,3: 30 times for 4, 30 times for 8.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4: 9 times for 4, 9 times for 8.\n\nSo, total units place: 30 + 9 = 39 times for 4, and 30 + 9 = 39 times for 8.\n\nWait, that seems odd. Let me check again. For hundreds digits 1,2,3, each has 10 times 4 and 10 times 8 in the units place, so 3\u00d710=30 each. Then, for hundreds digit 4, it's 9 times each, so total 39 for both 4 and 8 in units place.\n\nWait, but that would mean that in the units place, 4 appears 39 times and 8 appears 39 times. Hmm, that seems correct because in each hundreds group, except the last one, they both appear 10 times, and in the last group, they both appear 9 times.\n\nSo, now, let's sum up all occurrences of 4 and 8 in three-digit numbers.\n\nFor the hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nFor the tens place: 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\nFor the units place: 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\nSo, total for three-digit numbers:\n\n4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 89 + 40 = 129; 129 + 39 = 168 times.\n\n8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 0 + 39 = 39; 39 + 39 = 78 times.\n\nNow, let's add up all the digits from one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nFrom one-digit numbers:\n\n4: 1\n\n8: 1\n\nFrom two-digit numbers:\n\n4: 19\n\n8: 19\n\nFrom three-digit numbers:\n\n4: 168\n\n8: 78\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 1 + 19 is 20, and 20 + 168 is 188 for 4's. For 8's, 1 + 19 is 20, and 20 + 78 is 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a significant difference.\n\nWait, in three-digit numbers, I had 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168. 8's: 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78. That seems correct.\n\nIn two-digit numbers, 19 each. One-digit numbers, 1 each. So, total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188. 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98. Difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the units place in three-digit numbers. For hundreds digits 1,2,3, each has 10 units digits of 4 and 10 of 8, so 3\u00d710=30 each. For hundreds digit 4, it's 9 each. So, 30 + 9 = 39 each. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, for hundreds digits 1,2,3: 10 each, so 30 each. For hundreds digit 4, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 9 times. So, 30 + 10 = 40 for 4, 30 + 9 = 39 for 8.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 168 = 188.\n\n8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 78 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, but let me check if I counted correctly in the three-digit numbers, especially the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place for hundreds digit 4: 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times. 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times. Correct.\n\nUnits place for hundreds digit 4: For each tens digit from 0 to 8, 4 appears once in the units place, so 9 times. Same for 8. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the total seems to be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. In the three-digit numbers, when I counted the hundreds place, I included 400-488, which is correct, but when I counted the tens and units places for hundreds digits 1,2,3, I included all numbers up to 399, which is correct because the book goes up to 488, so 1-999 would be up to 999, but in this case, it's only up to 488, so I think I accounted for that correctly.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the three-digit numbers, the hundreds digits go up to 4, but the tens and units digits are only up to certain points when the hundreds digit is 4. So, I think my calculations are correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n1. **One-digit page numbers (1-9):**\n   - 4 appears once (page 4).\n   - 8 appears once (page 8).\n\n2. **Two-digit page numbers (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears 9 times (14, 24, ..., 94), 8 appears 9 times (18, 28, ..., 98).\n   - Total for two-digit numbers: 4 appears 19 times, 8 appears 19 times.\n\n3. **Three-digit page numbers (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 appears 0 times.\n   - **Tens place:** \n     - Hundreds 1, 2, 3: 4 appears 10 times each, total 30; 8 appears 10 times each, total 30.\n     - Hundreds 4: 4 appears 10 times (440-449), 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n     - Total: 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n   - **Units place:** \n     - Hundreds 1, 2, 3: 4 appears 10 times each, total 30; 8 appears 10 times each, total 30.\n     - Hundreds 4: 4 appears 9 times, 8 appears 9 times.\n     - Total: 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n   - **Total for three-digit numbers:** 4 appears 168 times, 8 appears 78 times.\n\n4. **Summing up all occurrences:**\n   - 4's: 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n   - 8's: 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by categorizing the page numbers based on the number of digits. So, pages 1 through 9 are single-digit, pages 10 through 99 are two-digit, and pages 100 through 488 are three-digit numbers. I can handle each category separately to count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: pages 1 to 9. In this range, the digits that appear are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So, each digit from 1 to 9 appears exactly once. That means there's one '4' and one '8' in this range. So, the count for single-digit pages is 1 '4' and 1 '8'.\n\nNext, moving on to two-digit page numbers: pages 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I need to count how many times '4' and '8' appear in each position.\n\nFirst, let's consider the tens place. The tens digit can be from 1 to 9, and for each tens digit, the units digit ranges from 0 to 9. So, for the tens place, how many times does '4' appear? Well, when the tens digit is 4, the page numbers are 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so '4' appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, for '8', when the tens digit is 8, the page numbers are 80 to 89, which is another 10 numbers, so '8' appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers. The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each tens digit. So, for each tens digit (1 through 9), the digit '4' appears once in the units place. That's 9 times (for tens digits 1 to 9). Similarly, '8' appears once in the units place for each tens digit, so that's also 9 times.\n\nWait, but hold on. For two-digit numbers, the tens digit starts at 1, so from 10 to 99, there are 9 tens digits (1-9). Therefore, '4' in the units place occurs 9 times, and '8' in the units place occurs 9 times.\n\nAdding up the two-digit numbers: in the tens place, '4' appears 10 times, and '8' appears 10 times. In the units place, '4' appears 9 times, and '8' appears 9 times. So, total for two-digit numbers: '4's are 10 + 9 = 19, and '8's are 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nWait, that seems odd because I was expecting maybe a different count, but let me check again. For the tens place, when the tens digit is 4, it's 10 numbers (40-49), so 10 '4's. Similarly, when the tens digit is 8, it's 10 '8's. For the units place, each tens group (10-19, 20-29, etc.) has one '4' and one '8' in the units place. Since there are 9 tens groups (1-9), that's 9 '4's and 9 '8's. So, yes, 10+9=19 for both '4's and '8's in two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: pages 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because each page number has three digits: hundreds, tens, and units. I need to consider each position separately and count the occurrences of '4' and '8'.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book has 488 pages. So, the hundreds digits range from 1 to 4.\n\nFor '4's in the hundreds place: when the hundreds digit is 4, the page numbers range from 400 to 488. But wait, 488 is the last page, so it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, '4' appears in the hundreds place 89 times.\n\nFor '8's in the hundreds place: the hundreds digit can't be 8 because the book only goes up to 488. So, '8' doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 '8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be from 0 to 9, and the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But I need to be careful because when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can only go up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). Hmm, this might complicate things a bit.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to split the three-digit numbers into two parts: 100-399 and 400-488. That way, I can handle the tens and units digits uniformly in each part.\n\nStarting with 100-399: hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3. So, for each hundreds digit (1, 2, 3), the tens and units digits can be from 00 to 99. So, each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) has 100 numbers.\n\nIn each of these groups, how many times does '4' appear in the tens place? For each hundreds group, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9, so '4' appears once in the tens place for each hundred. Since there are three hundreds groups (1, 2, 3), that's 3 times for '4' in the tens place. Similarly, '8' appears once in the tens place for each hundreds group, so that's 3 times for '8' in the tens place.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. For each hundreds group, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9, and for each cycle, '4' appears once in the tens place. So, for each hundreds group, '4' appears 10 times in the tens place (since for each hundreds digit, the tens digit cycles through 0-9, and '4' is one of them). Wait, no, actually, for each hundreds group, the tens digit is fixed for each page. So, for example, in 100-199, the tens digit is 0 for 100-109, 1 for 110-119, etc., up to 9 for 190-199. So, in each hundreds group, '4' appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 140-149). So, that's 10 times per hundreds group. Since there are three hundreds groups (1, 2, 3), that's 3 * 10 = 30 '4's in the tens place. Similarly, '8' appears 10 times per hundreds group, so 3 * 10 = 30 '8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me clarify: for each hundreds group (100-199, etc.), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9, and for each tens digit, there are 10 numbers (units digits 0-9). So, for each hundreds group, '4' appears in the tens place exactly 10 times (e.g., 140-149). Similarly, '8' appears 10 times in the tens place. Since there are three hundreds groups (1, 2, 3), that's 3 * 10 = 30 '4's and 30 '8's in the tens place across 100-399.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in 100-399. For each hundreds group, each tens digit group (0-9) has 10 numbers, and in each of those, the units digit cycles from 0-9. So, for each hundreds group, '4' appears once in the units place for each tens group. Since there are 10 tens groups per hundreds group, that's 10 '4's per hundreds group. With three hundreds groups, that's 3 * 10 = 30 '4's in the units place. Similarly, '8' appears once in the units place for each tens group, so 3 * 10 = 30 '8's in the units place.\n\nSo, for 100-399, the total '4's are 30 (tens) + 30 (units) = 60, and '8's are 30 (tens) + 30 (units) = 60.\n\nNow, let's move to the three-digit numbers from 400-488. Here, the hundreds digit is 4, so we need to be careful with the tens and units digits because the last page is 488.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: as I thought earlier, '4' appears 89 times (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, that's 89 '4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, the tens place in 400-488. The tens digit can be from 0 to 8 because 488 is the last page. So, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409), 1 (410-419), ..., up to 8 (480-488). Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the tens digit 8 only goes up to 488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Hmm, so the tens digits in 400-488 are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, but for tens digit 8, the units digit can only go up to 8, not 9. So, how does this affect the count?\n\nLet me break it down:\n\nFor tens digits 0-7: each of these has 10 numbers (units 0-9). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 7, there are 10 numbers. So, for each of these, how many '4's and '8's are in the tens place? Well, the tens digit is fixed, so '4' appears in the tens place when the tens digit is 4, and '8' appears when the tens digit is 8.\n\nWait, but in this case, the tens digits are 0-8, but for tens digits 0-7, each has 10 numbers. So, for the tens digit 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so '4' appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, for the tens digit 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so '8' appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, no. Wait, when the hundreds digit is 4, and the tens digit is 4, the page numbers are 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so '4' appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, when the tens digit is 8, the page numbers are 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so '8' appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nBut wait, I'm trying to count how many times '4' and '8' appear in the tens place. So, for '4's in the tens place, it's 10 times (440-449). For '8's in the tens place, it's 9 times (480-488). So, in the tens place for 400-488, '4' appears 10 times and '8' appears 9 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in 400-488. Here, for each tens group (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488), the units digit cycles from 0-9, except for the last group (480-488), where it only goes up to 8.\n\nSo, for tens digits 0-7, each has 10 numbers, so the units digit cycles through 0-9, meaning '4' and '8' each appear once per tens group. So, for each of these 8 tens groups (0-7), '4' appears once in the units place, totaling 8 '4's. Similarly, '8' appears once in each of these 8 tens groups, totaling 8 '8's.\n\nNow, for the tens digit 8 (480-488), the units digits go from 0-8, so '4' appears once (484) and '8' appears once (488). So, that's 1 '4' and 1 '8' in the units place for this group.\n\nAdding these up: for the units place in 400-488, '4's are 8 (from tens 0-7) + 1 (from tens 8) = 9 '4's. Similarly, '8's are 8 (from tens 0-7) + 1 (from tens 8) = 9 '8's.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. For each tens group from 400-409 up to 470-479, each has 10 numbers, so '4' appears once in the units place for each, that's 8 times (tens 0-7). Then, for 480-488, which has 9 numbers, '4' appears once (484) and '8' appears once (488). So, total '4's in units place: 8 + 1 = 9, and '8's: 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nSo, in the units place for 400-488, '4' appears 9 times and '8' appears 9 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: '4' appears 89 times, '8' appears 0 times.\n- Tens place: '4' appears 10 times, '8' appears 9 times.\n- Units place: '4' appears 9 times, '8' appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total for three-digit numbers:\n'4's: 89 (hundreds) + 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 108\n'8's: 0 (hundreds) + 9 (tens) + 9 (units) = 18\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake in the tens and units place counts for three-digit numbers. Let me go back.\n\nEarlier, I split the three-digit numbers into 100-399 and 400-488.\n\nFor 100-399:\n- Hundreds place: '4' and '8' don't appear because hundreds digits are 1,2,3.\n- Tens place: '4' appears 30 times (3 hundreds groups * 10 each), '8' appears 30 times.\n- Units place: '4' appears 30 times, '8' appears 30 times.\nTotal for 100-399: '4's = 60, '8's = 60.\n\nFor 400-488:\n- Hundreds place: '4' appears 89 times, '8' appears 0 times.\n- Tens place: '4' appears 10 times (440-449), '8' appears 9 times (480-488).\n- Units place: '4' appears 9 times, '8' appears 9 times.\n\nSo, adding up for 400-488:\n'4's: 89 (hundreds) + 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 108\n'8's: 0 (hundreds) + 9 (tens) + 9 (units) = 18\n\nSo, total '4's in three-digit numbers: 60 (from 100-399) + 108 (from 400-488) = 168\nTotal '8's in three-digit numbers: 60 (from 100-399) + 18 (from 400-488) = 78\n\nWait, that can't be right because 100-399 contributes 60 '4's and 60 '8's, and 400-488 contributes 108 '4's and 18 '8's. So, total '4's: 60 + 108 = 168, and '8's: 60 + 18 = 78.\n\nBut let me check the three-digit numbers again because I might have made a mistake in the 400-488 section.\n\nWait, in 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so '4' appears 89 times there. Then, in the tens place, '4' appears in 440-449 (10 times) and '8' appears in 480-488 (9 times). In the units place, '4' appears 9 times and '8' appears 9 times.\n\nSo, for 400-488, '4's: 89 + 10 + 9 = 108\n'8's: 0 + 9 + 9 = 18\n\nAdding to 100-399, which has 60 '4's and 60 '8's, total '4's: 60 + 108 = 168\nTotal '8's: 60 + 18 = 78\n\nNow, let's add up all the page numbers:\n\nSingle-digit (1-9):\n'4's: 1\n'8's: 1\n\nTwo-digit (10-99):\n'4's: 19\n'8's: 19\n\nThree-digit (100-488):\n'4's: 168\n'8's: 78\n\nTotal '4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\nTotal '8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nWait, so the total number of '4's is 188, and '8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check because I might have made a mistake in the three-digit counts.\n\nWait, let me go back to the three-digit numbers:\n\n100-399:\n- Tens place: '4' appears 30 times, '8' appears 30 times.\n- Units place: '4' appears 30 times, '8' appears 30 times.\nTotal: 60 '4's and 60 '8's.\n\n400-488:\n- Hundreds place: '4' appears 89 times.\n- Tens place: '4' appears 10 times, '8' appears 9 times.\n- Units place: '4' appears 9 times, '8' appears 9 times.\nTotal: 89 + 10 + 9 = 108 '4's, and 0 + 9 + 9 = 18 '8's.\n\nSo, total '4's in three-digit: 60 + 108 = 168\nTotal '8's in three-digit: 60 + 18 = 78\n\nAdding single and two-digit:\nSingle: '4's=1, '8's=1\nTwo-digit: '4's=19, '8's=19\nThree-digit: '4's=168, '8's=78\n\nTotal '4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\nTotal '8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because when I think about the three-digit numbers, especially 400-488, I might have overcounted. Let me verify the counts again.\n\nIn 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so every page number here starts with 4, so '4' appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place, '4' appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 '4's.\n\nIn the units place, '4' appears once in each tens group except the last one, which only goes up to 488. So, for tens groups 400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479, each has 10 numbers, so '4' appears once in each, that's 8 times. Then, in 480-488, '4' appears once (484). So, total '4's in units place: 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nSimilarly, '8's in the tens place: only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so '8' appears once in the tens place.\n\nIn the units place, '8' appears once in each tens group from 400-409 up to 470-479, that's 8 times, and once in 480-488 (488), so 9 times.\n\nSo, '8's in 400-488: tens place 9, units place 9, total 18.\n\nAdding to the 100-399 counts, which are 60 '4's and 60 '8's, we get:\n\nTotal '4's: 60 + 89 (hundreds) + 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 60 + 89 + 10 + 9 = 168\nTotal '8's: 60 + 9 (tens) + 9 (units) = 60 + 9 + 9 = 78\n\nAdding single and two-digit counts:\n\n'4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n'8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit concerned because 90 seems like a lot. Let me check another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the number of '4's and '8's separately.\n\nLet me try calculating the number of '4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\nTwo-digit: in tens place, '4' appears 10 times (40-49), and in units place, '4' appears 9 times (14,24,...,94), so 10 + 9 = 19\nThree-digit:\n\n100-399:\n- Hundreds place: 0 '4's\n- Tens place: 3 hundreds groups, each has 10 '4's in tens place, so 3*10=30\n- Units place: 3 hundreds groups, each has 10 '4's in units place, so 3*10=30\nTotal for 100-399: 0 + 30 + 30 = 60\n\n400-488:\n- Hundreds place: 89 '4's\n- Tens place: 10 '4's (440-449)\n- Units place: 9 '4's (as calculated earlier)\nTotal for 400-488: 89 + 10 + 9 = 108\n\nTotal '4's: 1 + 19 + 60 + 108 = 188\n\nSimilarly, for '8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\nTwo-digit: in tens place, '8' appears 10 times (80-89), and in units place, '8' appears 9 times (18,28,...,98), so 10 + 9 = 19\nThree-digit:\n\n100-399:\n- Hundreds place: 0 '8's\n- Tens place: 3 hundreds groups, each has 10 '8's in tens place, so 3*10=30\n- Units place: 3 hundreds groups, each has 10 '8's in units place, so 3*10=30\nTotal for 100-399: 0 + 30 + 30 = 60\n\n400-488:\n- Hundreds place: 0 '8's\n- Tens place: 9 '8's (480-488)\n- Units place: 9 '8's (as calculated earlier)\nTotal for 400-488: 0 + 9 + 9 = 18\n\nTotal '8's: 1 + 19 + 60 + 18 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the three-digit counts for '8's. Let me check again.\n\nIn 400-488, the tens place for '8's is only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so '8' appears once in the tens place for each of those 9 numbers? Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 for all those numbers, so '8' appears 9 times in the tens place because the units digits go from 0 to 8, making 9 numbers. So, that's correct: 9 '8's in the tens place.\n\nIn the units place, for each tens group from 400-409 up to 470-479, '8' appears once in the units place, so 8 times. Then, in 480-488, '8' appears once (488). So, total '8's in units place: 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nSo, total '8's in 400-488: 9 (tens) + 9 (units) = 18.\n\nAdding up: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 60 (100-399) + 18 (400-488) = 98.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the difference is indeed 90.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough times, so I'm confident that the answer is 90 more '4's than '8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of '4's printed is 188, and the number of '8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by understanding the range of page numbers. The book has 488 pages, so the page numbers go from 1 to 488. That means the first few pages are single-digit numbers (1-9), then two-digit numbers (10-99), and finally three-digit numbers (100-488). \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nMaybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That way, I can systematically count the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each place.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, every 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). \n\nIn each group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears once. So, for 48 complete groups, that's 48 times 4's and 48 times 8's. But wait, in the units place, from 1 to 480, each digit appears 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). \n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 48 (from the complete groups) + 1 (from 484) = 49. \n\nTotal 8's in units place: 48 (from the complete groups) + 1 (from 488) = 49. \n\nHmm, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. That means the difference from the units place is zero. Interesting.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. So, for example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), etc., up to 9 (90-99). Each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred.\n\nSince the book has 488 pages, let's see how many hundreds we have. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages beyond that (401-488). \n\nIn each full hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349). Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389). \n\nSo, for each hundred, that's 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. Since there are 4 full hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 4's and 40 8's.\n\nNow, let's look at the partial hundred from 401 to 488. The tens digit here ranges from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490. But since we only go up to 488, the last group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers.\n\nSo, in the tens place for 401-488, the digit 4 appears in the tens place only once, from 440-449. Wait, no, 440-449 would be in the hundreds place, but in the tens place, 440-449 would have 4 in the hundreds and tens place. Wait, no, I'm confused.\n\nWait, no, the tens digit is the second digit from the right. So, for 401-488, the tens digit can be 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-490). But since we only go up to 488, the last group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 481-488.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place in 401-488? Let's see, 440-449 would have 4 in the tens place, but wait, 440-449 is in the 400s, so the hundreds digit is 4, but the tens digit is 4 for those numbers. So, that's 10 numbers: 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times. \n\nSimilarly, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, no, 480 is part of the 401-488 range, right? So, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in this partial hundred.\n\nWait, but let me check. From 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). \n\nSo, in the partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 9 times. \n\nTherefore, total 4's in the tens place: 4 full hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 10 in the partial hundred, so 50.\n\nTotal 8's in the tens place: 4 full hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 9 in the partial hundred, so 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times, so the difference is 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is the first digit from the left. In this case, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. \n\nFor the hundreds digit, each digit from 1 to 4 appears a certain number of times. \n\n- For hundreds digit 1: pages 100-199, which is 100 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 1 for 100 times.\n- Similarly, for 2: pages 200-299, 100 times.\n- For 3: pages 300-399, 100 times.\n- For 4: pages 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\nNow, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Only in pages 400-488, which is 89 times. \n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 8 in the hundreds place would be pages 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's in the hundreds place: 89.\n\nTotal 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times more than 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- From 1-480: 48 groups of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 each.\n- From 481-488: units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n- So, total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n- Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\nThat seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Full hundreds (1-400): 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 each.\n- Partial hundred (401-488): 440-449 gives 10 4's in tens place, and 480-488 gives 9 8's in tens place.\n- So, total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n- Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\nThat also seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 400-488: 89 pages, so 89 4's in hundreds place.\n- 800-899: not present, so 0 8's.\nSo, 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's in hundreds place.\n\nAdding up:\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place from 1-480.\n   - From 481-488, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times per hundred. For 4 full hundreds (1-400), 4 appears 40 times and 8 appears 40 times.\n   - From 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 appears 0 times as the book doesn't reach 800.\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"
