    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 all the way up to 488. \n\nI guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll handle each place for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:** The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So in every block of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. To find out how many times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 4. That's 48 times. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is actually 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks and then an extra 8 numbers (481-488). In those extra numbers, the units digit 4 appears once (484). So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For each block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, from 1 to 488, how many full hundreds are there? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8. The digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 times.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, in every block of 10, 8 appears once. So 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8. Plus the extra 8 numbers (481-488), where 488 has an 8 in the units place. So units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit cycles every 100. In each block of 100, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are 4 full hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8. The digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times (since 480-488 is 9 numbers). So total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So the hundreds digit 8 doesn't appear at all. So 0 times.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 times.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full, plus 1 in the extra 8, total 49. Correct.\n- Tens: 4 full hundreds, 10 each, so 40. Then in 401-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so 9 times. Wait, earlier I thought it was 10, but actually from 480-489 would be 10, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9. Wait, no, wait. From 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers (480, 481,...,488). So the tens place 8's in 401-488 is 9, making total tens 40 + 9 = 49. But for 4's in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So 4's tens place is 50, 8's tens place is 49.\n\nFor 4's hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times. Correct.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n- Tens: 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n- Hundreds: 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nSo 188 - 98 = 90. So there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the logic now.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is 188, while the digit 8 appears 98 times. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI think the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have those totals, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for the digit 8. For example, in 1-10, 4 appears in 4 and 8 appears in 8. This pattern repeats every 10 numbers.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). In each complete block, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 times 1, which is 48, and the same for 8's. But wait, I also need to check those extra 8 numbers. From 481 to 488, the units digits are 1 through 8. So, in this partial block, does 4 appear? Yes, at 484, and 8 appears at 488. So, that's one more 4 and one more 8. Therefore, the total for the units place is 48 + 1 = 49 for 4's and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8's. Hmm, so in the units place, they're equal.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, up to 9 for 90-99. So, in each block of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (40-49), and similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (80-89). \n\nSince the book has 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 extra pages (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4 times 10, which is 40 for 4's and 40 for 8's. Now, the partial block from 401-488. The tens digit here goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, in the tens place, does 4 appear? Yes, in 440-449, but wait, 440 is beyond 488? No, 440 is within 401-488, right? Wait, no, 440 is 440, which is less than 488. So, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 for 4's in the tens place. What about 8's? The tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that's 9 for 8's in the tens place. \n\nWait, let me check that again. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, for the tens digit being 4, it's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. For the tens digit being 8, it's from 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, in the partial block, 4's in the tens place add 10, and 8's add 9.\n\nSo, total for the tens place: 4's are 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 = 50, and 8's are 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 = 49. So, in the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 49. So, 4's are one more here.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no. Wait, page 1 is 1, which is a single digit, but in terms of hundreds place, it's 0. Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify. Let me think.\n\nActually, for the hundreds place, it's non-zero only when the page number is 100 or above. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0. From 100-199, it's 1. From 200-299, it's 2. From 300-399, it's 3. From 400-488, it's 4. \n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive). So, 89 times. How about 8's in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have 8's in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8's in the hundreds place are 0.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times, and 8's appear 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the totals for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place:\n- Complete blocks: 48 blocks, each contributing 1 for 4 and 8. So, 48 each.\n- Partial block: 481-488, units digits 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units total: 48 +1 =49 for both.\n\nTens place:\n- Complete blocks: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 for 4's and 10 for 8's. So, 40 each.\n- Partial block (401-488): 4's in tens place from 440-449, which is 10. 8's in tens place from 480-488, which is 9. So, tens total: 40 +10=50 for 4's, 40 +9=49 for 8's.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n- 8's: 0 times.\n\nAdding up:\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 all the way up to 488.\n\nI guess the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) separately and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by analyzing the units place. For the units digit, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 10, the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then a partial block of 8 numbers (481 to 488). In each full block, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So for the units place, the number of 4's is 48, and the number of 8's is also 48. But wait, in the partial block from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So in this partial block, the units digit 4 appears once (484), and the digit 8 appears once (488). So that adds one more 4 and one more 8. So in total, for the units place, 4's are 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. So the count for units place is equal for both digits.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit changes every 10 numbers. So, for example, from 1-9, the tens digit is 0, then 10-19 have tens digit 1, 20-29 have tens digit 2, and so on. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears in the tens place for exactly 10 numbers each. So, to find how many times 4 appears in the tens place, I can think of each block of 100 pages. Wait, maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nLet me think: The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, in the range 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit is 8 for 80-89, which is another 10 times. So in each 100-page block, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, how many full 100-page blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block from 401-488.\n\nIn each full block, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers and 8 for another 10 numbers. So for 4 blocks, that's 4*10 = 40 times for 4 and 4*10 = 40 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, in the partial block from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). Wait, no, actually, 401-410 would have a tens digit of 0, 411-420 would have a tens digit of 1, and so on up to 480-488, which has a tens digit of 8. So in this partial block, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? It would be from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, no, actually, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. Hmm, but wait, 480 is included, so from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers. So in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n\nWait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, right? So that's correct. So in the partial block, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 9 times. So adding that to the full blocks, the total for the tens place would be 40 (from full blocks) + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 (from full blocks) + 9 = 49 for 8.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. The partial block is from 401-488. So the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So in the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So yes, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times in the tens place of the partial block.\n\nSo total for tens place: 4's = 40 + 10 = 50, 8's = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). So the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and 8 does not appear in the hundreds place at all because the highest page is 488, so the hundreds digit is 4, not 8. So 8's count in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo now, let's sum up the counts for each digit across all places.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's, so we subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nFirst, units place: Each 10 numbers have one 4 and one 8. 488 divided by 10 is 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4's and 8's in units place. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each 100 numbers have 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So 400 pages would have 4*10=40 for 4's and same for 8's. Then, the partial block from 401-488: 440-449 is 10 4's, and 480-488 is 9 8's. So 40 +10=50 for 4's and 40 +9=49 for 8's. That looks correct.\n\nHundreds place: Only 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times. 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488. So 89 4's and 0 8's here. Correct.\n\nAdding up: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188 for 4's. For 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 98. So 188 -98=90. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? It's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So yes, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nAnother way to check: Maybe I can calculate the total number of digits and see if it makes sense, but that might be overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe I can recount the tens place in the partial block.\n\nIn the partial block from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the end. So yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the number of times 8 appears in the tens place as 48 times, but no, because each 100 pages have 10 8's in the tens place, and there are 4 full hundreds, so 4*10=40, plus in the partial hundred, 480-488 gives 9 more, so 40+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, it's 4 full hundreds giving 40, plus 10 in the partial block, totaling 50.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's total 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's total 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I considered all the positions correctly. Did I miss any digit positions? No, I considered units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nAnother way to approach this might be to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position separately and then sum them up, which is what I did.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each 10 pages contain one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n- 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 full sets, each contributing one 4 and one 8.\n- The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n- Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n- Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each 100 pages contain 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n- 4 full hundreds (1-400) contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 each.\n- In the partial hundred (401-488), 440-449 adds 10 4's, and 480-488 adds 9 8's.\n- Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n- Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- Only pages 400-488 have a hundreds digit of 4, totaling 89 times.\n- 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n- Total 4's: 89.\n- Total 8's: 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nFirst, the units place. In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1 to 10, it's 4; from 11 to 20, it's 14; and so on. So, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets and a partial set of 8 numbers. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times. But wait, in the last partial set (481 to 488), does the digit 4 appear in the units place? Let's see: 484 is within that range, so that's one more. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers every hundred. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all ten numbers. So, how many times does this happen in 488 pages? Well, every hundred pages, this happens once. So, from 1-100, 40-49 is one set, 140-149 is another, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? So that's five sets. Each set contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? Well, from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers, contributing 89 more 4's.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, in every set of ten numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, how many complete sets of ten are in 488? 48 complete sets, as before, with a partial set of 8 numbers. So, 48 times in the units place. In the last partial set (481-488), does 8 appear in the units place? Yes, 488 is within that range, so that's one more. So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers every hundred. So, from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488, which is only 9 numbers, not 10. So, how many complete sets do we have? Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers\n\nSo, that's four complete sets of 10 and one partial set of 9. Each complete set contributes 10 occurrences, so 4\u00d710=40. The partial set contributes 9 occurrences. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor the 4's:\n- Units: 48 sets \u00d71 +1 =49\n- Tens: 5 sets \u00d710=50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49+50+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's:\n- Units:48 sets \u00d71 +1=49\n- Tens:4 sets \u00d710=40 +9=49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98. Correct.\n\nDifference:188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** In every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 occurrences. The last 8 numbers (481-488) include another 4 (484), totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred (e.g., 40-49). There are 5 such sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), contributing 5\u00d710=50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in all numbers from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. With 48 complete sets and one in 488, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in sets like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are four complete sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 4\u00d710=40, and the last set (480-488) contributes 9, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No numbers in 488 have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488.\n\nI guess I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense.\n\nLet me start by considering the different positions where a digit can appear: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll need to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each of these positions separately and then add them up.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in a sequence of numbers. But since we're starting from 1, the first page is 1, so the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. Wait, actually, starting from 1, the units digits go 1,2,3,...,9,0,1,2,... So in each block of 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in the units place, except that the first block (1-10) has 0 only at page 10.\n\nBut wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of complete groups of 10 and then handle any remaining pages. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra pages (481 to 488).\n\nIn each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the digit 8 appears once as well (8, 18, 28, etc.). So for the units place, in each group of 10, both 4 and 8 appear once.\n\nSince there are 48 complete groups, the number of 4's in the units place is 48, and the same for 8's. Now, we have 8 extra pages: 481 to 488. Let's check the units digits here: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So the digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). So adding these, the total for units place is 48 + 1 = 49 for 4's and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8's. Wait, that's interesting, they're equal in the units place.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. Wait, each group of 10 has exactly one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So 48 groups would give 48 each. Then the last 8 pages: 481-488, which are 8 numbers. The units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So in these, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So total units digits: 48 +1 =49 for 4's and 48 +1=49 for 8's. So they are equal in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit in the tens place appears 10 times in each block of 100. So for each digit, in the tens place, it appears 10 times per 100 numbers.\n\nSo for the digit 4 in the tens place: It appears in the numbers 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but since our book only goes up to 488, the last block would be 440-449, and then 450-488. So how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nFrom 40-49: that's 10 numbers, so 10 times.\nFrom 140-149: another 10.\nFrom 240-249: another 10.\nFrom 340-349: another 10.\nFrom 440-449: another 10.\nSo that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50 times.\n\nWait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So total 50 times for 4 in the tens place.\n\nNow for the digit 8 in the tens place: It appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so the last block would be 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So let's see:\n\nFrom 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 times.\nFrom 180-189: 10 times.\nFrom 280-289: 10 times.\nFrom 380-389: 10 times.\nFrom 480-488: 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 9 times.\n\nSo total for 8 in the tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49 times.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So 4 appears 50 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 49 times. So in the tens place, 4's are more by 1.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each position.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n- Each group of 10 has one 4 and one 8.\n- 488 pages mean 48 full groups of 10 (480 pages) plus 8 extra pages (481-488).\n- So units digits: 48*1=48 for each digit, plus in the last 8 pages, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So total 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- For 4: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50.\n- For 8: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So 4 blocks of 10 and one of 9, totaling 49. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times.\n- 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488. So 0. Correct.\n\nAdding up:\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 =98\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me check: from 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: the hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 90. So there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total complete groups of 10: 48 (480 pages).\n   - Each digit appears 48 times in the units place.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488): 4 appears once (484), 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total: 4's = 48 + 1 = 49; 8's = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449: 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n   - Total: 4's = 50; 8's = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears from 400-488: 89 times.\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 4's = 89; 8's = 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 all the way up to 488. \n\nI guess the first thing I should do is figure out how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each position and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles through 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. For example, from 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So 4 appears once at 4, and 8 appears once at 8.\n\nNow, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each complete set, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So for 48 sets, that's 48 fours and 48 eights in the units place.\n\nNow, looking at the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So in this partial set, the units digit 4 appears once at 484, and the digit 8 appears once at 488. So that adds 1 more four and 1 more eight in the units place.\n\nSo total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 fours and 48 + 1 = 49 eights. Wait, that seems like the same number, but let me check again. From 1-480, there are 48 sets of 10, so 48 fours and 48 eights. Then 481-488: units digits 1-8, so 484 has a 4, and 488 has an 8. So yes, that's 1 more four and 1 more eight. So units place: 49 fours and 49 eights. Hmm, so so far, they are equal in the units place.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So each digit appears 10 times in the tens place per hundred.\n\nSo, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, we can think of the tens digit as having four complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488.\n\nIn each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49 in the first hundred, 140-149 in the second, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n\nSo, for the first 400 pages, which is four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 4 times 10 = 40 times, and the same for 8, 40 times.\n\nNow, let's look at the remaining pages from 401-488. The tens digit here goes from 0 to 8. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place in this range.\n\nFrom 401-409: tens digit is 0, so no 4 or 8 here.\nFrom 410-419: tens digit is 1, so no.\n420-429: tens digit is 2, no.\n430-439: tens digit is 3, no.\n440-449: tens digit is 4, so that's 10 numbers where 4 appears in the tens place.\n450-459: tens digit is 5, no.\n460-469: tens digit is 6, no.\n470-479: tens digit is 7, no.\n480-488: tens digit is 8, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but 488 is the last page, so from 480-488, that's 9 pages. So in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here.\n\nWait, but wait, in the tens place, each hundred has 10 occurrences for each digit. But in this case, from 401-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, but only goes up to 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place from 480-488.\n\nSo, in the tens place from 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). \n\nSo, total tens place counts:\n- 4: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (440-449) = 50\n- 8: 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (480-488) = 49\n\nWait, that seems correct. So in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. \n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. \n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, hundreds place counts:\n- 4: 89\n- 8: 0\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in all positions.\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal fours = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal eights = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 49 + 49 is 98, and adding 0 gives 98. So, total fours are 188 and eights are 98. \n\nWait, but that would mean there are 188 - 98 = 90 more fours than eights. Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big difference.\n\nWait, let me go through each digit place again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many fours in units place?\n\nEach 10 numbers have one 4. So 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens and 8 extra numbers.\n\nIn each full ten, one 4, so 48 * 1 = 48 fours.\n\nIn the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8. So 4 appears once at 484. So total units fours: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSame for units eights: 48 in the full tens, and one at 488, so 48 + 1 = 49. So that's correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nFrom 1-400, each hundred has 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So four hundreds: 4 * 10 = 40 fours, 4 * 10 = 40 eights.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8.\n\nLooking for fours in the tens place: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours.\n\nLooking for eights in the tens place: 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights.\n\nSo total tens fours: 40 + 10 = 50\n\nTotal tens eights: 40 + 9 = 49\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 400-488, hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nEights in hundreds place: none, since the book only goes up to 488, so 0.\n\nSo total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check if I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, correct? Because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nAnd eights in hundreds place: since the book is 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so 0 eights there.\n\nSo, 188 fours and 98 eights. The difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is that correct? Because 488 is a relatively small number, so having 90 more fours seems a lot. Maybe I made a mistake in the tens place.\n\nWait, in the tens place, from 401-488, the fours in the tens place are from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. That's correct.\n\nEights in the tens place are from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So that's correct.\n\nWait, so 50 fours in tens place and 49 eights, which adds up correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of another way. Maybe using a formula or a different approach to confirm.\n\nAnother approach could be to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor a number with n digits, the count of a digit d in the k-th position can be calculated using a formula, but since 488 is a three-digit number, maybe it's easier to break it down as I did before.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about how many times each digit appears in each position up to 488.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the counts again.\n\nLet me recalculate the units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEach 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 484 has a 4 in the units place. So total units fours: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, units eights: same calculation, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nFrom 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So 4 hundreds: 40 fours and 40 eights.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8. So:\n\n- For fours in the tens place: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours.\n- For eights in the tens place: 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights.\n\nSo total tens fours: 40 + 10 = 50\n\nTotal tens eights: 40 + 9 = 49\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-399, hundreds digit is 1,2,3, so no fours or eights in the hundreds place.\n\nFrom 400-488, hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nEights in hundreds place: none, since the book ends at 488.\n\nSo total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nTotal eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Is there a possibility that I double-counted or missed something?\n\nWait, for the units place, I think it's correct because each 10 numbers contribute one 4 and one 8, and the remaining 8 numbers contribute one 4 and one 8.\n\nIn the tens place, from 401-488, the fours in the tens place are 10 numbers, which is correct because 440-449 is 10 numbers. The eights in the tens place are 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. No eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours, and 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 eights. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is 188, while the digit 8 appears 98 times. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI guess I should separate the problem into looking at each digit place individually: units, tens, and hundreds. That way, I can calculate how many times each digit (4 and 8) appears in each place and then compare the totals.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. Therefore, the digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers, and so does the digit 8. \n\nNow, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups and a partial group of 8 numbers (481 to 488). In each complete group, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for 48 groups, that's 48 times each. Then, in the partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so both 4 and 8 appear once. \n\nWait, let me check that. The last group is from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers. So the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So yes, 4 appears once and 8 appears once in the units place of the partial group. So, total for units place: 48 + 1 = 49 times for 4, and the same for 8.\n\nNow moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digits go from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, in each set of 100, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 40-49. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers: 80-89.\n\nNow, how many complete sets of 100 are there in 488? That's 4 complete sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial set from 401-488. \n\nIn each complete set, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so 4 times 10 is 40. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times each set, so 4 sets give 40 times for 8 as well. Now, the partial set from 401-488: the tens digit here goes from 0 (for 401-409) up to 8 (for 480-488). So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 and 8 appear?\n\nWait, 401-488: the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for the tens digit 4, it occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 times. Similarly, for 8 in the tens place, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, because 488 is the last page. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the partial set.\n\nWait, let me make sure. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit 4 occurs when the tens place is 4, which is 440-449, which is 10 numbers. The tens digit 8 occurs when the tens place is 8, which is 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, in the partial set, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nTherefore, total for the tens place: 4's are 40 (from complete sets) + 10 (partial) = 50 times. 8's are 40 (from complete sets) + 9 (partial) = 49 times.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Each complete set (1-100, etc.) has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place, so 4 sets give 40 for each. Then, in the partial set (401-488), the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (440-449) and 8 occurs 9 times (480-488). So, yes, 50 for 4's and 49 for 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit changes every 100 numbers. From 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0 (but since we're starting from 1, maybe it's not printed? Wait, but in reality, page numbers don't have leading zeros, so from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist; it's just the tens and units digits. So, the hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. How about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo, summarizing the hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's add up all the occurrences for each digit.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 488 pages. For units digits, each digit 0-9 appears floor(488/10) = 48 times, and then the remainder is 8, so digits 1-8 appear once more. So, 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8 in units place. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each complete hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. 4 complete hundreds (1-400) give 40 each. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, for 4 in tens place, 440-449 is 10 numbers. For 8, 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's. That adds up correctly.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times. 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place. So, 89 for 4's, 0 for 8's.\n\nAdding up: 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me check again. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place, correct. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit only goes up to 4. So, 0 for 8's in hundreds place.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place in the partial set. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit, it's 10 numbers except when we reach the end. So, for tens digit 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. For tens digit 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that part is correct.\n\nAnother way to check: Let's calculate the total number of digits printed. Each page from 1-9 has 1 digit, 10-99 have 2 digits, 100-488 have 3 digits.\n\nNumber of pages with 1 digit: 9 (1-9)\nNumber of pages with 2 digits: 90 (10-99)\nNumber of pages with 3 digits: 488 - 99 = 389 (100-488)\n\nTotal digits:\n1-digit: 9 pages * 1 digit = 9\n2-digit: 90 pages * 2 digits = 180\n3-digit: 389 pages * 3 digits = 1167\nTotal digits = 9 + 180 + 1167 = 1356 digits.\n\nNow, total number of 4's and 8's should be less than or equal to 1356, but let's see if our counts make sense.\n\nTotal 4's: 188\nTotal 8's: 98\nTotal digits accounted for by 4's and 8's: 188 + 98 = 286, which is much less than 1356, so that seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the total number of times each digit appears in each place and see if it adds up.\n\nUnits place: For 1-488, each digit 0-9 appears floor(488/10) = 48 times, and the remainder is 8, so digits 1-8 appear once more. So, units digits: each digit appears 48 + 1 = 49 times for digits 1-8, and 48 times for 0. So, 49 times each for 1-8, which matches our earlier count.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 complete hundreds (1-400) give 40 times each. Then, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except for 8, which appears 9 times because we stop at 488. Wait, no, actually, in the tens place from 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0 (401-409), 1 (410-419), ..., up to 8 (480-488). Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears exactly 10 times except for 8, which appears 9 times because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times, but the other digits 0-7 appear 10 times each in the tens place from 401-488.\n\nWait, that would mean that in the partial set, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (as in 440-449), and 8 appears 9 times. So, total for tens place: 40 (from complete sets) + 10 (for 4) + 9 (for 8) = 59 for 4 and 49 for 8. Wait, that doesn't make sense because earlier I thought it was 50 for 4 and 49 for 8.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me approach it differently. From 1-400, each digit in the tens place appears 40 times (4 sets of 10 times each). Then, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except for 8, which appears 9 times because 488 is the last page.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-409) up to 8 (480-488). Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears exactly 10 times except for 8, which appears 9 times because the last number is 488, not 489. So, in the tens place from 401-488:\n\n- Tens digit 0: 401-409 (9 numbers) \u2192 Wait, no, 401-409 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 0, so that's 9 numbers. But wait, 401 is 4 0 1, so the tens digit is 0. But 401-409 is 9 numbers, so tens digit 0 appears 9 times, not 10.\n\nWait, this is where I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me think carefully. From 401-488, how many times does each tens digit appear?\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- Tens digit 0: 401-409 \u2192 9 numbers (401,402,...,409)\n- Tens digit 1: 410-419 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 2: 420-429 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 3: 430-439 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 4: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 5: 450-459 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 6: 460-469 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 7: 470-479 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 8: 480-488 \u2192 9 numbers (480,481,...,488)\n\nSo, in the partial set from 401-488, the tens digits:\n\n- 0: 9\n- 1: 10\n- 2: 10\n- 3: 10\n- 4: 10\n- 5: 10\n- 6: 10\n- 7: 10\n- 8: 9\n\nTherefore, for the tens place in the partial set:\n\n- 4 appears 10 times\n- 8 appears 9 times\n\nSo, total in tens place:\n\n- 4's: 40 (from complete sets) + 10 = 50\n- 8's: 40 (from complete sets) + 9 = 49\n\nWhich matches my earlier calculation. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just do a quick sanity check. If I were to count all the 4's and 8's in each place, the hundreds place contributes a significant number of 4's, which would make the total 4's higher than 8's. So, 90 more 4's than 8's seems plausible.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI guess the first step is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll go through each position and count the occurrences of 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, every 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). \n\nIn each complete set of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), so that's 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so the digit 4 doesn't appear here. So, total 4's in units place: 48.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, each set of 10 has one 8 (like 8, 18, 28, etc.), so that's also 48 times. In the extra 8 numbers, 488 is the last page, so the units digit is 8 here. So that's one more 8. So total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait a second, 488 is page 488, so in the units place, 488 would have an 8, right? So yes, that's correct, adding one more 8. So units place: 4's = 48, 8's = 49.\n\nNow moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So, for example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. But since we start at 1, maybe it's slightly different, but I think the logic still holds.\n\nSo, the total number of hundreds is 4 (since 488 is less than 500, so we have 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, actually, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, let's see.\n\nFor the tens place, each hundred block (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has each digit from 0-9 appearing 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 = 40 times for each digit in the tens place.\n\nBut wait, the last hundred block is 400-488, which is only 88 numbers, not 100. So, in the tens place for 400-488, how many times does each digit appear? Let's see.\n\nFrom 400-409: tens digit is 0\n410-419: tens digit is 1\n420-429: tens digit is 2\n430-439: tens digit is 3\n440-449: tens digit is 4\n450-459: tens digit is 5\n460-469: tens digit is 6\n470-479: tens digit is 7\n480-488: tens digit is 8\n\nWait, so in 400-488, how many times does each tens digit appear? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each tens digit from 0-8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which is 8, appearing 9 times because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive).\n\nWait, let me check: 400-409 is 10 numbers, so tens digit 0 appears 10 times. Similarly, 410-419 is another 10, so 1 appears 10 times, and so on up to 470-479, which is 10 numbers. Then 480-488 is 9 numbers, so tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, for the tens digit in the 400-488 block, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, overall, for the tens place, how many 4's and 8's are there?\n\nFrom 1-399, each hundred block (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) has each digit in the tens place appearing 10 times. So, 4 blocks, each contributing 10 times for each digit. So, 4 * 10 = 40 times for each digit in the tens place.\n\nBut wait, in the 400-488 block, for the tens digit, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total for the tens place:\n\n4's: 40 (from 1-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 50\n8's: 40 (from 1-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 49\n\nWait, that seems correct? Because in each of the first four hundreds, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then in the last partial hundred, 400-488, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49\n\nWait, but wait, 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so does that affect the count for the first three hundreds? I think not because each hundred before 400 is complete, so 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399 are all complete hundreds, each contributing 10 times each digit in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only present in page numbers from 100 onwards. So, let's see.\n\nFrom 1-99, there's no hundreds digit, so 0 occurrences.\n\nFrom 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so 100 times.\n\nFrom 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, 100 times.\n\nFrom 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, 100 times.\n\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, 89 times (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, how many 4's and 8's are there?\n\nLooking for 4's: only in 400-488, which is 89 times.\n\nLooking for 8's: in the hundreds place, 8 would only appear if the hundreds digit was 8, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89\nTotal 8's in hundreds place: 0\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences for 4's and 8's across units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nFirst, total 4's:\n\nUnits place: 48\nTens place: 50\nHundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate:\n\n48 + 50 = 98\n98 + 89 = 187\n\nSo, total 4's: 187\n\nNow, total 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49\nTens place: 49\nHundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, 49 + 49 is 98, correct.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many 4's in units place? Every 10 numbers, once, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 times, and since 488 is the last page, the units digit doesn't add another 4. So, 48 4's in units place.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so that's one more 8, making it 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nFrom 1-399, each hundred contributes 10 times each digit in the tens place, so 4 hundreds (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each contributing 10, so 4*10=40 for each digit.\n\nIn 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly 400-488 has the hundreds digit as 4, which is 89 times. 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 89 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **4's:** Occur once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times.\n   - **8's:** Occur once every 10 numbers, plus one more in 488, totaling 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - **4's:** Each hundred block contributes 10, plus 10 in 440-449, totaling 50.\n   - **8's:** Each hundred block contributes 10, plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **4's:** Occur 89 times in 400-488.\n   - **8's:** Do not occur.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187  \nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98  \nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, pages 1-9 are single-digit, 10-99 are two-digit, and 100-488 are three-digit numbers.\n\nI think the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers and do the same for the digit 8. Then, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the digit 4. Let's consider each position separately.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every set of ten numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. Since there are 488 pages, how many complete sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So that's 48 fours. But wait, the last partial set is from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers. So in the units place, does 484 have a 4? Yes, so that's one more 4. So total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of ten numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes ten 4's in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: 40-49 is one, 140-149 is another, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks. Each block has ten 4's, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 fours.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, in every set of ten numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of ten are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. But wait, in the last partial set, 481-488, the units digit 8 appears in 488. So that's one more 8. So total units place 8's would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks contributes ten 8's in the tens place. How many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's count: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four blocks. So 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800 to 899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89 eights in total.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 89 = 99.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. For 8's: units 49, tens 40, so 89 total. 188 - 89 is indeed 99. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the units place for 4's, I considered 488 as 48 sets of ten plus a partial set of 8 numbers, but actually, 488 is the last page, so the units digit 4's should be in pages 4, 14, ..., 484. Let me check how many times 4 appears in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? It's the same as the number of times 4 appears in the units place, which is every 10 numbers. So 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4, and then in the last partial decade, 481-488, the units digit 4 is at 484, so that's one more, making 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, same logic: 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, and in the last partial decade, 488 has an 8, so 49 eights in the units place.\n\nFor the tens place, 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing ten 4's, so 50. That's correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four blocks, each contributing ten 8's, so 40. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4's from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. 8's in hundreds place: none, since 488 < 800. So that's 0.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Total 8's: 49 + 40 + 0 = 89. Difference is 188 - 89 = 99.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the problem says \"how many more 4's are printed than 8's,\" so 99 more 4's. That seems correct based on the calculations.\n\nI think I've covered all the positions and counted correctly. So the answer should be 99.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 4.  \n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 480, contributing 48 fours.  \n   - The last 8 numbers (481-488) include 484, adding one more 4.  \n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49 fours.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - Every block of 100 numbers has a 40-49 block, contributing 10 fours.  \n   - There are five such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).  \n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - Pages 400-488 each have a 4 in the hundreds place.  \n   - Total: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 fours.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 8.  \n   - 48 complete sets of 10 contribute 48 eights.  \n   - The last 8 numbers (481-488) include 488, adding one more 8.  \n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - Every block of 100 numbers has an 80-89 block, contributing 10 eights.  \n   - There are four such blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389).  \n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - There are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place (since 488 < 800).  \n   - Total: 0 eights.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 89 eights.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (total 4's) - 89 (total 8's) = 99.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 99.\n\n$\\boxed{99}$"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488.\n\nI guess I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the different positions where digits can appear: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll handle each position separately for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. Units place: In every set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, it's 4; from 11-20, it's 14, and so on. So, how many such sets are there up to 488?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. Each full set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more in 484. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1-480, that's 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48. Then from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So yes, 49 total.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, the digit 4 in the tens place occurs in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, from 140-149, and 240-249, etc.\n\nHow many such blocks are there up to 488?\n\nWell, each hundred contributes one such block. So, 1-100: 40-49 (10 numbers)\n101-200: 140-149 (10)\n201-300: 240-249 (10)\n301-400: 340-349 (10)\n401-488: 440-449 (10, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10.\n\nWait, but 488 is less than 500, so 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So that's 5 blocks in total, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So 5 x 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So 5 blocks, each with 10 4's in the tens place, so 50.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The digit 4 in the hundreds place occurs from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but let me check if I did that correctly.\n\nWait, 49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99, plus 89 (hundreds) = 188. Hmm, but wait, maybe I'm overcounting. Because in the hundreds place, from 400-488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the digit 8:\n\nSimilarly, I'll count the number of 8's in units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. Units place: Same as for 4, in every set of 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, how many full sets of 10 are there up to 488?\n\n488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8, so 488 is the only one with an 8 in the units place. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so that's correct.\n\n2. Tens place: The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488.\n\nEach of these blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except maybe the last one if it's cut short.\n\nLet's count the blocks:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488)\n\nWait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in 480-488.\n\nSo total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, so 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So yes, 4*10 +9=49.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would occur from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, so the total number of 4's is 188 and the total number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because 90 seems like a big difference.\n\nWait, when I calculated the 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49 +49=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89, correct.\n\nFor 8's, the hundreds place is 0, correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 4's again. I thought there were 5 blocks of 10 where the tens digit is 4: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each contributes 10 4's, so 5*10=50. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, I had 5 blocks, but the last one only had 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nWait, but 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, yes, 49.\n\nUnits place: Both 4 and 8 have 49 each, which makes sense because in each set of 10, they each appear once, and the last partial set also includes one more for each.\n\nSo, yes, 4's:188, 8's:98, difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because I remember sometimes when counting digits, you have to be careful about overlapping or something, but I think in this case, each digit position is independent, so adding them up should be fine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. Let me try to count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position again.\n\nFor units place:\n\n- 4's: from 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The first term is 4, last term is 484. The common difference is 10. So, number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49.\n\nSame for 8's: from 8,18,28,...,488. Last term is 488. So, ((488 -8)/10)+1=(480/10)+1=48+1=49.\n\nFor tens place:\n\n4's: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449.\n\nEach block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 10 each: 50.\n\n8's: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488.\n\nWait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, so 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's: 400-488: 89 numbers.\n\n8's: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, 4's total:49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's total:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just check if I made any mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 -400 +1=89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, I think I did that correctly as well.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the difference is 90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Occurs once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n     - Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49 times.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - Occurs in blocks of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n     - Each block contributes 10 '4's.

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488.\n\nI remember that to find how many times a specific digit appears, I can analyze each digit position separately\u2014units, tens, and hundreds. So, I should check how many times the digit 4 appears in each position and do the same for 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and an extra 8 numbers. In each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So, total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, each group of 10 has one 8 (like 8, 18, 28, etc.), so that's also 48 times. In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit includes 8 (488), so that's one more. So, total 8's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me think again. When I have 488 pages, the last page is 488, so the units digit goes up to 8 in that last partial group. So, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 8 appears once here. Therefore, the total 8's in the units place are 48 (from the complete groups) plus 1 (from the last partial group), totaling 49. So, 4's in units place: 48, 8's:49.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. For the tens digit, the digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each group of 100 has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, from 1 to 488, how many hundreds do we have? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nIn each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit being 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Therefore, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nFor the digit 8 in the tens place, each hundred has 10 occurrences (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, in the first four hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. In the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's 9 times. Therefore, total 8's in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, no, let me check that again. From 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 480-489, but since we stop at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, but the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them. So, that's 89 times. Wait, but page numbers start at 1, so the hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 times.\n\nNow, let me sum up the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check each part.\n\nUnits place:\n- 4's: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 times, as each group of 10 has one 4. Correct.\n- 8's: Similarly, 48 full groups, each with one 8, so 48, plus the last 8 numbers (481-488) include 488, so one more 8, total 49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n- 4's: Each hundred has 10, so 4 hundreds give 40, plus in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10, so 40 + 10 = 50. Correct.\n- 8's: Each hundred has 10, so 40, plus in 401-488, tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9, so 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 times. Correct.\n- 8's: 0, since 488 < 800. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because the hundreds place contributes a lot. Let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the hundreds digit being 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 4's there.\n\nSo, the calculation seems correct. Therefore, the number of 4's exceeds the number of 8's by 89.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488.\n\nI guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position and then add them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 appears once. For example, in 1-10, we have 4 and 8; in 11-20, we have 14 and 18, and so on.\n\nNow, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). So, in each full block, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Therefore, for the units digit, the number of 4's is 48 and the number of 8's is also 48.\n\nWait, but I have that partial block of 8 numbers. Let me check if any of those have a 4 or 8 in the units place. The last block is 481-488. The units digits here are 1 through 8. So, in this partial block, the units digit 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, adding those, the units place contributes 49 4's and 49 8's. Wait, no, that's not right. Because the full blocks already included up to 480, and the last 8 pages are 481-488. So, in the units place, 484 is the 4 and 488 is the 8. So, actually, the units place has 48 (from the full blocks) plus 1 for 484, making 49 4's, and 48 (from the full blocks) plus 1 for 488, making 49 8's. So, units place contributes 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the last block is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, the units digits in that block are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). Therefore, the units digit 4's are 48 (from the first 480 pages) plus 1, totaling 49. Similarly, units digit 8's are 48 plus 1, totaling 49. So, units place contributes equally to both 4's and 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 times, and 8 in 80-89, also 10 times. So, in each block of 100, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\nSince the book has 488 pages, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and an additional 88 pages (401-488). So, for each of the 4 hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4*10=40 4's, and similarly, 4*10=40 8's.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. The tens digit in 401-488 is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, ..., up to 8 for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 appears from 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, but wait, 401-488 is only up to 488, so 440-449 is within that range. So, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times in 440-449, and the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in 481-488.\n\nWait, but 481-488 is only 8 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 8 times, not 10. So, in the tens place for 401-488, 4's appear 10 times (440-449) and 8's appear 8 times (481-488). Therefore, the total tens digit 4's are 40 (from the first 400 pages) plus 10, totaling 50. The tens digit 8's are 40 plus 8, totaling 48.\n\nWait, but wait, in the first 400 pages, each hundred block contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40 for 4's and 4*10=40 for 8's. Then, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 from 480 to 489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. Wait, no, 480 is page 480, which is included, so from 480-488, that's 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's 9 times. Wait, but 480 is part of 481-488? No, 480 is page 480, which is within 401-488. Wait, 480 is page 480, which is in the 401-488 range. So, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 times. Therefore, in the tens place, 4's are 10 times (440-449) and 8's are 9 times (480-488).\n\nTherefore, total tens digit 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nTotal tens digit 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9 times for 8's in the tens place. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. From 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. So, yes, 10 and 9.\n\nSo, total tens digit 4's: 40 +10=50.\n\nTotal tens digit 8's: 40 +9=49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488.\n\nWait, no, the hundreds digit is 1 for 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the hundreds digit 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, hundreds digit 4's: 89.\n\nHundreds digit 8's: 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the digits.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49.\n\n- Tens place: 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49.\n\n- Tens place: 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 +49 +0=98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 49 4's and 49 8's. In the tens place, 50 4's and 49 8's. In the hundreds place, 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188 for 4's.\n\n49+49+0=98 for 8's.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But let me verify the counts again.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Every 10 pages, so 488/10=48.8, so 48 full tens and 8 extra pages. In each full ten, 4 appears once, so 48 times. In the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484). So, total units 4's: 48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, units 8's: 48 times in the full tens, plus once in the last 8 pages (488), so 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nIn the tens digit, each hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) contribute 4*10=40 each.\n\nThen, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens 4's: 40+10=50.\n\nTotal tens 8's: 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\n8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 full blocks (480 pages) and a partial block of 8 pages (481-488).\n   - Units digit 4's: 48 (from full blocks) + 1 (484) = 49.\n   - Units digit 8's: 48 (from full blocks) + 1 (488) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 pages contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - There are 4 full hundreds (400 pages), contributing 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - In the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Tens digit 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Tens digit 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, contributing 89 4's.\n   - The hundreds digit 8 never appears.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI guess the first step is to figure out how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each place and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, every 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, 4 appears once in the units place every 10 numbers, and similarly, 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n\nNow, how many sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, I think we take the integer part, which is 48 full sets. Each of these sets contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, that's 48 times for 4 and 48 times for 8 in the units place.\n\nBut wait, there's a remainder when we divide 488 by 10. The remainder is 8, right? Because 48*10 is 480, and 488-480 is 8. So, after 480, we have pages 481 to 488. In these, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once more (page 484) and 8 appears once more (page 488). So, adding that, the units place has 48+1=49 times for 4 and 48+1=49 times for 8. Wait, but that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so the units digits go up to 8, so 4 appears once more, and 8 appears once more.\n\nWait, but actually, from 1 to 488, the number of times the units digit is 4 is 49 times because 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so the last set from 481-488 includes 484, which is the 49th occurrence. Similarly, 8 appears 49 times in the units place because 488 is included.\n\nWait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me think again. The number of times a digit appears in the units place can be calculated as the number of complete decades (sets of 10) plus one if the digit is less than or equal to the remainder. So, for digit d, the count is (n // 10) + (1 if d <= (n % 10) else 0). So, for 4, it's 48 + (1 if 4 <=8 else 0) = 49. Similarly for 8, it's 48 + (1 if 8 <=8 else 0) = 49. So, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place.\n\nWait, but that seems odd because 488 is the last page, so the units digit goes up to 8. So, from 1 to 488, the units digits cycle 48 times through 0-9, and then an extra 1-8. So, 4 appears once in each cycle, so 48 times plus once more in the partial cycle, making 49. Same for 8, which appears once per cycle plus once in the partial cycle, making 49. So, yes, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because when n is 488, the units digit goes up to 8, so for 4, it's 48 times plus one more at 484, which is 49. For 8, it's 48 times plus one more at 488, so 49. So, both 4 and 8 have 49 occurrences in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0-9 ten times each. Wait, no, actually, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place for every 100 numbers.\n\nSo, for the tens place, the number of times a digit appears is (n // 100) * 10 plus some adjustment for the remaining pages beyond the last complete hundred.\n\nSo, for 488 pages, the number of complete hundreds is 4 (since 4*100=400), and the remaining pages are 88.\n\nSo, for the tens digit, each digit from 0-9 appears 4*10=40 times in the tens place from 1-400. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear?\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-488). Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 481-488 is 8 pages, so the tens digit 8 appears 8 times? Wait, no, each tens digit in the range 401-500 would be from 0 to 9, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digits go up to 8, and each digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times in their respective ranges. Wait, no, because from 401-488, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears exactly 10 times except perhaps the last one.\n\nWait, let me think again. From 401-410, the tens digit is 0, which is 10 pages. From 411-420, tens digit 1, 10 pages. Similarly, up to 481-490, tens digit 8, which would be 10 pages (481-490). But since we only go up to 488, the last set is 481-488, which is 8 pages, so the tens digit 8 appears only 8 times in this last partial hundred.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except the last one, which appears 8 times. So, for the tens digit 4, in the 400s, it's 410-419, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. Similarly, for 8, it's 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 pages (480-488). Wait, no, 480-489 is 10 pages, but we only have up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the 400s.\n\nWait, but actually, 480 is page 480, 481, ..., up to 488, which is 9 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the 400s. So, for the tens place, the count for each digit is:\n\n- For digits 0-7: 4*10 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-480) = 50 times each.\n- For digit 8: 4*10 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49 times.\n- For digit 9: It doesn't appear in the tens place because we only go up to 488.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right because from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for each digit from 0 to 8, how many times do they appear in the tens place in 401-488?\n\nFrom 401-410: tens digit 0, 10 times.\n411-420: 1, 10 times.\n...\n471-480: 7, 10 times.\n481-488: 8, 8 times.\n\nSo, for digits 0-7, they each appear 10 times in the 400s, and digit 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, total for each digit in the tens place:\n\n- 0: 4*10 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-410) = 50\n- 1: 4*10 + 10 = 50\n- ...\n- 7: 4*10 +10 = 50\n- 8: 4*10 +8 = 48\n- 9: 4*10 +0 = 40 (since 9 doesn't appear in the tens place beyond 490, which is beyond 488)\n\nWait, but that contradicts earlier. Let me double-check. From 1-400, each tens digit from 0-9 appears 40 times because 400/100=4, so 4 times each 10 numbers. Then, from 401-488, which is 88 pages, the tens digits go from 0-8, each appearing 10 times except the last one, which appears 8 times.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because from 401-488, the tens digits are 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., 8 (481-488). So, each tens digit from 0-8 appears 10 times except for 8, which appears 8 times. So, the count for each digit in the tens place is:\n\n- 0: 40 (from 1-400) +10 =50\n- 1:40 +10=50\n- ...\n- 7:40 +10=50\n- 8:40 +8=48\n- 9:40 +0=40\n\nSo, in the tens place, digit 4 appears 50 times, and digit 8 appears 48 times.\n\nWait, but wait, digit 4 in the tens place: from 1-400, it's 40 times (40-49, 140-149, etc.), and from 401-488, the tens digit 4 is from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. So, total 40+10=50 times. Similarly, for 8 in the tens place, from 1-400, it's 40 times (80-89, 180-189, etc.), and from 401-488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. So, 40+9=49 times. Wait, now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 8 times, but actually, from 480-488, that's 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the 400s.\n\nWait, let me correct that. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. So, total for digit 8 in the tens place is 40 (from 1-400) +9=49 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, digit 4 appears 50 times, and digit 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488.\n\nWait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (488-400+1=89). So, digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nDigit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4 at maximum, not 8. So, digit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences for each digit:\n\nFor digit 4:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times\n\nFor digit 8:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n- 488 pages, so for units digit, 48 full decades (1-480) and 8 extra pages (481-488).\n- So, 4 appears 48 +1=49 times in units.\n- 8 appears 48 +1=49 times in units.\n\nTens place:\n- From 1-400, each digit appears 40 times in tens place.\n- From 401-488, tens digits go 0-8, each appearing 10 times except 8, which appears 9 times (480-488).\n- So, digit 4 in tens place: 40 +10=50\n- Digit 8 in tens place: 40 +9=49\n\nHundreds place:\n- Digit 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times.\n- Digit 8 never appears in hundreds place.\n\nSo, total for 4: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188\nTotal for 8:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers is calculated by considering each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately. Similarly, the count for digit 8 is done. After summing up the occurrences in each place, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is found to be 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488.\n\nI guess I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nFirst, the units place. The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers, right? So from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 pages, like 4, 14, 24, etc. So I can calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488 and then see how many 4's are in each group.\n\nSo, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8. Since we can't have a fraction of a group, there are 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 times. But wait, I think I might be missing something. The last group might not be complete. Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so the last group is from 481 to 488. The units digit 4 would be at 484, which is within this group. So actually, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place because the first group starts at 1-10, which includes page 4, and the last group includes page 484. Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again.\n\nActually, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete tens. So from 1 to 480, there are 480 numbers, which is 48 groups of 10. Each group contributes one 4, so that's 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So that adds one more, making it 49 times in the units place.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me verify. For example, from 1-10, 4 appears once. 11-20, once, and so on up to 481-490. But since the book ends at 488, the last group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So in that group, only 484 has a 4 in the units place. So yes, 48 times from 1-480, plus one more from 481-488, totaling 49.\n\nWait, but 480 is the last multiple of 10 before 488, so 480 is included. So from 1-480, there are 48 occurrences. Then 481-488 adds one more, so 49 in total for the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for a range of 10 numbers each time. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4.\n\nSo how many such ranges are there? Let's see: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488.\n\nWait, from 0-99, the tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10. Same for 200-299, 240-249, and 300-399, 340-349. Now, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 times 10 is 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's 50 occurrences in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check again. From 1-99, the tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then in each subsequent hundred, like 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 times. So yes, 50 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but actually, the hundreds digit is only 4 for numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. So that's the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89). So 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So 4 appears 188 times in total.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers.\n\nAgain, I'll consider units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place. The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers, similar to 4. So from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nAgain, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 8. Then, in the last group, 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place. So that's one more, making it 49 times in the units place.\n\nWait, but let me think: from 1-10, 8 appears once (page 8). Then 11-20, once (page 18), and so on up to 481-490. But since we're only going up to 488, the last group is 481-488, where the units digits go from 1 to 8, so page 488 has an 8 in the units place. So that's 48 groups of 10, each contributing one 8, plus one more in the last group, totaling 49.\n\nWait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each with one 8, so 48. Then, the last partial group from 481-488 includes 488, which has an 8 in the units place, so that's 49 total.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8.\n\nNow, how many such ranges are there? From 1-99, 80-89 is one range (10 numbers). Then in 100-199, 180-189 is another 10. Similarly, 280-289 in 200-299, 380-389 in 300-399, and 480-489 in 400-488. Wait, but 480-489 is partially included because our book ends at 488. So 480-488 is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So in the tens place, how many 8's are there?\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights in the tens place.\n- 180-189: 10 eights.\n- 280-289: 10 eights.\n- 380-389: 10 eights.\n- 480-488: Here, the tens digit is 8 for numbers 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 480 is included and 488 is the last). So that's 9 eights.\n\nSo total in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Each hundred has a range where the tens digit is 8, except the last one, which is cut off at 488. So yes, 4 full hundreds with 10 each, and the last partial hundred with 9. So 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So the hundreds place contributes 0 to the count of 8's.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 49 in units, 49 in tens, so 49+49=98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's was 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the units place for 4's. Did I count correctly? From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nIt's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. So the number of such numbers is equal to the number of times 4 appears in the units place.\n\nSince 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus the last partial cycle from 481-488, which includes 484, so one more. So 49 total. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49,140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50. That seems correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So 89 times. That adds up.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 49, tens place:49, so 98 total. That seems correct.\n\nSo the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can think of another way to count. For example, for each digit position, count how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a more systematic approach.\n\nIn the units place, the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to n can be calculated as:\n\nunits = (n // 10) + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place:\n\ntens = (n // 100) * 10 + min(max(n % 100 - d*10 + 1, 0), 10)\n\nWait, maybe that's more complicated, but let me try.\n\nAlternatively, for the units digit, the count is floor((488 + 1) / 10) if d <= (488 +1) mod 10 else floor((488 +1)/10). Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to stick with my initial method.\n\nWait, another way: For each digit position, the number of times a digit appears can be calculated as follows.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: 488 // 10 = 48. Each group contributes one 4, so 48. Then, check if the last partial group (481-488) has a 4 in the units place. Since 488 mod 10 is 8, and 4 <=8, so there is one more 4, making it 49.\n\nSimilarly for 8's in units place: 488//10=48, and since 488 mod 10=8, which is >=8, so one more, total 49.\n\nFor tens digit:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in tens place:\n\nThe tens digit cycles every 100. Each cycle has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. The number of complete hundreds is 4 (since 488 is less than 500). So 4*10=40. Then, check the last partial hundred: 400-488. The tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 more. So total 40+10=50.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 5 ranges, but actually, from 0-99, 100-199, etc., up to 400-488, which is 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 50. That's consistent.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place:\n\nEach hundred has a range where the tens digit is 8, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each contributes 10. The number of complete hundreds is 4 (since 488 is less than 500). So 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred, 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So total 40+9=49.\n\nThat's consistent with my earlier count.\n\nFor the hundreds digit:\n\n4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\n8 appears in 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So 0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188\n\n8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nSo, yes, I think 90 is the correct answer. There are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now. So I'm confident the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4, totaling 48. The last partial group (481-488) includes 484, adding one more, making it 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10 occurrences. There are 5 such ranges (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\n   **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8, totaling 48. The last partial group (481-488) includes 488, adding one more, making it 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contributing 10 occurrences. There are 4 full ranges and a partial range (480-488) contributing 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n   **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - The number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 appears 90 more times than the digit 8 in the page numbers.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then an extra 8 pages. So, in each block, the units digit 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. But wait, in the last partial block from 481 to 488, does the digit 4 appear in the units place? Yes, 484 is within that range, so that's one more. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for a block of 100 numbers, specifically from 40 to 49, 140 to 149, and so on. Each such block contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Let me figure out how many full blocks of 100 there are in 488. There are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Wait, no, actually, from 1 to 400, that's 4 blocks, but 488 is beyond 400. So, from 400-488, that's another partial block. \n\nIn each full block of 100, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, 4 blocks would give 4*10 = 40. Now, in the partial block from 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, hold on, that seems off. Let me check again. From 1-400, there are 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10 tens place 4's, so 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the hundreds digit is 4 only for numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's: units place 49, tens place 50, hundreds place 89. So, total 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, for every block of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, in 488 pages, how many full blocks of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks and 8 extra pages. So, units place 8's are 48 times. Now, in the last partial block (481-488), does the digit 8 appear in the units place? Yes, 488 is included, so that's one more. So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each full block contributes 10 occurrences, and the last block is partial.\n\nFrom 1-488, the full blocks where the tens digit is 8 are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, the partial block from 480-488 has 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me verify that. From 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, right? Because 480 is 4 8 0, 481 is 4 8 1, up to 488, which is 4 8 8. So, that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, yes, 9 times. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 0 occurrences of 8.\n\nSo, adding up all the 8's: units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds place 0. So, total 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (48 full tens and 1 in the last partial set).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (4 full hundreds contributing 10 each, and 10 in the last partial hundred).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (pages 400\u2013488).\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (48 full tens and 1 in the last partial set).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (4 full hundreds contributing 10 each, and 9 in the last partial hundred).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences (no page numbers reach 800).\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488.\n\nI guess I'll start by looking at how often the digits 4 and 8 appear in each place: units, tens, and hundreds. Maybe I should handle each digit place separately.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, every 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once and the digit 8 appears once.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). In each of those 48 blocks, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So that's 48 times each for both digits.\n\nNow, looking at the extra 8 numbers: 481 to 488. The units digits here are 1 through 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, adding that to the previous count, the units place contributes 48 + 1 = 49 fours and 48 + 1 = 49 eights.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so the units digit goes up to 8, so 481 has units digit 1, 482 has 2, up to 488 with 8. So, in those 8 extra numbers, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 49 fours and 49 eights.\n\nMoving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digits go from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, in each hundred, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nIn each of those 4 hundreds, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49 in the first hundred, 140-149 in the second, etc.), and the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n\nSo, for the tens place, up to 400, we have 4 times 10, which is 40 fours and 40 eights.\n\nNow, looking at the remaining 88 pages: 401-488. The tens digits here go from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 480-488). So, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nFrom 401-410: tens digit is 0.\n411-420: tens digit is 1.\n421-430: tens digit is 2.\n431-440: tens digit is 3.\n441-450: tens digit is 4.\n451-460: tens digit is 5.\n461-470: tens digit is 6.\n471-480: tens digit is 7.\n481-488: tens digit is 8.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears once in 441-450 (10 times, but wait, 441-450 is 10 numbers, so the tens digit is 4 for all of them, so that's 10 fours. Similarly, 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for all 8 of those. But wait, from 481-488, that's 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for each, so that's 8 eights.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 times, and the tens digit 8 occurs in 481-488, which is 8 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, for the last 88 pages, we have 10 fours and 8 eights.\n\nTherefore, total fours in the tens place: 4*10 (from the complete hundreds) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50 fours.\n\nTotal eights in the tens place: 4*10 (from the complete hundreds) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48 eights.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 hundreds give 40 fours and 40 eights. Then from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 times, so adding 10 fours, making it 50 fours. For the eights, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 eights, making it 40 + 8 = 48 eights in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 pages. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit never reaches 8 because 800 is beyond 488. So, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4, but never 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor fours:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor eights:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal eights: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, earlier in the units place, I thought both fours and eights had 49 each, but let me confirm that.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48 fours. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (at 484). So, total units fours: 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, units eights: 48 times in the full tens, plus once in 488, so 49 eights. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for fours: each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 hundreds give 40 fours. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So, total fours in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. That's correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, fours appear from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor eights:\n\nUnits place: 49, as above.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 hundreds give 40 eights. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nHundreds place: 0, as the hundreds digit never reaches 8 in 488.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nNow, the question is how many more fours are printed than eights. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, 188 fours and 97 eights. The difference is 188 - 97 = 91. Hmm, maybe that's correct. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but when I add up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 188. Eights: units (49) + tens (48) + hundreds (0) = 97. So, 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me think about the tens place again. In 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. That's correct. And the tens digit 8 occurs in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 eights. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the number of fours and eights in each digit place separately and then sum them up.\n\nWait, another approach: For each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), calculate how many times 4 appears and how many times 8 appears.\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of fours: floor(488 / 10) = 48, plus if the last digit is >=4, we add 1 more if 488's units digit is >=4. 488's units digit is 8, which is >=4, so 48 + 1 = 49 fours.\n\nSimilarly, number of eights: floor(488 / 10) = 48, plus if the last digit is >=8, we add 1 more. 488's units digit is 8, so 48 + 1 = 49 eights.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of fours: floor(488 / 100) = 4, each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit cycles. The tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So, total fours in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, number of eights in tens place: floor(488 / 100) = 4, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers, the tens digit 8 occurs in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumber of fours: floor(488 / 1000) = 0, but since we're dealing with hundreds, it's actually how many times 4 appears in the hundreds digit. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nNumber of eights in hundreds place: 0, since 488 < 800.\n\nSo, total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal eights: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 91 more fours than eights.\n\nBut let me just cross-verify with another method. Maybe by counting how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula for digit counting.\n\nFor a given digit d and position (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times d appears can be calculated as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number as N = 488.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of times d appears = (N // 10) + (1 if (N % 10) >= d else 0). But this is only if d != 0.\n\nWait, actually, the formula is a bit more involved. Let me recall the standard digit counting method.\n\nThe formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is:\n\ncount_units = (N // 10) + (1 if (N % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place:\n\ncount_tens = (N // 100) * 10 + extra, where extra is:\n\nIf the tens digit is greater than d, add 10.\n\nIf the tens digit is equal to d, add (N % 10 + 1).\n\nIf the tens digit is less than d, add 0.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use a more systematic approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of each digit place separately.\n\nLet me try to calculate the number of fours and eights in each digit place.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nNumber of fours in units place:\n\nEach block of 10 numbers contributes exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the number of complete blocks in 488 is 48 (since 48*10=480). So, 48 fours. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (at 484). So, total fours in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, number of eights in units place: Each block of 10 contributes one 8. So, 48 eights from the complete blocks. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers, 8 appears once (at 488). So, total eights in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of fours in tens place:\n\nEach block of 100 numbers contributes 10 fours in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, for 488, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40 fours.\n\nNow, the remaining 88 numbers (401-488) need to be checked for fours in the tens place. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 fours. So, total fours in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, number of eights in tens place:\n\nEach block of 100 contributes 10 eights in the tens place (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, 4 blocks give 4*10=40 eights.\n\nIn the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, 8 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumber of fours in hundreds place:\n\nThe hundreds digit is 4 for numbers 400-488. The count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours.\n\nNumber of eights in hundreds place:\n\nSince 488 < 800, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 eights.\n\nNow, summing up:\n\nFours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nEights: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nSo, the answer is 91 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of fours printed is 91 more than the number of eights.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, I'll need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these numbers and how many times 8 appears, then subtract the two counts to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the different positions where digits can appear: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I think it's best to handle each digit position separately because the frequency of each digit can vary depending on the position.\n\nFirst, I'll count the number of 4's in each position.\n\nStarting with the units place: In every set of ten consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, how many such sets are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of ten and then an extra 8 numbers (481-488). In each full set, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Here, the digit 4 appears in a block of ten numbers. For example, in 40-49, every number has a 4 in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Well, each hundred has one such block. Since 488 is less than 500, we have four hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, actually, 400-488 is part of the 400s, so let me correct that. Each hundred from 0-99, 100-199, etc., up to 400-488. So, from 0-99, the tens place 4 appears in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, from 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10 numbers. Same for 200-299 (240-249) and 300-399 (340-349). Now, for 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, and since there are four full hundreds up to 400, that's 4 times 10, which is 40. Then, in 400-488, it's another 10, so total 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but hold on, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, units place gave me 49, tens place 50, and now hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers, meaning 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, no, that's correct. So, total 4's are 188.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. For the units place: 48 full tens (each contributing 1) = 48, plus 1 in 481-488, total 49. Tens place: each hundred contributes 10, so 4 hundreds would be 40, plus the 400-488, which is another 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 89. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with units place: Similar to 4's, in each set of ten numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, how many full tens are there up to 488? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: Here, 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each hundred contributes one such block of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 0-99, it's 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199, it's 180-189 (another 10). Similarly, 200-299 has 280-289, and 300-399 has 380-389. Now, 400-488: does 480-488 count? Yes, because the tens digit is 8 here. So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but in the tens place, 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many 8's in the tens place? Each of the first four hundreds contributes 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, it's 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think again. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). Then, 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but 4*10 is 40, plus 9 is 49. So, tens place 8's: 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. So, total 8's: 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, for 4's, I had 188. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts because I might have made a mistake.\n\nFirst, let's recount the 4's.\n\nUnits place: Each ten numbers, 4 appears once. From 1 to 488, how many full tens? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have 481, 482, ..., 488. The units digits here are 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more. So, units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes a block where the tens digit is 4. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers. From 0-99: 40-49 (10). 100-199: 140-149 (10). 200-299: 240-249 (10). 300-399: 340-349 (10). 400-488: 440-449 (10). So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. So, tens place 4's: 50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, 8's.\n\nUnits place: Each ten numbers, 8 appears once. So, 48 full tens, 48, plus the last 8 numbers (481-488), which includes 8 once. So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes a block where the tens digit is 8. So, 0-99: 80-89 (10). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that's 9 numbers. So, tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: As the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly for the tens place in 8's. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 8's in the tens place. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? It's the same as the number of times the tens digit is 8. So, for each hundred, it's 10 times, and in the last partial hundred (400-488), it's 9 times. So, 4 full hundreds contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, so 4*10 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, from 0-488, each hundred contributes 10, and since 488 is in the 400s, which also has a full block of 440-449, so 5 blocks in total, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nWait, but wait, 0-99 is the first hundred, then 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, that's five segments, but 400-488 is not a full hundred, but for the tens digit, the 4's in the tens place occur in 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is within 400-488. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, it's 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4 full blocks of 10 and one partial block of 9, totaling 49.\n\nSo, I think my counts are correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can check with a smaller example to see if my method works.\n\nSuppose the book has 20 pages. Let's count the number of 1's and 2's, just as a test.\n\nPage numbers: 1-20.\n\nCount of 1's:\n\nUnits place: 1,11,21 (but 21 is beyond 20, so 1 and 11, so 2 times.\n\nTens place: 10-19, which is 10 numbers, each contributing a 1 in the tens place, so 10.\n\nHundreds place: none, since 20 is less than 100.\n\nTotal 1's: 2 + 10 = 12.\n\nCount of 2's:\n\nUnits place: 2,12,22 (22 is beyond 20, so 2 and 12, so 2 times.\n\nTens place: 20 is the only one, contributing a 2 in the tens place, so 1.\n\nHundreds place: none.\n\nTotal 2's: 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nDifference: 12 - 3 = 9.\n\nLet me count manually:\n\nNumbers from 1 to 20:\n\n1: 1\n2: 2\n3:3\n4:4\n5:5\n6:6\n7:7\n8:8\n9:9\n10:10\n11:11\n12:12\n13:13\n14:14\n15:15\n16:16\n17:17\n18:18\n19:19\n20:20\n\nCount of 1's:\n\nIn units: 1,11 \u2192 2\nIn tens: 10-19 \u2192 10\nTotal: 12.\n\nCount of 2's:\n\nIn units: 2,12 \u2192 2\nIn tens: 20 \u21921\nTotal:3.\n\nDifference: 12 -3 =9. Which matches my earlier calculation. So, the method works for this smaller case.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that for 488 pages, the difference is 90.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we need to count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n### Counting the number of 4's:\n1. **Units place**:\n   - Each set of 10 numbers contributes 1 occurrence of 4.\n   - There are 48 full sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) contribute 1 more occurrence.\n   - Total: \\(48 + 1 = 49\\).\n\n2. **Tens place**:\n   - Each hundred contributes a block of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4.\n   - There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Total: \\(5 \\times 10 = 50\\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place**:\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89.\n\nAdding these, the total number of 4's is:\n\\[ 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\]\n\n### Counting the number of 8's:\n1. **Units place**:\n   - Each set of 10 numbers contributes 1 occurrence of 8.\n   - There are 48 full sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) contribute 1 more occurrence.\n   - Total: \\(48 + 1 = 49\\).\n\n2. **Tens place**:\n   - Each hundred contributes a block of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8.\n   - There are 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), contributing 40 occurrences.\n   - The remaining 9 numbers (480-488) contribute 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: \\(4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49\\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place**:\n   - There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place up to 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\nAdding these, the total number of 8's is:\n\\[ 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\]\n\n### Difference:\nThe number of 4's exceeds the number of 8's by:\n\\[ 188 - 98 = 90 \\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{90}\n\\]"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. That means the page numbers can be 1-digit (1-9), two-digit (10-99), or three-digit (100-488). \n\nI guess I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) separately and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4. \n\nFirst, I'll count how many times 4 appears in the units place. In the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 10, 4 appears once (page 4). From 11 to 20, it appears once again (page 14), and so on. So for each block of 10 pages, 4 appears once in the units place. \n\nNow, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 pages and an additional 8 pages. In each of these 48 blocks, 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial block from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. So total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nNext, I'll count the 4's in the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, 4 appears in the tens place for pages 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, from 101-200, it's pages 140-149, another 10 times. This pattern continues every 100 pages. \n\nSo, how many full hundreds are there in 488 pages? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). In each of these 4 hundreds, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, so the tens digit is 4 in pages 440-449, which is another 10 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So that's another 10. So total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1-400, there are 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 more. So yes, 50 in total.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these pages has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, there are 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4, in each block of 10 pages, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-488, there are 48 full blocks of 10 and an extra 8 pages. So, 48 times in the units place. In the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so that's another 1 time (page 488). So total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each such block has 10 pages where the tens digit is 8. So, how many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-400). In each, the tens digit is 8 for 10 pages, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 9 more 8's in the tens place. So total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, so total 4's are 187 and total 8's are 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me double-check each part to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 48. That's correct because 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4. The last 8 pages (481-488) don't add another 4 in the units place.\n- Tens place: 50. From 1-400, 4 sets of 10 (40-49, 140-149, etc.) each contributing 10, so 40. Then 440-449 in 401-488 adds another 10, so 50. That's correct.\n- Hundreds place: 89, from 400-488. That's correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49. 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last 8 pages, 488 has an 8, so +1, total 49.\n- Tens place: 49. 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so +9, total 49.\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8. From 1-400, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these is 10 pages, so 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 more. So total 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the units place of 8, 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus one more in 488, making 49.\n\nSo, yes, I think the calculations are correct. The difference is 89.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. When I calculated the units place for 4, I said 48 times because from 1-480, there are 480 pages, which is 48 blocks of 10, each contributing one 4. Then from 481-488, the units digit doesn't reach 4 again, so no more 4's in the units place. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place of 4, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so that's correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked each part, so I'm confident the answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** In every block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once. There are 48 full blocks (1-480) and an additional 8 pages (481-488). So, 48 times.\n   - **Tens place:** In every block of 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). From 1-400, there are 4 such blocks, contributing 40 times. From 401-488, 440-449 adds another 10. Total: 50 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, 4 appears 89 times.\n   - **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1-480, 48 times. From 481-488, page 488 adds one more. Total: 49 times.\n   - **Tens place:** In every block of 100, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. From 1-400, 4 blocks contribute 40 times. From 401-488, 480-488 adds 9 times. Total: 49 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 8 never appears as the hundreds digit since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nAlright, so I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll go through each place one by one for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's. \n\nStarting with the units place: In every set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10 and then an additional 8 numbers (481 to 488). In each full set, the units digit 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Now, in the additional 8 numbers, does 484 have a 4 in the units place? Yes, 484 ends with a 4. So that's one more. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers at a time. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From page 1 to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for pages 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), or 4 (400-488). \n\nWait, actually, for the tens place, when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens place can go up to 8 (since the book ends at 488). So let's calculate how many full blocks of 100 there are. From 1-99, there's one block where the tens digit is 4 (40-49). From 100-199, another block (140-149). Similarly, 200-299 has 240-249, and 300-399 has 340-349. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 would be in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So that's 5 blocks in total, each contributing 10 occurrences. So 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall entirely within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's 50 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 occurrences.\n\nAdding up the units, tens, and hundreds places for 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recount. For the units place, I had 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490), but since the book ends at 488, the last set is 481-488, which is 8 numbers, not 10. So in the units place, each full decade (10 numbers) contributes one 4, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus in the last partial decade (481-488), the numbers are 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So only 484 has a 4 in the units place. So units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9. So in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49 in the first hundred). How many hundreds are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So that's five sets. Each set contributes 10 times 4 in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, in the last set (400-488), does the tens digit go up to 8? Yes, so 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's fine. So 50 is correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, in every set of 10 numbers, the units digit is 8 once. So from 1-488, how many full decades are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial decade (481-488), the numbers are 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So 488 has an 8 in the units place. So units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers at a time. For example, 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So let's see how many full blocks there are.\n\nEach hundred contributes one block of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So from 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers), 100-199: 180-189 (10), 200-299: 280-289 (10), 300-399: 380-389 (10), 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers). So that's four full blocks (each contributing 10) and one partial block contributing 9. So total tens place 8's: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me verify. From 1-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189: 10. 200-299: 280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check again. For the tens place, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So that's correct. So total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but units place was 49, tens place 49, so 98 total. Now, the 4's were 188, so the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89. Then, in the tens place, 50, and units 49, totaling 188. For 8's, units 49, tens 49, so 98. So 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a big difference. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I overcounted the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place, for each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So from 0-99: 40-49:10. 100-199:140-149:10. 200-299:240-249:10. 300-399:340-349:10. 400-488:440-449:10. So that's 5 blocks, each with 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 full decades, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus 484, so 49. Correct.\n\nSo 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's: Units place: 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus 488, so 49. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So 4*10 +9=49. So 49 + 49=98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for 8's would contribute, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So yes, 0.\n\nSo the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the units place for 8's. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 48 full sets (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490), but since we stop at 488, the last set is 481-488. So in each full set, 8 appears once, so 48 times, and in the last set, 488 has an 8, so that's one more, totaling 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, 8's: Each hundred has a block where the tens digit is 8, contributing 10 numbers, except the last hundred, which only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So 4 full blocks (each 10) and one partial block (9), totaling 49. Correct.\n\nSo yes, 188 - 98 = 90. So there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488.\n\nI remember that to count the number of times a specific digit appears, like 4 or 8, I need to look at each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds. Maybe I should start by counting how many 4's appear in each place and then do the same for 8's, and then subtract the two totals.\n\nLet me start with the 4's. I'll go through each digit place one by one.\n\nFirst, the units place. In the units place, the digits cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, every 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, pages 4, 14, 24, etc. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place up to page 488?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full cycles of 10. Each cycle contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, page 488 is the last page, so does it add an extra 4? Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so the 48th cycle ends at page 480, and then we have pages 481 to 488. The next 4 in the units place would be at page 484, which is within 481-488. So, that's an additional 4, making it 49 times in the units place for 4's.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Since 488 is the last page, the units digit cycles up to 8, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is within the 481-490 range, but since we only go up to 488, does that affect it? Hmm, actually, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included. So, the number of 4's in the units place is indeed 49 because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens plus one more 4 in the units place at 484. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but 488 is page 488, so the units digits go up to 8, so the 48th set of 10 ends at 480, and then from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1 through 8. So, in the 49th set, the 4 would be at 484, which is within the range. So, yes, 49 times in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of 100 pages. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 pages. Similarly, from 140-149, 240-249, etc. So, how many such blocks are there up to page 488?\n\nEach block is 100 pages, so 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so the last block would be 440-449, right? Because 440-449 is the fifth block, and then 450-488 is beyond that.\n\nSo, each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. So, from 40-49: 10, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 5 blocks, each with 10 4's in the tens place, so 50 times.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4's, every 10 pages, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place up to 488?\n\n488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8. Then, in the remaining pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once at 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 488 is the last page, so the units digit is 8, so yes, that's an additional 8 in the units place. So, 49 times.\n\nNow, the tens place. The digit 8 in the tens place appears in blocks of 100 pages. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last partial block.\n\nEach full block (80-89, 180-189, etc.) contributes 10 8's in the tens place. How many full blocks are there?\n\nFrom 80-89: 10\n180-189:10\n280-289:10\n380-389:10\n480-488: Here, the tens digit is 8, but the units digits go from 0 to 8, so that's 9 pages (480-488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? Because 480 has 8 in the tens place, 481 has 8 in the tens, up to 488. So, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, each block is 100 pages, and within each, the tens digit is 8 for 10 pages (e.g., 80-89). But in the last block, 480-488, it's only 9 pages because 489 would be page 489, which is beyond 488. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the last block.\n\nSo, how many full blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 full blocks contributing 10 each, and one partial block contributing 9.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: (4 * 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, yes, 4*10=40 plus 9=49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems a bit low. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, in the units place, 49 times, and in the tens place, 49 times, so total 98. That seems correct because up to 488, the 8's in the hundreds place don't occur.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's:188, total 8's:98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49 times.\n\nTens place: 50 times (from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449, which is 5 blocks, each 10, so 5*10=50).\n\nHundreds place: 89 times (from 400-488, which is 89 pages).\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49 times.\n\nTens place: 49 times (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488, which is 4 full blocks of 10 and one partial block of 9, so 4*10 +9=49).\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nThus, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 4's. Are there 5 blocks of 10 where the tens digit is 4? Let's list them:\n\n40-49:10\n140-149:10\n240-249:10\n340-349:10\n440-449:10\n\nYes, that's five blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nAnd in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's there.\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, plus one more at 484, so 49.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, plus one at 488, so 49.\n\nTens place: 80-89:10\n180-189:10\n280-289:10\n380-389:10\n480-488:9\n\nSo, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit surprised that the difference is 90. Let me check another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately.\n\nAnother approach: For each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFor 4's: As before, 49.\n\nFor 8's:49.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4's:50.\n\nFor 8's:49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor 4's:89.\n\nFor 8's:0.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me think about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nAnd in the tens place, 50 4's, and 49 8's.\n\nUnits place: both have 49.\n\nSo, the difference comes mainly from the hundreds place, which adds 89 4's, and the tens place adds 1 more 4 than 8's (50 vs 49).\n\nSo, 89 +1 =90. That's where the difference comes from.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488.\n\nI remember that to count the number of times a specific digit appears, like 4 or 8, I need to look at each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Maybe I should handle each place one by one for both digits and then compare the totals.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in a sequence of numbers. But since we're starting from 1, the first page is 1, so maybe the distribution isn't perfectly even, but for large numbers, it should be close.\n\nWait, actually, for the units place, every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) will have each digit from 0-9 exactly once in the units place. So, for page numbers 1-488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? Let me calculate that.\n\n488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). In each complete block, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears once. So, for 48 complete blocks, each digit appears 48 times in the units place. Now, in the partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, they are equal.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488 pages mean 48 full tens and 8 extra. So, yes, each digit appears 48 times in the units place for the full blocks, and then in the last 8 numbers, 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once. So, total units place counts: 48 +1 =49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, up to 9 for 90-99. So, in each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSince we have 488 pages, that's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). Let's calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nIn each full hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and the digit 8 appears 10 times (80-89). So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times for each digit. Now, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in this range, how many times do 4 and 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nLooking at 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-488). Each of these tens digits occurs 10 times except the last one, which only goes up to 488. Wait, but 488 is part of the 80-89 tens group? No, wait, 481-490 would be the 80-89 tens group, but we only go up to 488, which is 8 pages (481-488). So, the tens digit for 481-488 is 8, but only 8 times? Wait, no, 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for all of them, but each of these 8 numbers has the tens digit as 8. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place in 401-488?\n\nWait, let me think. From 401-410, the tens digit is 0. From 411-420, it's 1, and so on up to 480-489, which would be tens digit 8. But since we stop at 488, the numbers 481-488 have the tens digit 8, which is 8 numbers, so the digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place in this partial hundred. Similarly, the digit 4 appears in the tens place from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 times. So, in the tens place for 401-488, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which only appears 8 times because we stop at 488. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, it's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. For the digit 8 in the tens place, it's from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers, but wait, 480 is included, right? Wait, 480 is page 480, and 488 is the last page, so from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers. Wait, but 480 is included, so that's 9 numbers, meaning the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in 480-488. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 8 times because from 481-488, but 480 is also part of the 401-488 range, so 480 would have tens digit 8? No, wait, 480 is 480, which is in the 400-499 range, so its tens digit is 8, right? So, 480 is included in 401-488, so the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 times. So, in the partial hundred (401-488), the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (440-449), and the digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n\nSo, total in the tens place: 4 appears 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 = 50 times, and 8 appears 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times for 8. So, 40 + 9 = 49 for 8 in the tens place, and 40 +10=50 for 4 in the tens place.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. So, 4 is ahead by 1 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. Wait, no, 400-488 would have hundreds digit 4. So, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (400-488 inclusive). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. What about 8? Well, in the hundreds place, 8 would appear from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit across all places.\n\nFor digit 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, but wait, that can't be right because 188 - 98 is 90, which seems like a big difference. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 49 for both 4 and 8, which seems correct. In the tens place, 4 had 50 and 8 had 49, so that's correct. In the hundreds place, 4 had 89 and 8 had 0. So, 49 +50 +89 = 188 for 4, and 49 +49 +0=98 for 8. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. So, 4 appears 90 times more than 8.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the tens place for 8. I had 40 from the full hundreds, and then in the last partial hundred (401-488), I thought 8 appears 9 times in the tens place. So, 40 +9=49 for 8 in the tens place. And for 4, it was 40 +10=50. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place in the partial hundred. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does each appear?\n\nEach tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which appears 9 times because we stop at 488. So, for the tens digit 8, it's from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 4 in the tens place, it's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, yes, 40 +10=50 and 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, but I'm thinking, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, which is a lot. So, that's a big contributor to the total count for 4.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From page 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those pages. So, that's 89 times. Correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nDigit 4:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50=99; 99+89=188\n\nDigit 8:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 4 appears 90 times more than 8.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. For example, in the units place, from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear?\n\nEach 10 pages, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 488/10=48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in the last 8 pages (481-488), 4 appears once at 484. So, 48+1=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the units place, same thing: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, and in the last 8 pages, 8 appears once at 488. So, 48+1=49. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4: each hundred contributes 10 times, so 4 hundreds would be 40, plus in the last partial hundred, 440-449, which is 10 times, so 50 total. Correct.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place: 4 hundreds contribute 40, plus in the last partial hundred, 480-488, which is 9 times, so 49 total. Correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, only 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times. 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488. Correct.\n\nSo, the total counts are 188 for 4 and 98 for 8, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again: 188 -98=90. So, 4 appears 90 times more than 8.\n\nWait, but let me just check if I counted the hundreds place correctly. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, right? Because 488 -400 +1=89. So, yes, 89 times. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place for the first 480 pages.\n   - In the last 8 pages (481-488), both 4 and 8 appear once.\n   - Total for 4: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total for 8: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - Each digit appears 10 times per hundred, totaling 40 times for each digit in the first 400 pages.\n   - In the last 88 pages (401-488), 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total for 4: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total for 8: 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - 4 appears 89 times from page 400 to 488.\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total for 4: 89\n   - Total for 8: 0\n\n**Total Counts**:\n- 4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference**: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI guess I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense. \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll need to look at each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: The digits cycle every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So I can calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488 and then see how many 4's are there. \n\nWait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. In each group of 10, the units digit cycles through 0 to 9, so 4 appears once in each group. So that's 48 times. Now, in the extra 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits are 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So total 4's in units place are 48.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So in each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times. Now, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each of the 4 full hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So that's 4 times 10, which is 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So in the 400s, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490. But since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So that's another 10 times. So total 4's in the tens place are 40 (from the full hundreds) plus 10 (from the partial hundred) equals 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So there are 187 fours in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place again. Every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So similar to the 4's, but let's check. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? \n\n488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Now, the extra 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once here (at 488). So total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So for each hundred, that's 10 times. There are 4 full hundreds, so 4 times 10 is 40. Now, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes up to 8 (as in 480-488). So the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but in the tens place, 8 is in 480-489, but we only go up to 488, so that's 9 numbers. So 9 times. So total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So 0 times here.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that's 98. But earlier, I thought the hundreds digit for 8 would be zero, so total 8's are 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8. In the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So 9 times, correct. So 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 49. That seems right.\n\nSo, total 4's: 187, total 8's: 98.\n\nNow, how many more 4's than 8's? 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, when I calculated the hundreds place for 4's, I considered 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's there. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's, in the units place, I had 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus one more at 488, so 49. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for 8's, each hundred contributes 10 times, so 4 times 10 is 40. Then in the partial hundred, 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSo total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\nSo 187 - 98 = 89. So there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the tens place correctly for 4's. I had 50 for tens place. Let me recount.\n\nIn the tens place for 4's, each hundred contributes 10 times, so 4 hundreds give 40. Then in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So 40 + 10 = 50. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, 40 from full hundreds, plus 9 from the partial hundred, totaling 49. Correct.\n\nSo the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nI think that's correct. So the answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (once every 10 numbers, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (10 times per hundred for 4 hundreds, plus 10 in the partial hundred 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488, inclusive).\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (48 full groups plus one at 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (10 times per hundred for 4 hundreds, plus 9 in the partial hundred 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences (no page numbers reach 800).\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 all the way up to 488.\n\nI guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by considering the different positions where the digits can appear: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll handle each position separately for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the digit 4. I'll go through each position one by one.\n\n1. **Units place for 4:**\n   - The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place.\n   - To find out how many times 4 appears in the units place up to page 488, I can calculate how many complete blocks of 10 there are and then see if there's a partial block.\n   - 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and an additional 8 numbers (481 to 488).\n   - In each complete block, 4 appears once, so 48 times from the complete blocks.\n   - Now, in the partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once here (page 484).\n   - Total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place for 4:**\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For each block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n   - Let's see how many complete hundreds we have in 488. The hundreds digit goes up to 4 (since 488 is in the 400s).\n   - There are four complete hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and the last partial hundred is 400-488.\n   - Wait, actually, 488 is within the 400-499 range, but since we're only going up to 488, that's 89 numbers beyond 400.\n   - For each complete hundred (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit is 4 in the block 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349. Each of these contributes 10 times.\n   - So, 4 complete hundreds mean 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40.\n   - Now, the last partial hundred is 400-488. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 in the tens place. So, the tens digit is 4 in the numbers 440-449. That's 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 times.\n   - Wait, but 488 is less than 499, so 440-449 is entirely within 400-488, right? So, yes, 10 times.\n   - So, total tens place 4's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from partial hundred) = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place for 4:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 only in the pages from 400 to 488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place?\n   - From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - Each of these pages has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, for the hundreds place, from 400 to 488 is 89 pages, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nFor the tens place, each hundred contributes 10, and there are four complete hundreds, so 4*10=40. Then the partial hundred (400-488) has another 10 (440-449). So, 40+10=50. That seems right.\n\nUnits place: 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), units digits go up to 8, so 4 appears once (484). So, 48+1=49. That's correct.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place for 8:**\n   - Similar to 4, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so in every block of 10, 8 appears once.\n   - 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing 1, so 48.\n   - The partial block is 481-488, units digits 1-8, so 8 appears once (page 488).\n   - So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place for 8:**\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - How many complete hundreds are there in 488? Four: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399.\n   - Each of these contributes 10 times, so 4*10=40.\n   - Now, the partial hundred is 400-488. The tens digit here goes from 0 to 8. So, 80-89 in this range would be 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 times.\n   - Wait, but in the tens place, 8 appears in 480-489, but since we stop at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n   - So, total tens place 8's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 (from partial hundred) = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place for 8:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is from 800 to 899. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8.\n   - So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8 in the partial hundred. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers, right? Because 480 is included, and 488 is the last, so 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, 9 times. So, yes, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place for 4. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nWait, another way to check: total number of digits used in the page numbers.\n\nBut maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, let me recount the 4's and 8's.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 48 full tens (each contributing 1) + 1 in the last partial ten (484) = 49.\n- Tens: 4 full hundreds (each contributing 10) + 10 in the partial hundred (440-449) = 50.\n- Hundreds: 89 (from 400-488).\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 48 full tens + 1 in the last partial ten (488) = 49.\n- Tens: 4 full hundreds (each contributing 10) + 9 in the partial hundred (480-488) = 49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI remember that when dealing with digit counting problems, it's helpful to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. So maybe I should calculate the number of times the digit 4 appears in each place and do the same for the digit 8, then find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, like 4, 14, 24, etc. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once in the units place, like 8, 18, 28, etc. \n\nSo, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 pages (since 488 = 48*10 + 8). In each complete block, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So for 48 blocks, that's 48 4's and 48 8's. \n\nNow, in the partial block of 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So in this partial block, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). So adding these, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So the units place contributes equally to both digits, 49 each.\n\nNext, I'll move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place in 80-89, another 10 numbers. \n\nBut since the book has 488 pages, I need to consider how many full hundreds there are and any partial hundreds. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred from 401-488.\n\nIn each full hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (40-49) and 8 for 10 pages (80-89). So for 4 full hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 4's and 4*10 = 40 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the partial hundred from 401-488. Let's see, the tens digit here goes from 0 to 8. So in 401-409, the tens digit is 0, in 410-419 it's 1, and so on up to 480-488 where the tens digit is 8. \n\nLooking at the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? From 440-449, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, how many times does 8 appear? From 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages. \n\nWait, that's not quite right. Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 9 numbers. So in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). \n\nSo adding this to the previous counts: for 4's in the tens place, it's 40 + 10 = 50, and for 8's, it's 40 + 9 = 49. So the tens place contributes 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, 400-488 would have a hundreds digit of 4, right? So let's see how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. How about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. \n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit across all places.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then the last 8 pages (481-488) have one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So units place: 48 +1=49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 hundreds give 40 each. Then in the last partial hundred (401-488), 440-449 is 10 4's, and 480-488 is 9 8's. So 40 +10=50 for 4's, and 40 +9=49 for 8's. That seems right.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 pages where the hundreds digit is 4. 8's in the hundreds place don't appear because the book doesn't reach 800. So 89 for 4's, 0 for 8's.\n\nAdding up, 49+50+89=188 for 4's, and 49+49+0=98 for 8's. The difference is 188-98=90. \n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: from 1-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, when I considered 480-488, I thought it's 9 pages, but actually, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 pages. So 9 8's in the tens place in the last partial hundred. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the units place, when I calculated 488 pages, I divided by 10 to get 48 full blocks and 8 pages left. So in the units place, 48*1=48, plus 1 more in the last 8 pages if 4 is present. Since 484 is within 481-488, that adds one more 4, making it 49. Similarly, 488 is in that range, so one more 8, making it 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, in each hundred, 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens digit. Then in the last partial hundred, 440-449 is 10 4's, and 480-488 is 9 8's. So 10+40=50 for 4's, and 9+40=49 for 8's. Correct.\n\nSo adding up, 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188\n\n8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0 (hundreds)=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I was calculating the units place, I considered 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So that's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, each hundred has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens digit. So 4 hundreds give 40 each. Then in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So 440-449 is 10 pages where tens digit is 4, contributing 10 4's. Then 480-488 is 9 pages where tens digit is 8, contributing 9 8's. So that's correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 4's. 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo the total counts are correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98. The difference is 90. So there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - 488 pages have 48 full blocks (480 pages) and 8 extra pages.\n   - 48 * 1 = 48 4's and 48 * 1 = 48 8's from full blocks.\n   - In the last 8 pages (481-488), 484 adds one more 4 and 488 adds one more 8.\n   - Total: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - 4 full hundreds (1-400) give 4 * 10 = 40 4's and 4 * 10 = 40 8's.\n   - In the last partial hundred (401-488), 440-449 adds 10 4's, and 480-488 adds 9 8's.\n   - Total: 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 400-488 contributes 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n   - 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI guess I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense. \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, we take the integer part, which is 48. So that gives 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place. But wait, the last set goes up to 480, and then we have pages 481 to 488. So I need to check if there's an extra 4 in the units place beyond that. From 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so no extra 4 there. So units place gives 48 fours.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive pages every 100 pages. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, etc. So how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds. Each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. But wait, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 4 for pages 440-449. That's another 10 pages, so that's 10 more. So total tens place fours are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1-100: 40-49, that's 10 fours. 101-200: 140-149, another 10. 201-300: 240-249, another 10. 301-400: 340-349, another 10. Then 401-488: 440-449, another 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. Okay, that makes sense.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. How many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So each of these pages has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So there are 187 fours in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's using the same method.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, every 10 pages, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So from 1 to 488, that's 48 full sets of 10, giving 48 eights. But wait, in the last partial set from 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so page 488 has an 8 in the units place. So that's one more. So units place eights are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive pages every 100 pages. For example, 80-89, 180-189, etc. How many such sets are there in 488 pages? 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 full hundreds. Each contributes 10 eights, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So that's 9 more eights in the tens place. So total tens place eights are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check: From 1-100: 80-89, 10 eights. 101-200: 180-189, another 10. 201-300: 280-289, another 10. 301-400: 380-389, another 10. Then 401-488: 480-488, which is 9 pages. So that's 4*10 + 9 = 49. Okay, that's correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So hundreds place eights are 0.\n\nAdding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So fours total 187 and eights total 98. So the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems a bit high. Let me recount the fours and eights.\n\nFor fours:\n- Units: 48 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, and no extra 4 in the units beyond 480)\nWait, earlier I thought units place fours were 48, but when I considered eights, I had 49 because the last set included 488. So for fours, units place: from 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The last term is 484, which is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So n-1 = (484-4)/10 = 48, so n=49. Wait, that's 49 fours in the units place. Did I make a mistake earlier?\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated the units place for fours. Let me think again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, and in each cycle, 4 appears once. So from 1 to 488, how many complete cycles of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48 fours. But wait, in the 48th cycle, it's 480-488, so units digits go from 0-8. So the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is within the 480-488 range. So that's 48 fours in the units place. So I think my initial count of 48 was correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in the units place, from 8,18,...,488. The last term is 488, so how many terms? 488 is the 49th term because (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So units place eights are 49, which matches my earlier count.\n\nSo for fours:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50 (from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449)\n- Hundreds: 89 (400-488)\nTotal fours: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\nFor eights:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488)\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nSo the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the hundreds place for fours was 89, but that seems correct because from 400 to 488, each page has a 4 in the hundreds place, which is 89 pages. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the final answer should be 89 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488.\n\nI guess the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers and do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every set of ten numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times. But wait, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so does 484 have a 4 in the units place? Yes, it does. So that's one more 4. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers in each hundred. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. How many such sets are there? Since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, but page numbers start at 1, so the hundreds digit starts at 0 (for pages 1-99), then 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488).\n\nSo, for the tens place, the digit 4 appears in each hundred block once every ten numbers. Let's calculate how many times.\n\nIn the 0-99 range (pages 1-99), the tens digit is 4 for pages 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nIn the 100-199 range, it's 140-149, another 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, in 200-299, it's 240-249, 10 times.\n\nIn 300-399, it's 340-349, 10 times.\n\nNow, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for pages 440-449. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 440-449 is within that. So that's another 10 times.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 more. So, adding them up: 10 (0-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 50 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check: in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 from 440 to 449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 10 times.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nWait, but let me think again: the hundreds digit is 4 only for 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, in each set of ten numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488? 48 complete sets (1-480) and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in the units place, 8 appears 48 times, plus in the last partial set, 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers in each hundred block. For example, 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n\nLet's calculate how many times.\n\nIn the 0-99 range, the tens digit is 8 for 80-89, which is 10 times.\n\nIn the 100-199 range, it's 180-189, another 10 times.\n\nIn the 200-299 range, 280-289, another 10 times.\n\nIn the 300-399 range, 380-389, another 10 times.\n\nIn the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here.\n\nWait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times.\n\nSo, adding up: 10 (0-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 49 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me double-check that: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40, plus 9 is 49. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800 onwards. But the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds: 0, so total 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, for the 4's, I had 188, and for 8's, 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me go through the 4's again:\n\nUnits place: 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in the last 8 numbers (481-488), 484 has a 4 in units place, so 49.\n\nTens place: 10 in each hundred block, from 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 complete sets, 48, plus 488, so 49.\n\nTens place: 10 in each of the first four hundreds (0-399), so 4*10=40, plus in 400-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9. Total tens place: 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0, since 800 is beyond 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. In the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 40 from the first four hundreds plus 9, totaling 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 10 in each of the first four hundreds (0-399) and 9 in 400-488, totaling 49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times the hundreds digit is 4. That seems correct.\n\nAnd for 8's, the hundreds digit never appears because the book ends at 488, so no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Each set of 10 numbers (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) has one 4 in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488 pages, contributing 48 fours.\n   - The last partial set (481-488) includes 484, adding one more 4.\n   - **Total units place 4's:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit is 4 in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each hundred block (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) contributes 10 fours in the tens place.\n   - **Total tens place 4's:** 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total hundreds place 4's:** 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, each set of 10 numbers contributes one 8.\n   - 48 complete sets plus 488 adds one more.\n   - **Total units place 8's:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - The first four hundred blocks (0-399) contribute 10 eights each, totaling 40.\n   - In 400-488, the range is 480-488, contributing 9 eights.\n   - **Total tens place 8's:** 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total hundreds place 8's:** 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI remember that to count the number of times a specific digit appears, I can analyze each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds, etc. So, maybe I should look at each place (units, tens, hundreds) and count how many times 4 appears and how many times 8 appears in each place. Then, I can sum them up and find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times a specific digit appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then considering any remainder.\n\nWait, but since the book has 488 pages, let me think. For the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often except maybe for the last few pages if 488 isn't a multiple of 10. Let me calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra pages.\n\nIn each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does the digit 8. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 times 1, which is 48, plus any additional 4's in the remaining 8 pages. Similarly, for 8's, it's 48 times 1, which is 48, plus any additional 8's in the remaining 8 pages.\n\nWait, the remaining 8 pages after 480 would be 481 to 488. So, looking at the units digits here: 481 has 1, 482 has 2, 483 has 3, 484 has 4, 485 has 5, 486 has 6, 487 has 7, and 488 has 8. So, in the units place of the remaining 8 pages, there's one 4 (at 484) and one 8 (at 488). Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the total number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, they're equal.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit is 0 for 0-9, 1 for 10-19, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred.\n\nSince the book has 488 pages, let's see how many complete hundreds there are. 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages beyond that (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for each hundred, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times in the tens place. Therefore, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times each.\n\nNow, let's look at the remaining 88 pages (401-488). The tens digit in this range goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, we can count how many times it appears.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, each digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times, except for the last one, which might be less. Let me think: from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). For each tens digit d, the numbers would be 4d0 to 4d9, but since we only go up to 488, the last group (tens digit 8) only goes up to 488, which is 488. So, how many numbers are in each group?\n\nFor tens digits 0 to 7, each group has 10 numbers: 401-410 (tens digit 0), 411-420 (tens digit 1), ..., 471-480 (tens digit 7). So, each of these digits appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nFor the tens digit 8, the numbers are 481-488. That's 8 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 8 times here.\n\nSo, in the tens place, for the remaining 88 pages:\n\n- Digit 4: How many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see, in the 400s, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449. So, that's 10 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, right? 440 is within 401-488, so yes, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place here.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but in reality, the hundreds digit is 4, so the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but the actual tens digits are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, for each of these, how many times does 4 appear?\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that. The tens digit is 4 in the range 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in the 400s.\n\nSimilarly, digit 8 appears in the tens place in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480 is the start, then 481, ..., up to 488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but 480 is included, so from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the 400s.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it's 8 times, but now I'm counting 9. Let me check: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times the tens digit is 8.\n\nWait, but in the 400s, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, each for 10 numbers except the last one, which is only 9 numbers because we stop at 488. So, for the tens digit 8, it's 9 times in the 400s.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go up to 8, but let me confirm: 401-488 is 88 pages. So, 401-488 is 88 numbers, right? 488 - 401 + 1 = 88.\n\nSo, in the tens place, the digits go from 0 (for 401-410) to 8 (for 480-488). Each tens digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times, as we saw.\n\nSo, in the tens place for the remaining 88 pages:\n\n- Digit 4 appears 10 times (in 440-449).\n- Digit 8 appears 9 times (in 480-488).\n\nTherefore, in the tens place:\n\n- Total 4's: 4 hundreds * 10 (from each hundred) + 10 (from 440-449) = 4*10 + 10 = 50.\n- Total 8's: 4 hundreds * 10 (from each hundred) + 9 (from 480-488) = 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because in each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and so does 8. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 for each digit. Then, in the remaining 88 pages, for 4's in the tens place, it's 10 times (from 440-449), and for 8's, it's 9 times (from 480-488).\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: in the 400s, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times in the 400s.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in tens place: 4*10 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place: 4*10 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 401-488) = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 49 times. So, 4's are more by 1 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought in each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place, so 4 hundreds would give 40 each. Then, in the 400s, 440-449 gives another 10 for 4's, and 480-488 gives 9 for 8's. So, yes, 50 vs 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case since the book has 488 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8? The hundreds digit can only be 1,2,3,4 in this book, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\nTotal 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, now, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the units place: 488 pages. Each 10 pages have one 4 and one 8 in the units place. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1 to 4 and 1 to 8. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So, units place: 48 +1=49 for 4's, and 48 +1=49 for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place. 4 hundreds would be 4*10=40 each. Then, in the 400s, 440-449 gives another 10 for 4's, and 480-488 gives 9 for 8's. So, 4's: 40 +10=50, 8's:40 +9=49. That adds up.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 doesn't appear at all. So, 89 for 4's, 0 for 8's.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98.\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I feel like that's a big difference. Let me check if I counted correctly in each place.\n\nWait, in the tens place for the 400s, I considered that 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 times 4 in the tens place. Similarly, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times 8 in the tens place. That seems correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about the hundreds place: from 1-99, hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's. From 100-199, hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's. Similarly, 200-299: hundreds digit 2; 300-399: hundreds digit 3. So, only 400-488 has hundreds digit 4, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nSo, yes, 89 4's in hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place in the 400s. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except the last one, which is cut short. So, for 401-488, which is 88 numbers, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Each tens digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times, as we saw. So, in the tens place, 4 appears in the tens digit when the tens digit is 4, which is 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears in the tens place in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo, I think my counts are accurate.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot. Let me try another approach to verify.\n\nAlternative approach: Count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of 4's in units place: floor(488/10) = 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, check the remaining 8 pages: 481-488. The units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once. So, total 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of 4's in tens place: For each hundred, there's 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. There are 4 hundreds (1-400), so 4*10=40. Then, in the 400s, 440-449 is another 10, so total 40 +10=50.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's in hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's:49 +50 +89=188.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of 8's in units place: floor(488/10)=48, plus check the remaining 8 pages: 481-488. Units digits 1-8, so 8 appears once. So, 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of 8's in tens place: For each hundred, 10 numbers where tens digit is 8, so 4*10=40. Then, in the 400s, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9. Total 40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumber of 8's in hundreds place: 0, since the hundreds digits go up to 4.\n\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98.\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total groups of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full groups (480 pages) and 8 extra pages (481-488).\n   - 4's: 48 (from groups) + 1 (484) = 49.\n   - 8's: 48 (from groups) + 1 (488) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - 4 complete hundreds (1-400): 4\u00d710=40 for each digit.\n   - Remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n     - 4's: 10 times (440-449).\n     - 8's: 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 +10=50.\n   - Total 8's: 40 +9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4's: 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8's: 0 times (hundreds digits are 1,2,3,4).\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188.\n   - 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 -98=90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI guess the first thing I should do is figure out how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll need to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten and then an extra 8 numbers (481-488). So, in each complete set, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 numbers, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so there's no 4 there. So, total 4's in the units place: 48.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for every set of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, how many complete sets of 100 are there in 488? That's 4 (since 4*100=400) with 88 numbers remaining. So, each complete set of 100 contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Well, from 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490. Wait, but 488 is less than 490, so from 481-488, the tens digit is 8. So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, that adds another 10 4's. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 (from the complete sets) + 10 (from the remaining) = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: For the hundreds digit, 4 appears from page 400 to 488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nWait, let me check that. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again.\n\nUnits place: Just like with 4, every set of ten numbers has one 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets of ten, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so that's one more 8. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place.\n\nTens place: For the tens digit, every set of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, from 1 to 400, there are 4 complete sets of 100, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, from 401 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? The tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488), so 9 8's in the tens place. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, 480-488 is when the tens digit is 8, and that's 9 numbers (480, 481,...,488). So, that's 9 8's in the tens place. Therefore, total 8's in the tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 401-488) = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, yes, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 in units, 49 in tens, and 0 in hundreds. So, 49 + 49 is 98. Hmm, but let me double-check the tens place. From 1-400, 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, 40 + 9 = 49. So, yes, 49 in tens place. Units place is 49 as well. So, total 98 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier, for 4's, I had 187, and for 8's, 98. So, the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, that seems quite a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 times. Because 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4. The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) don't have a 4 in the units place. So, 48.\n\n- Tens place: From 1-400, 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more 4's. So, total 50 in tens place.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so that's one more 8. So, 49.\n\n- Tens place: From 1-400, 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 40. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more 8's. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, as before.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I feel like that might be too high. Let me check another way. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. But wait, 480 is included in 401-488, right? So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I should think about the units place for 8's again. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many 8's are there in the units place?\n\nThe number of 8's in the units place is equal to the number of times 8 appears in the units digit from 1 to 488. So, for each ten numbers, there's one 8. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so that's one more 8. So, total 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, every 100 numbers, 10 times 8 appears in the tens place. So, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more 8's. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, yes, 49 in units and 49 in tens, total 98 8's.\n\nSo, 187 4's minus 98 8's is 89. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again: When counting the hundreds place for 4's, I considered from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, each of those has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 4's. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if 488 is included. 488 is page 488, so yes, it's included in the 400-488 range, so that's correct.\n\nWait, another way to check: Let me think about how many digits are printed in total. Each page number from 1 to 488. Pages 1-9: 1 digit each, so 9 pages. Pages 10-99: 2 digits each, 90 pages, so 180 digits. Pages 100-488: 3 digits each, 488 - 99 = 389 pages, so 389 * 3 = 1167 digits. Total digits: 9 + 180 + 1167 = 1356 digits.\n\nBut I don't know if that helps me directly, but maybe I can check the total number of 4's and 8's against this.\n\nWait, 187 4's and 98 8's. So, 187 + 98 = 285. That's way less than 1356, which makes sense because each digit place is being counted separately.\n\nWait, maybe I should check the count for 4's again. Let me try a different approach.\n\nFor each digit place, count how many times 4 appears:\n\nUnits place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nIt's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. So, the last one is 484, which is 484 = 40*10 + 4. So, 48 times. Then, since 488 is beyond 484, the next would be 494, which is beyond 488, so only 48 times. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48, but then in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), units digits go up to 8, so 481,482,...,488, so the units digits are 1-8, so no 4 in the units place. So, total 48 4's in units place.\n\nTens place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nIt's in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n\nEach of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 more. So, 5*10=50. Wait, but earlier I thought from 1-400, it's 4 sets, each contributing 10, so 40, then from 401-488, 440-449 is another 10, so total 50. So, yes, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 400-488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nSo, total 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49 times, as before.\n\nTens place: 49 times, as before.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 98.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. From 1-400, 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 40. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more 8's. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I think about 480-488, that's 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488. So, 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, 9 8's.\n\nSo, 40 + 9 = 49 in the tens place.\n\nUnits place: 49, as before.\n\nSo, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, yes, 98 8's.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI guess I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, the units place. The digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, there's a 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. So, 48 times in the units place. Wait, but wait, let me check that. For example, from 1 to 10, there's one 4 (page 4). From 11 to 20, another 4 (page 14), and so on. So, up to page 480, that's 48 times. But page 488 is the last page, which is 488. So, does page 488 have a 4 in the units place? No, it's 8. So, actually, from 1 to 488, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 because the last 4 in the units place is at 484, right? Wait, no, 484 is page 484, which is within 488. So, maybe it's 49? Wait, let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to calculate it as floor division. So, the number of times a digit appears in the units place is given by (n // 10) * 1, plus an extra if the remainder is >= the digit. Hmm, maybe I should use a formula for this. \n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as for each digit place, the number of times a digit appears can be calculated using a formula. Let me recall. For a given digit d and a position (units, tens, hundreds), the count can be calculated by dividing the number into higher, current, and lower parts.\n\nBut maybe for simplicity, I can consider each digit place separately.\n\nStarting with units place for 4's:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10, which is 488 // 10 = 48, and then check if the remainder is >=4. The remainder when 488 is divided by 10 is 8, which is greater than 4, so we add 1 more. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but that can't be right because 488 is the last page, and 488 is 488, so the units digit is 8, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484. So, from 1 to 484, there are 484//10 = 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then from 481 to 484, the units digit 4 appears once more, so that's 48 + 1 = 49. But wait, 484 is the 48th group of 10, right? Wait, no, 480 is the 48th group of 10, so 480 is the 48th, and then 481-490 would be the 49th group, but since we only go up to 488, in the units place, we have 48 full groups (1-480) each contributing one 4, and then from 481-488, the units digit 4 appears once at 484. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 4's in the units place.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, in the units place, the 4's are at 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The first term is 4, the last term is 484, common difference 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, yes, 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place for 4's. In the tens place, 4 appears in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place.\n\nSo, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Let's see. The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10, and so on. So, up to 440-449, that's five blocks. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. Now, the next block would be 540-549, but 540 is beyond 488, so we don't include that. So, how many blocks do we have? Let's see: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times.\n\nWait, but let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50 times.\n\nNow, the hundreds place for 4's. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's.\n\nStarting with the units place for 8's. Similar to the 4's, but let's go through it.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Again, every 10 numbers, so 488 // 10 = 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. The remainder is 8, which is equal to 8, so we add 1 more. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but let's check with the sequence: 8,18,28,...,488. So, the first term is 8, last term is 488. Common difference is 10. Number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times.\n\nNow, the tens place for 8's. The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nHow many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: 80-89 is the first, then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. The next would be 480-489, but 480-488 is within 488, so that's another block. Wait, 480-489 is 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? Because 480-489 all have 8 in the tens place. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but each has 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 occurrences, not 10. Hmm, so I need to adjust for that.\n\nWait, let me think again. Each full block of 100 numbers contributes one block of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, in 1-100, 80-89 is one block, contributing 10 8's. In 101-200, 180-189 is another block, another 10. Similarly, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10. Now, in 400-488, the next block would be 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but each has 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 occurrences, not 10.\n\nSo, total number of blocks where the tens digit is 8 is 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10, and then the partial block 480-488 contributing 9. So, total is 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but let me check using the formula. The number of times 8 appears in the tens place can be calculated as follows: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, from 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more. So, total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but another way: The number of times 8 appears in the tens place is calculated by:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds = 488 // 100 = 4.\n\nFor each complete hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9, so each complete hundred contributes 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nNow, the remaining part is 488 % 100 = 88. So, in the remaining 88 numbers (from 401 to 488), how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? The tens digit is 8 from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nOkay, so 49 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place for 8's. The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 times.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. So, 49 + 49 = 98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's and 8's.\n\nLet me go through the 4's again.\n\nUnits place: 49 times. That's correct because from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place, and the last one is at 484, which is within 488, so 49 times.\n\nTens place: 50 times. Wait, earlier I thought it was 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. But let me check again. The blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 times. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 89 times, because from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Correct.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49 times, correct as above.\n\nTens place: 49 times, correct as above.\n\nHundreds place: 0 times, correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When counting the units place for 8's, I included 488, which is the last page. So, 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's correct. Similarly, in the tens place, 480-488 includes 488, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place for 8's again. The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. So, how many terms? The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The common difference is 10. So, number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the last block contributes 9, so 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, the total 8's are 49 +49=98.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 488 -400 +1=89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 times. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, 188 -98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. Did I count correctly in each digit place?\n\nAnother way to approach this is to consider each digit place separately and use a formula for each.\n\nFor the units place, the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to n is:\n\nunits = (n // 10) * 1 + min(max(n % 10 - d + 1, 0), 1)\n\nWait, maybe that's more complicated, but let me try.\n\nAlternatively, for units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's in units place = floor(488 /10) + (1 if 488 %10 >=4 else 0)\n\nWhich is 48 + (1 since 8>=4) =49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: floor(488/10)=48, and since 488%10=8>=8, so 48+1=49.\n\nFor the tens place, the formula is:\n\ntens = (n // 100) *10 + min(max((n % 100) - d*10 +1, 0),10)\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as:\n\nFor each digit d in the tens place, the number of times it appears is:\n\n(number of complete hundreds) *10 + extra.\n\nSo, for 4 in tens place:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds = 488 // 100 =4.\n\nEach complete hundred contributes 10 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, the remaining part is 488 %100=88.\n\nIn the remaining 88 numbers, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, 440-449 is fully included, so that's another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so it's 10 more. So, total is 4*10 +10=50. Which matches our earlier count.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds=4, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40.\n\nRemaining part is 88. The next block where tens digit is 8 is 480-489, but we only go up to 488, so that's 9 numbers. So, 40 +9=49.\n\nWhich matches our earlier count.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\nFor 4 in hundreds place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in hundreds place is from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nFor 8 in hundreds place: since 800-899 is beyond 488, it's 0.\n\nSo, all counts check out.\n\nThus, the number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '4' appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of 10, contributing 48 '4's. The last group ends at 484, which is within 488, adding one more '4'. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** '4' appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks (including 440-449), each contributing 10 '4's. Total: 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400 to 488, there are 89 numbers, each with a '4' in the hundreds place.

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. For each place, I'll calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same for 8. So, for example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (at 4) and 8 appears once (at 8). This pattern repeats every 10 numbers.\n\nNow, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups and a partial group of 8 numbers (from 481 to 488). \n\nIn each complete group of 10, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for 48 complete groups, that's 48 times each for 4 and 8. Now, the partial group from 481 to 488: the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial group, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). \n\nSo, total units place occurrences:\n- 4's: 48 (from complete groups) + 1 (partial group) = 49\n- 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\nWait, that's the same number. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. From 1 to 480, there are 48 groups of 10, so 48 each for 4 and 8 in the units place. Then from 481 to 488, units digits are 1-8. So, 4 appears at 484, and 8 appears at 488. So yes, both get one more, making it 49 each. So, units place doesn't contribute to a difference.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred.\n\nSo, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49), and the same for 8 (e.g., 80-89). \n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, actually, 488 is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nSo, for each hundred, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10=40 each. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place from 440-449, which is 10 times, but wait, 488 is less than 490, so from 401-488, the tens digits go up to 8. So, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, but 488 is the last page, so that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, for the last partial hundred:\n\n- 4's: 10 times (440-449)\n- 8's: 9 times (480-488)\n\nSo, total tens place occurrences:\n- 4's: 4*10 (from full hundreds) + 10 (partial) = 50\n- 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times, which means 4's have 1 more occurrence here.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. \n\nSo, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So, in the hundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89 times\n- 8's: 0 times\n\nSo, that's a big difference here. 4's have 89 more in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences:\n\n- Units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49\n- Tens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 49\n- Hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units place: 49 each. Tens place: 50 for 4's and 49 for 8's. Hundreds place: 89 for 4's and 0 for 8's.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a lot. Maybe I made a mistake in the tens place.\n\nWait, in the tens place, for the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 times, correct. And the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page. So, that's correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4's appear from 400-488, which is 89 times. That seems right because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89.\n\nSo, adding up, yes, 4's have 188 and 8's have 98, so the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Units Place:**\n   - For every 10 consecutive numbers, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete groups of 10 in 480 pages, contributing 48 each.\n   - The remaining pages (481-488) add one more 4 and one more 8.\n   - Total: 49 each.\n\n2. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contains 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n   - Four full hundreds contribute 40 each.\n   - The last partial hundred (401-488) adds 10 for 4 and 9 for 8.\n   - Total: 50 for 4, 49 for 8.\n\n3. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Hundreds Place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\n4. **Summing Up:**\n   - Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - Total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI remember that to count the number of times a specific digit appears, I can analyze each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. So, I'll need to check how many times the digit 4 appears in the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place, and do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4. I'll go through each place one by one.\n\nFirst, the units place. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. So in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. \n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 pages (since 48*10=480, and 488-480=8). \n\nIn each complete block, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. The digit 4 appears once here as well (page 484). So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for pages 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, in 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10 times, and so on.\n\nTo find how many complete hundreds are in 488, we can divide 488 by 100, which gives 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds and a partial hundred. \n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages, so that's 4*10=40 times. Now, the partial hundred is 401-488. Here, the tens digit is 4 for pages 440-449, which is 10 pages, and then from 450-488, the tens digit goes from 5 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear again in the tens place. So, in the partial hundred, we have another 10 times. \n\nWait, but 488 is less than 500, so the partial hundred is 401-488. So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 pages, and then in 450-488, the tens digit is 5,6,7,8, so no more 4's in the tens place. So, total 4's in the tens place are 4*10 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, hold on, that might not be right. Let me think again. The first 400 pages would be up to page 400, right? So, from 1-400, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50 times. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is another 10 times, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 more. But wait, 401-488 is 88 pages, so 440-449 is within that. So, total 4's in the tens place would be 50 (from 1-400) plus 10 (from 401-488), totaling 60? Wait, no, that can't be right because 440-449 is part of the 400-499 range, which is the fifth hundred. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet me approach it differently. For the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? For each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Now, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then the partial hundred from 401-488.\n\nIn each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages each, so that's 4*10=40 times. Now, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for pages 440-449, which is another 10 times. So, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400 to 488, right? So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So, 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Again, in each block of 10, the digit 8 appears once. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488? 48 complete blocks, as before, and a partial block of 8 pages.\n\nIn each complete block, 8 appears once, so 48 times. In the partial block (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once (page 488). So, total 8's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, for each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 pages. Now, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds, as before, and a partial hundred from 401-488.\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 pages, so 4*10=40 times. Now, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages here.\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait: in the partial hundred, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So, yes, 9 times.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is never 8. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, 49 + 49 is 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 4 again. I had 50 times. Let me recount:\n\nIn the tens place, for 4's:\n- 1-100: 40-49 \u2192 10\n- 101-200: 140-149 \u2192 10\n- 201-300: 240-249 \u2192 10\n- 301-400: 340-349 \u2192 10\n- 401-488: 440-449 \u2192 10\nSo, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place:\n- 1-100: 80-89 \u2192 10\n- 101-200: 180-189 \u2192 10\n- 201-300: 280-289 \u2192 10\n- 301-400: 380-389 \u2192 10\n- 401-488: 480-488 \u2192 9\nSo, 4*10 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nUnits place for both digits:\n- 4's: 49\n- 8's: 49\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's: 89 (from 400-488)\n- 8's: 0\n\nSo, yes, 188 - 98 = 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** In every block of 10 pages, 4 appears once. There are 48 complete blocks (480 pages) and a partial block of 8 pages. Thus, 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n   - **Tens place:** In every block of 100 pages, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. There are 4 complete blocks (400 pages) and a partial block where 4 appears 10 times (440-449). Thus, 4*10 + 10 = 50 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears once every 10 pages, totaling 49 times.\n   - **Tens place:** In every 100 pages, 8 appears 10 times. In the partial block, it appears 9 times (480-488). Thus, 4*10 + 9 = 49 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 8 never appears as the hundreds digit since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 appears 90 times more than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, I'll need to analyze each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears and how many times 8 appears. For the units digit, every 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once. So, for example, in 1-10, 4 appears once (at 4), and 8 appears once (at 8). This pattern continues up to 480, which is 48 sets of 10. So, the number of 4's in the units place would be 48, and the same for 8's. But wait, the last page is 488, which is beyond 480. So, from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8. In this range, 484 has a 4 in the units place, and 488 has an 8. So, that adds one more 4 and one more 8. Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, looking at the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 ten times (40-49), and 8 ten times (80-89). So, in each block of 100, there are 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place. Since the book has 488 pages, there are four full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, actually, that's four full hundreds (1-400) and then 401-488. So, for the tens place, in each hundred, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times. So, for four hundreds, that's 4*10=40 for both 4 and 8. Now, looking at the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, in this range, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 for 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481,...,488), but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times in 440-449, and 8 appears 9 times in 480-488. So, adding to the previous 40, the total for 4's in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50, and for 8's, it's 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit only goes up to 4. Therefore, the number of 4's in the hundreds place is 89, and 8's are 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences. For 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the total 8's from the total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place:\n- Each 10 numbers: 1 each of 4 and 8. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, plus the last 8 pages (481-488). In 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, 48*1 +1 = 49 for both, correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred, 10 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place. 4 hundreds (1-400), so 4*10=40 each. Then 401-488: tens digits go from 0 to 8. For 4 in tens place: 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. For 8 in tens place: 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488 inclusive), so 9 times. So, total 4's tens: 40 +10=50, 8's tens:40+9=49.

Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89 = 188\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488.\n\nI guess I should start by counting how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me think about how to count the occurrences of a specific digit in each position. Page numbers can be broken down into units, tens, and hundreds places. So, for each digit (4 and 8), I need to calculate how many times it appears in the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nStarting with the digit 4. I'll consider each position separately.\n\nFirst, the units place. Every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in every set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1 to 10, it's page 4; from 11 to 20, it's page 14, and so on.\n\nTo find out how many times 4 appears in the units place up to 488, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives me 48 full groups of 10, and then check the remaining 8 numbers (since 488 is 48*10 + 8). Each full group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits are 1 through 8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So, total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, it appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, it's 40-49; that's 10 times.\n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each of the 4 full hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so that's 4*10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 again. Let's see, the tens digit is 4 in the range 440-449, which is 10 times. Wait, but 488 is only up to 488, so 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So that's another 10 times. So, total 4's in the tens place would be 40 + 10 = 50 times.\n\nWait, but wait, 488 is 488, so 401-488 is 88 pages. The tens digit in 401-488 goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but since we stop at 488, it's only up to 488). So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 10 times. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers, meaning 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but actually, when considering the hundreds place, each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in all positions: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 4 appears 187 times.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nDivide 488 by 10: 48 full groups, with 8 remaining. Each group contributes one 8, so 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once (at 488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. In each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for the first 400 pages, we have 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40 times.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles again. The tens digit 8 occurs in the range 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, let me check: 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the remaining 88 pages.\n\nWait, but actually, from 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 480-489, but since we stop at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 40 (from the first 400) + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier I thought 4's appeared 187 times, which is way more than 8's. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, for the 8's in the tens place: from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 times, right? Because 480, 481, ..., 488 is 9 numbers, each with tens digit 8. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but wait, 480 is included in 401-488, right? So, yes, that's 9 times.\n\nSo, 40 from the first 400 pages, plus 9 in the remaining, so 49 in the tens place.\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus the last 8 numbers (481-488) where 8 appears once (at 488). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but that's 98, but 4's were 187. So, the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, that seems a lot, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's. Units place: 48, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 is 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. So, 49 more 4's than 8's? Wait, no, 187 - 98 is 89. So, 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check again because 89 seems a large number, but maybe it's correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, which is a big chunk, while 8 doesn't appear there at all. So, that's already a difference of 89. Then, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, while 8 appears 49 times, so that's a difference of +1. In the units place, both appear 48 times, but 4 has an extra one in the units place? Wait, no, 4's units were 48, 8's units were 49. Wait, so 4's units are 48, 8's units are 49. So, 4 is actually one less in the units place.\n\nWait, so let me recast the total counts:\n\n4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total: 187.\n\n8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total: 98.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89. So, 4's appear 89 times more than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. For 4's, units place: from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear? Every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full times, and then in the last partial set (481-488), 488 is the 8th number, so units digits are 1-8, so 4 doesn't appear. So, units place 4's: 48.\n\nFor 8's, units place: same as above, 48 full times, and in the last 8 numbers, 488 has units digit 8, so that's one more. So, units place 8's: 49.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place for 4's: 4 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, 10 times each. So, 4 full hundreds, 10 each, so 40, plus in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nFor 8's, tens place: in the first 400 pages, 40 times, as each hundred contributes 10. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times, so 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, yes, the counts are correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought 8's would be more, but maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nWait, 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times, which is a lot, so that's why the total is higher for 4's. 8's don't appear in the hundreds place, so they can't catch up.\n\nSo, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. For 488 pages, there are 48 full groups of 10, contributing 48 times. The last 8 numbers (481-488) don't include a 4 in the units place. Total: 48.\n   - **Tens Place:** Every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For 400 pages, that's 40 times. In the remaining 88 pages (401-488), 4 appears in 440-449 (10 times). Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Total: 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n2. **Counting Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** Every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. For 488 pages, 48 times. The last 8 numbers include 488, adding 1 more. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** Every 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times. For 400 pages, that's 40 times. In the remaining 88 pages, 8 appears in 480-488 (9 times). Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488. Total: 0.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI remember that to count how many times a particular digit appears, I can look at each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds, and so on. So, I should probably analyze the occurrence of the digit 4 and the digit 8 in each place (units, tens, hundreds) from 1 to 488.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For each digit, the occurrence in the units place repeats every 10 numbers. For example, in the numbers 1-10, the digit 4 appears once (at 4), and the digit 8 appears once (at 8). This pattern continues every 10 numbers. So, for the units place, I can calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then seeing how many full groups of 10 there are. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10 and then an extra 8 numbers (481-488). \n\nWait, actually, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each digit, the number of times it appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete tens multiplied by 1 (since each group of 10 has one 4 and one 8 in the units place) plus any extra occurrences in the incomplete group. \n\nSo, let's calculate for the units place first. The number of complete tens is 48 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens). Therefore, the digit 4 appears 48 times in the units place, and the digit 8 appears 48 times as well. Now, we need to check the incomplete group, which is from 481 to 488. The units digits here are 1 through 8. So, in this incomplete group, does 4 or 8 appear in the units place? Yes, 484 has a 4 in the units place, and 488 has an 8. So, that adds one more 4 and one more 8. \n\nWait, no. Let me correct that. The incomplete group is from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, the units digits are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Therefore, in this group, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, adding these to the previous counts, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's, which is also 49. So, in the units place, both digits appear the same number of times.\n\nNext, I should look at the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers: 40-49, and similarly, 8 appears in 80-89, which is also 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. \n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an additional 88 numbers (401-488). \n\nSo, for each of these 4 full hundreds, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49 in each hundred), and the same for 8 (e.g., 80-89). Therefore, in the tens place, each digit appears 4 * 10 = 40 times. \n\nNow, let's check the incomplete hundred: 401-488. The tens digit in this range goes from 0 to 8. So, for the tens place, we need to see how many times 4 and 8 appear. \n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits cycle as follows: 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears once for each hundred, but in the incomplete hundred, does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see: the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is part of 401-488. So, that's 10 numbers: 440-449. Therefore, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in the incomplete hundred. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480-488. Wait, no. 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so the tens digit is 8 for all these, so 9 times. Wait, but 480 is part of 480-489, but since we stop at 488, it's 9 numbers. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the incomplete hundred. \n\nWait, let me confirm. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, when the tens digit is 4, that's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. When the tens digit is 8, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times, and the digit 8 appears 9 times in the incomplete hundred. \n\nTherefore, in the tens place overall, the digit 4 appears 4*10 + 10 = 50 times, and the digit 8 appears 4*10 + 9 = 49 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times. \n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, from 1-99, there is no hundreds digit. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4. \n\nSo, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). Therefore, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8, on the other hand, never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is either 1, 2, 3, or 4. Therefore, the digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place at all. \n\nSo, summarizing the hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's add up the occurrences for each digit across all places.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal for 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal for 8: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's are printed than 8's, we subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n- Each full ten contributes 1 occurrence for each digit, so 48 full tens give 48 each.\n- The incomplete group (481-488) adds 1 each, so total units: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each full hundred contributes 10 occurrences for each digit, so 4 full hundreds give 4*10=40 each.\n- In the incomplete hundred (401-488), 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total tens: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8. That adds up.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488), which is correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n- 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place, so 0. That's correct.\n\nAdding them up:\n- 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n- 8: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When counting the units place, I considered 488 as the last page. So, from 1 to 488, inclusive. So, when I divided 488 by 10, I got 48.8, meaning 48 full tens and an extra 8 numbers. But in the units place, from 1 to 488, the number of times each digit appears in the units place is calculated as follows: for each digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place is floor(488 / 10) + (1 if d <= (488 % 10) else 0). Wait, no, that's not quite right. The formula is a bit different.\n\nActually, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is equal to (n // 10) + (1 if d <= (n % 10) else 0). Wait, no, that's not quite accurate. Let me think again.\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is equal to the number of complete groups of 10, which is n // 10, plus 1 if d is less than or equal to the remainder when n is divided by 10. But since we're counting from 1 to n, inclusive, if the remainder is >= d, we add 1. But wait, actually, the formula is:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is:\n= (n // 10) * (d == 0 ? 0 : 1) + (1 if d <= (n % 10) else 0)\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me correct this. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly n//10 times, and then an additional 1 if the digit is less than or equal to n%10. But since we're starting from 1, not 0, the digit 0 doesn't appear in the units place for n >=1. Wait, actually, the first page is 1, so the units digit starts at 1, not 0. So, the number of times digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is:\n\nIf d == 0: 0 (since we don't have page 0)\nElse: (n // 10) + (1 if d <= (n % 10) else 0)\n\nWait, no, that's not correct either because when n is, say, 12, n//10 is 1, and n%10 is 2. So, for d=1, it would be 1 + (1 if 1 <= 2 else 0) = 2. But from 1 to 12, the units digit 1 appears at 1 and 11, which is 2 times, so that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for d=2, it would be 1 + (1 if 2 <= 2 else 0) = 2. From 1 to 12, units digit 2 appears at 2 and 12, which is 2 times. Correct.\n\nSo, applying this formula to our problem where n=488.\n\nFor digit 4 in units place:\n= (488 // 10) + (1 if 4 <= (488 % 10) else 0)\n= 48 + (1 if 4 <= 8 else 0)\n= 48 + 1\n= 49\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8 in units place:\n= (488 // 10) + (1 if 8 <= 8 else 0)\n= 48 + 1\n= 49\n\nSo, that's correct. So, in the units place, both digits appear 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, the formula is a bit different. The number of times digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to n is:\n\n= (n // 100) * 10 + (min(max(n % 100 - 10 * d + 1, 0), 10) if d > 0 else 0)\n\nWait, that might be more complicated. Alternatively, for each digit d in the tens place, the number of times it appears is:\n\nFor each hundred, d appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., d0-d9). So, the number of full hundreds is n // 100, which gives the number of complete sets of 100. Each contributes 10 times. Then, for the remaining part, which is n % 100, the number of times d appears in the tens place is max(0, (n % 100) - 10*d + 1) if d <= (n % 100) // 10 else 0.\n\nWait, perhaps a simpler way is to consider that for the tens place, the digit d appears in the tens place for numbers from d*10 to (d+1)*10 -1, but adjusted for the upper limit n.\n\nSo, for digit d in the tens place, the count is:\n\ncount = 0\nfor each hundred, from 0 to (n // 100), the tens digit d appears 10 times in each hundred. So, that's (n // 100) * 10.\n\nThen, for the remaining part, which is n % 100, if the tens digit is >= d, then we add (n % 100 - d*10 + 1). If the tens digit is less than d, we add 0.\n\nWait, perhaps an example would help. Let's take n=488.\n\nFor digit 4 in the tens place:\n\nNumber of full hundreds = 488 // 100 = 4. So, 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40.\n\nNow, the remaining part is 488 % 100 = 88. So, the tens digit in the remaining part is 8 (since 88 is in the 80-89 range). Now, since 8 >=4, we add (88 - 40 +1) = 49. Wait, but that can't be right because 40-49 is 10 numbers, but we're only going up to 88. Wait, no, the remaining part is 0-88 in the tens place. Wait, no, the remaining part is from 400-488. So, the tens digit in this range goes from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, for digit 4 in the tens place, it appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, in the incomplete hundred, digit 4 appears 10 times. Therefore, total for 4 in tens place is 4*10 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8 in the tens place:\n\nNumber of full hundreds =4, contributing 4*10=40.\n\nRemaining part is 488%100=88, so the tens digit is 8. So, the digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, we add 9. Therefore, total for 8 in tens place is 40 +9=49.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place, as previously determined, digit 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and digit 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\nDigit 4:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50+89=188\n\nDigit 8:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference was 90, but I just want to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.\n\nWait, 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188 for 4.\n\n49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98 for 8.\n\n188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer is that there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is 188, while the digit 8 appears 98 times. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488.\n\nI guess I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll handle each place for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place.\n   - Since the book has 488 pages, there are 488 / 10 = 48 full blocks of 10, and then 8 extra pages (481 to 488).\n   - In each full block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 * 1 = 48 times.\n   - Now, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So the digit 4 appears once in 484.\n   - So total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 numbers.\n   - Similarly, from 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10 numbers.\n   - This pattern continues up to 400-488.\n   - Let's calculate how many full hundreds there are. 488 / 100 = 4 full hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n   - Wait, actually, 400-488 is only 89 pages, so the tens digit in the hundreds place might be different.\n   - Let me correct that. Each full hundred (like 0-99, 100-199, etc.) has 10 occurrences of the tens digit being 4.\n   - There are 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399). So 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - Now, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10.\n   - Wait, no, 400-488 includes 400-488, so the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's another 10.\n   - So total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488.\n   - From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 pages.\n   - So that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me check that. The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times. But actually, from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nSo total 4's in the hundreds place: 89.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, each full hundred contributes 10, so 4 full hundreds give 40, and then 400-488 has another 10 in 440-449, so 50 total. That seems right.\n\nIn the units place, 48 full tens blocks give 48, and the last 8 pages (481-488) include 484, so 1 more, totaling 49. That adds up.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, in each block of 10, 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 full blocks of 10, so 48 times.\n   - In the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in 488.\n   - So total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In each block of 100, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - There are 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - Now, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So that's 9 occurrences.\n   - So total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page numbers are 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8.\n   - So 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because I think I made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. So from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So that's 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSo total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but wait, in the units place, 488 is included, so that's correct. So 49 units and 49 tens, totaling 98 8's.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts.\n\nWait, 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nSo 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that's the calculation. But let me make sure I didn't overcount.\n\nWait, another approach: for each digit place, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFor 4's in units place:\n\nNumber of complete decades (groups of 10) = 488 // 10 = 48, remainder 8.\n\nSo 48 * 1 = 48, plus 1 if the remainder includes a 4. Since the last page is 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 is included once. So total 49.\n\nSimilarly for 8's in units place: 48 * 1 = 48, plus 1 in the remainder (488 has 8), so 49.\n\nTens place for 4's:\n\nNumber of complete centuries (groups of 100) = 488 // 100 = 4, remainder 88.\n\nIn each complete century, 4's in tens place: 10 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nIn the remainder (0-88), the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So total 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nFor 8's in tens place:\n\nEach complete century contributes 10 times (80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nIn the remainder (0-88), the tens digit is 8 for 80-88, which is 9 numbers. So 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place for 4's:\n\nIn 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\nFor 8's in hundreds place: since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so 0.\n\nSo adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again.\n\nFrom 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place for 4's, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nSo the total 4's are 188, and 8's are 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe using a formula for digit frequency.\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N is:\n\nunits = (N // 10) + 1 if N % 10 >= d else (N // 10)\n\nSimilarly, for tens place:\n\ntens = (N // 100) * 10 + min(max(N % 100 - d*10 + 1, 0), 10)\n\nAnd for hundreds place:\n\nhundreds = (N // 1000) * 100 + min(max(N % 1000 - d*100 + 1, 0), 100)\n\nBut since N is 488, which is less than 1000, the hundreds place for 4's is 400-488, which is 89.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to stick with my initial method.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to compute the number of 4's and 8's again.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\nUnits place:\n- Each 10 pages, 4 appears once. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48.\n- The last partial ten is 481-488, which includes 484, so 1 more. Total 49.\n\nTens place:\n- Each 100 pages, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40.\n- The last partial hundred is 400-488. In the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So total 50.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\nUnits place:\n- Each 10 pages, 8 appears once. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48.\n- The last partial ten is 481-488, which includes 488, so 1 more. Total 49.\n\nTens place:\n- Each 100 pages, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40.\n- The last partial hundred is 400-488. In the tens place, 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times (since 488 is the end). So total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, so the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? It's every number from 400 to 488, which is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place for 4's, in each hundred, 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contribute 10, so 4 * 10 = 40, plus 10 in 440-449, making 50.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 49.\n\nSo total 4's: 188.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 49, tens place: 49, so total 98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can list the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits:\n- Pages ending with 4: 4,14,24,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, step 10. So (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49.\n\nTens:\n- Pages where tens digit is 4: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block of 100 has 10 such pages. There are 4 full hundreds, so 4*10=40. Then in 400-488, 440-449 is 10 pages. So total 40 +10=50.\n\nHundreds:\n- Pages where hundreds digit is 4: 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits:\n- Pages ending with 8:8,18,28,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10. (488 -8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49.\n\nTens:\n- Pages where tens digit is 8:80-89,180-189,...,480-488. Each block of 100 has 10, so 4*10=40. Then in 400-488, 480-488 is 9 pages (since 488 is included). So total 40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds:\n- No pages have hundreds digit 8.\n\nTotal 8's:49 +49=98.\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nSo the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488.\n\nI guess the best way to approach this is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each block of 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra numbers.\n\nIn each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for the digit 8. So, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 times 1, which is 48, plus any additional 4's in the remaining 8 numbers. Wait, but in the remaining numbers from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so there's a 4 in 484. So that adds one more 4, making it 49. Similarly, for 8's, in the remaining numbers, 488 is the last page, so the units digit is 8, which is another 8. So, 48 complete blocks give 48 8's, plus 1 more in 488, totaling 49 8's in the units place.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me correct that. The remaining numbers after 480 are 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers. So for the units place, the digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). So the total for units place is 48 (from the blocks) plus 1 for 4's, making 49, and 48 plus 1 for 8's, making 49 as well. Hmm, so both 4's and 8's appear 49 times in the units place. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here because 488 is the last page, so in the units place, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear?\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position separately.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor the digit 4 in the units place: It appears once every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nNumber of complete tens: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete tens. Each contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484). So total 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place: Same calculation. 48 complete tens, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. In the remaining 8 numbers, 488 is included, so units digit 8 appears once. So 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nSo both 4's and 8's appear 49 times in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in each block of 100 numbers. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488).\n\nSo, for each of the 4 hundreds, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 4 times 10 is 40. Then, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? From 440-449, which is 10 times. So total for 4 in tens place is 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place: In each full hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4 times 10 is 40. In the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes up to 8, so 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. Wait, actually, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers. So that's 9 times. So total for 8 in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for the tens digit 8, it's from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So total for 8 in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, 4's in tens place: 50, 8's in tens place: 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, each digit from 1 to 4 appears 100 times each, except for the last partial hundred if any. Wait, but in this case, the book has 488 pages, so the hundreds digit goes from 1 (for 1-99), 2 (100-199), 3 (200-299), 4 (300-399), and then 400-488, where the hundreds digit is 4.\n\nSo, for the digit 4 in the hundreds place: It appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times.\n\nFor the digit 8 in the hundreds place: Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, 4's in hundreds place: 89, 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the totals for each digit.\n\nTotal 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nTotal 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's, so subtract the total 8's from the total 4's.\n\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- 4's: 48 complete tens (48) + 1 in the last partial (484) = 49\n- 8's: 48 complete tens (48) + 1 in the last partial (488) = 49\n\nTens place:\n- 4's: 4 full hundreds (40 each) + 10 in the partial (440-449) = 50\n- 8's: 4 full hundreds (40 each) + 9 in the partial (480-488) = 49\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's: 89 (400-488)\n- 8's: 0\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **4's:** Appear once every 10 numbers.

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI guess I'll start by looking at how often the digits 4 and 8 appear in each place: units, tens, and hundreds. Let's tackle each digit position separately.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every ten consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles through 0 to 9. So, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once every ten numbers. Therefore, the number of times 4 appears in the units place up to page 488 should be the total number of complete groups of ten times 1 (since each group has one 4). Similarly, the same logic applies to 8.\n\nWait, but I need to consider the total number of pages. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of ten and then 8 extra pages. In each complete group, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for 48 groups, that's 48 times each. Now, the remaining 8 pages are from 481 to 488. Let's check the units digits here: 481 ends with 1, 482 with 2, up to 488 ending with 8. So, in the units place of the remaining 8 pages, the digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). \n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 (from the complete groups) + 1 (from the remaining pages) = 49. Similarly, the number of 8's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49. So, so far, they're equal.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers. So, for example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 ten times (40-49) and 8 ten times (80-89). \n\nNow, since the book has 488 pages, let's see how many complete hundreds we have. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit is 4 exactly 10 times and 8 exactly 10 times. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10=40 for each digit. Now, let's look at the last partial hundred: 401-488. The tens digit here goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 and 8 appear?\n\nFor the tens digit being 4: the pages are 440-449. That's 10 pages, so 10 times. But wait, our range is up to 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488, so that's 10 times.\n\nFor the tens digit being 8: the pages would be 480-488. That's 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in this partial hundred.\n\nSo, adding up, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 4*10 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from the partial hundred) = 50. The number of 8's in the tens place is 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, hold on, let me make sure. From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, yes, 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. So, 50 vs 49, so 4's are more by 1 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and then 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit changes every 100 pages. So, pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (since they are two-digit numbers), 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, 200-299: 2, 300-399: 3, and 400-488: 4.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488, which is 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in hundreds place: 89, and 8's: 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate: 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, units place: 4's: 49, 8's:49. Tens place: 50 vs 49. Hundreds place: 89 vs 0. So, total 4's: 49 +50 +89= 188. 8's:49+49+0=98. Difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, another way to check: maybe I should calculate how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider each digit place separately and sum up.\n\nWait, let me think about the units place again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing 1, so 48, and then in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 484 has a 4 in the units place. So, 48 +1=49. Same for 8: 48 full cycles, each contributing 1, and in the remaining 8, 488 has an 8. So, 48+1=49. So that's correct.\n\nTens place: For the tens digit, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So, from 1-400, we have 4 complete hundreds. Each hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 for 4 and 40 for 8. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times. The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, total 4's in tens place:40+10=50, 8's:40+9=49. That's correct.\n\nHundreds place: As I thought earlier, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 89 for 4's, 0 for 8's.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but 90 seems a bit high. Let me check if I'm counting correctly.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's count the number of 4's and 8's in each position.\n\nUnits place:\n- For 4: From 1-488, how many numbers end with 4? It's every 10 numbers, so 488//10=48, and 488%10 >=4? 488 mod 10 is 8, which is greater than 4, so 48+1=49. So, 49 times.\n- For 8: Similarly, every 10 numbers, 488//10=48, and 488 mod10=8, so 48+1=49. So, 49 times.\n\nTens place:\n- For 4: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) contribute 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 40+10=50.\n- For 8: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 4 hundreds contribute 4*10=40. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n- For 4: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, the hundreds digit is 4. So, 89 times.\n- For 8: There are no pages where the hundreds digit is 8, since the book ends at 488. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding them up:\n- 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because 90 seems like a lot, but when I break it down, it makes sense. The hundreds place contributes a significant number because 4 appears 89 times there, while 8 doesn't appear at all. So, the difference is mainly due to the hundreds place.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- **4's:** Occur once every 10 numbers. There are 48 full groups of 10 in 488, contributing 48 occurrences. The remaining 8 pages (481-488) include one more 4 (484). Total: 49.\n- **8's:** Similarly, occur once every 10 numbers, totaling 49.\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- **4's:** Each hundred has 10 occurrences. Four complete hundreds (1-400) contribute 40. The partial hundred (401-488) includes 10 more (440-449). Total: 50.\n- **8's:** Each hundred has 10 occurrences, totaling 40. The partial hundred includes 9 more (480-488). Total: 49.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- **4's:** From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, occurring 89 times.\n- **8's:** Never appears in the hundreds place. Total: 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nAlright, so I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense. \n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll go through each position one by one and calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So 4 appears once (page 4) and 8 appears once (page 8). This pattern repeats every 10 pages. \n\nNow, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So there are 48 complete groups and then 8 extra pages. \n\nIn each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears once and the digit 8 appears once. So for 48 groups, that's 48 times each. Now, the remaining 8 pages are from 481 to 488. Let's check the units digits here: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So in this partial group, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). \n\nSo total for units place: 48 + 1 = 49 times for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 times for 8. Hmm, so so far, they're equal in the units place. \n\nNext, let's move to the tens place. The tens digit changes every 10 pages. For example, from 1-9, the tens digit is 0, then 10-19 it's 1, 20-29 it's 2, and so on. \n\nIn the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in each block of 100 pages. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, it appears 10 times in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, etc. Similarly, 8 in the tens place appears 10 times in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, etc.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many hundreds are in 488 pages. There are 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 pages (40-49, 140-149, etc.), so for 4 hundreds, that's 4 times 10 = 40 times. Similarly, 8 in the tens place appears 10 times per hundred, so 4 times 10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, let's check the remaining 88 pages from 401 to 488. The tens digit here goes from 0 to 8. Let's see when the tens digit is 4 and 8. \n\nFrom 401-409: tens digit is 0.\n410-419: tens digit is 1.\n420-429: tens digit is 2.\n430-439: tens digit is 3.\n440-449: tens digit is 4. That's 10 pages, so 4 appears 10 times here.\n450-459: tens digit is 5.\n460-469: tens digit is 6.\n470-479: tens digit is 7.\n480-488: tens digit is 8. That's 9 pages (480-488), so 8 appears 9 times here.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so from 480 to 488 is 9 pages, right? So in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). \n\nSo, adding this to our previous counts: 4 in tens place is 40 + 10 = 50, and 8 in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. \n\nSo now, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. That's a difference of 1 so far in favor of 4.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, 400-488 would have a hundreds digit of 4, right? \n\nWait, let me correct that. From 1-99, hundreds digit is 0 (since it's a two-digit number), but when considering page numbers, the hundreds digit is 0 for 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. \n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488. How many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit cycles every 100 pages, so 8 would be in the hundreds place from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit 8 never appears. Therefore, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding this up: 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and 8 appears 0 times. \n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences of 4 and 8 across all digit positions.\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal for 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal for 8: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the units place: 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. The remaining 8 pages (481-488) have one 4 (484) and one 8 (488), so total 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place. There are 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so 4*10=40 each. Then, in the last 88 pages (401-488), 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So 40+10=50 for 4 and 40+9=49 for 8. That's correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488) and 8 appears 0 times. So total for 4 is 89, and for 8 it's 0.\n\nAdding up: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 for 4.\n\nFor 8: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I thought maybe the hundreds place might have more, but it seems correct. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nAlright, so I guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll handle each place one by one for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's.\n\nStarting with the units place: In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's 4; in 11-20, it's 14; and so on. \n\nNow, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of ten and then a partial block of 8 pages (since 488 = 48*10 + 8). In each full block, there's one 4 in the units place. So that's 48 times. But wait, in the partial block from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 484 have a 4 in the units place? Yes, it does. So that's one more 4. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has ten numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488?\n\nStarting from 40-49: that's one block.\nThen 140-149: another.\n240-249: another.\n340-349: another.\n440-449: another.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 instances of the digit 4 in the tens place. So that's 5 * 10 = 50.\n\nBut wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. 440 is page 440, and 449 is page 449, which is indeed before 488. So yes, all five blocks are fully included. So, 50 times the digit 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 instances of the digit 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me compute that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4, in every block of ten, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, how many full blocks of ten are there in 488? 48 full blocks, as before. Each contributes one 8, so 48. Then, the partial block from 481 to 488: the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included. So, that's another 8 in the units place. So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488). So, how many full blocks do we have?\n\nFrom 80-89: that's one block, 10 numbers.\n180-189: another, 10 numbers.\n280-289: another, 10 numbers.\n380-389: another, 10 numbers.\n480-488: that's 9 numbers because 488 is the last page.\n\nSo, the first four blocks are full, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, and the last block contributes 9 8's. So, total tens place 8's are (4 * 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be for numbers from 800 to 899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems off because earlier I thought the tens place had 49, but let me double-check. So, in the tens place, each block like 80-89, 180-189, etc., contributes 10 8's. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, which is 4*10 +9=49. So yes, 49 in the tens place. Units place is 49, so total 98 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For the tens place, in each hundred, like 0-99, 100-199, etc., the tens digit cycles every 100 pages. So, in each hundred, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place, right? So, in 0-99: 80-89, that's 10. In 100-199: 180-189, another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 280-289, 10. 300-399: 380-389, 10. Then, 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 4 full hundreds contributing 10 each, and the last partial hundred contributing 9. So, 4*10 +9=49, which matches what I had before.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the hundreds place had zero 8's, which is correct because the book ends at 488, so no 800-899 pages.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me just cross-verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct. 89.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of those blocks is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus the partial block where 484 is included, so +1, total 49.\n\nSo 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus the partial block where 488 is included, so +1, total 49.\n\nTens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 4 full blocks of 10, and one partial block of 9, so 4*10 +9=49.\n\nSo, 49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in different places, it's easy to make an off-by-one error. Let me try another approach to confirm.\n\nAnother way is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor the units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10)=48, and if the remainder is >=4, add 1. Since 488%10=8, which is >=4, so 48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's: floor(488/10)=48, and since 488%10=8, which is exactly 8, so add 1, total 49.\n\nFor the tens digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100)=4, which represents the number of complete hundreds. Each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So 4*10=40. Now, check the remaining pages: 488 - (4*100)=88. So, in the tens place, how many 4's are there in 0-88? The tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so add 10. So total 4*10 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place: floor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40. Then, check the remaining 88 pages: in 0-88, the tens digit is 8 in 80-88, which is 9 numbers. So, total 4*10 +9=49.\n\nFor the hundreds digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/1000)=0, but wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nNumber of 8's: floor(488/1000)=0, and since 800-899 is beyond 488, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: units(49) + tens(50) + hundreds(89)=188.\n\n8's: units(49) + tens(49) + hundreds(0)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any errors in the calculations now.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 4.\n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 full groups, each contributing 1, totaling 48.\n   - The partial group (481-488) includes 484, adding 1 more.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers have a block (e.g., 40-49) contributing 10 4's.\n   - 488 \u00f7 100 = 4 full blocks, each contributing 10, totaling 40.\n   - The remaining 88 numbers include another block (440-449), adding 10.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 each have a 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4, every 10 numbers contribute one 8.\n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 full groups, each contributing 1, totaling 48.\n   - The partial group (481-488) includes 488, adding 1 more.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers have a block (e.g., 80-89) contributing 10 8's.\n   - 488 \u00f7 100 = 4 full blocks, each contributing 10, totaling 40.\n   - The remaining 88 numbers include another block (480-488), adding 9.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No pages have 8 in the hundreds place (800-899 exceeds 488).\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488.\n\nI guess I should start by counting how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me think about how to count the digits. I remember that for problems like this, it's helpful to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds, etc. So, I'll need to count the number of 4's and 8's in the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place across all page numbers.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the units place. For every block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. For example, from 1 to 10, the 4 is in 4 and the 8 is in 8. This pattern repeats every 10 numbers.\n\nSince the book has 488 pages, the number of complete blocks of 10 is 48 (because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks). In each of these 48 blocks, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, that's 48 times each. But wait, there's an extra 8 pages after that, from 481 to 488. So, I need to check if there are any additional 4's or 8's in the units place beyond the 48 blocks.\n\nFrom 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this range, the units digit 4 appears once (484) and the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, adding that to the previous counts, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the 8's are also 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that can't be right because 488 is included, so maybe I need to adjust.\n\nWait, no, actually, the 48 blocks of 10 go up to page 480. Then pages 481 to 488 are 8 more pages. So, in the units place, from 1 to 480, there are 48 4's and 48 8's. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in this range, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, the total units place counts would be 48 + 1 = 49 for 4's and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8's. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The first 480 pages have 48 blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 each. Then, pages 481-488: 484 has a 4 in the units place, and 488 has an 8. So, that adds one more 4 and one more 8. So, total units place: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nWait, but 488 is page 488, so the units digit is 8, so yes, that's correct. So, units place: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, the digit changes every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-99, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers, but in the case of two-digit numbers, the tens digit is the first digit. Wait, maybe I should think of it as each hundred block having 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n\nWait, actually, for the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in each hundred. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. So, for each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSince the book has 488 pages, that's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nSo, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8. So, in 400 pages, that's 4 hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490). Wait, but 488 is the last page, so from 481-488, the tens digit is 8, but only for 8 pages (481-488). Wait, no, 481-490 would have tens digit 8, but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 pages with tens digit 8. So, in the tens place, from 401-488, how many times does 4 and 8 appear?\n\nWait, from 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, ..., up to 8 for 481-490. But since we only go up to 488, the last group is 481-488, which is 8 pages.\n\nSo, in the tens place, from 401-488, the digit 4 appears in the tens place when the tens digit is 4, which would be from 440-449. That's 10 pages, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 pages (480-488). Wait, but 480 is included in the 400-499 range, so from 480-488, that's 9 pages. Wait, but 480 is page 480, which is included in the 401-488 range, right? Wait, no, 401-488 is from 401 to 488, so 480 is within that range. So, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but 480 is page 480, which is included, so that's 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place from 480-488.\n\nWait, but let me check: 480 is page 480, and 488 is the last page. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place from 401-488.\n\nSo, in the tens place, from 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n\nTherefore, total tens place counts:\n\nFor 4's: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 10 from 440-449, totaling 50.\n\nFor 8's: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49.\n\nWait, but wait, is that correct? Because in the first 400 pages, each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 40 each. Then, in 401-488, we have 10 4's in the tens place (440-449) and 9 8's in the tens place (480-488). So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if the 480-488 range is correctly accounted for. Let me think again: from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. So, yes, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive). So, that's 89 times the digit 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nThe digit 8 in the hundreds place would be for pages 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, hundreds place counts:\n\n4's: 89\n\n8's: 0\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, that seems off because 188 - 98 = 90, but I feel like maybe I made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me double-check each part.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFrom 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, units place 8's: same logic. 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last group, 488 has an 8, so 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40 for both 4 and 8.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times. Tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50. Tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 times (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488. So, 89 4's and 0 8's. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me just make sure I didn't overcount anywhere.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is to count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a formula or a more systematic approach.\n\nFor each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nLet's start with the units place:\n\nNumber of 4's in units place:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: floor(488 / 10) = 48. Each contributes one 4, so 48.\n\nRemaining pages: 488 - (48 * 10) = 488 - 480 = 8 pages. In these 8 pages (481-488), how many 4's? The units digit cycles from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, units place 8's: same calculation, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 100: floor(488 / 100) = 4. Each group contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 = 40 each.\n\nRemaining pages: 488 - (4 * 100) = 88 pages. In these 88 pages (401-488), how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nFor 4 in the tens place: the tens digit is 4 when the page numbers are from 440-449. That's 10 pages, so 10 times.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place: the tens digit is 8 when the page numbers are from 480-488. That's 9 pages (since 488 is the last page), so 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nTotal tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 1000: floor(488 / 1000) = 0. So, no contribution from higher places.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400-488. That's 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\n8 in the hundreds place: none, since 488 < 800.\n\nSo, hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\nHundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nNow, summing up:\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nBut let me just think if there's another way to approach this, maybe by writing out all possible digits or using a different counting method.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about each digit place separately and calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each.\n\nFor units place:\n\nAs before, 488 pages. The number of 4's is floor(488 / 10) + (if the remainder is >= 4, add 1). Wait, no, that's not exactly right. It's better to think as:\n\nNumber of 4's in units place = (488 // 10) + (1 if (488 % 10) >= 4 else 0) - but actually, that's not the exact formula because 4 can appear multiple times in the remainder.\n\nWait, no, that approach might not be correct. Let me think again.\n\nActually, for the units digit, each digit from 0-9 appears equally often in the units place, except possibly the last partial block.\n\nSo, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place is:\n\nnumber_of_complete_groups = total_pages // 10\n\nremainder = total_pages % 10\n\ncount = number_of_complete_groups\n\nif d <= remainder:\n    count += 1\n\nSo, for d=4:\n\nnumber_of_complete_groups = 488 // 10 = 48\n\nremainder = 488 % 10 = 8\n\nsince 4 <= 8, count = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly for d=8:\n\nnumber_of_complete_groups = 48\n\nremainder = 8\n\nsince 8 <= 8, count = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nFor the tens place, the formula is similar but with groups of 100.\n\nnumber_of_complete_groups = total_pages // 100\n\nremainder = total_pages % 100\n\nFor each group, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, for d=4 in tens place:\n\ncount = number_of_complete_groups * 10\n\nthen, in the remainder, the tens digit is d if the tens digit is >= d, but actually, it's better to think:\n\nIn the remainder part (0 to remainder), how many times does the tens digit equal d.\n\nSo, for example, if the remainder is 88, then the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8.\n\nSo, for d=4, how many times does the tens digit equal 4 in the remainder 0-88?\n\nThe tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers, but since the remainder is 88, the maximum is 88, so 40-49 is fully included. So, 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8, the tens digit is 8 in 80-88, which is 9 numbers (80-88 inclusive).\n\nSo, for d=4:\n\ncount = 4 * 10 + 10 = 50\n\nfor d=8:\n\ncount = 4 * 10 + 9 = 49\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation.\n\nFor the hundreds place, it's similar but with groups of 1000.\n\nnumber_of_complete_groups = 488 // 1000 = 0\n\nremainder = 488\n\nFor d=4, the hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nFor d=8, it's 0 since 488 < 800.\n\nSo, hundreds place 4's: 89\n\n8's: 0\n\nThus, adding up, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. By examining each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately, we determine that the digit 4 appears 188 times, while the digit 8 appears 98 times. The difference is 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total complete groups of 10 in 488 pages: 48 groups.\n   - 4's: 48 occurrences + 1 (from 484) = 49.\n   - 8's: 48 occurrences + 1 (from 488) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Total complete groups of 100 in 488 pages: 4 groups.\n   - 4's: 4\u00d710 = 40 + 10 (from 440-449) = 50.\n   - 8's: 4\u00d710 = 40 + 9 (from 480-488) = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n   - 4's: 89.\n   - 8's: 0, as there are no pages 800-899.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
