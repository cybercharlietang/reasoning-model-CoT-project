    "text": " Wait, actually, since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488, so the page numbers can be 1-digit (1-9), 2-digit (10-99), or 3-digit (100-488). \n\nI think the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every set of ten numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's 4; in 11-20, it's 14; and so on. So, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra numbers. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times. But wait, I also need to consider the extra 8 numbers, which are 481 to 488. In these, the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for a block of ten numbers, like 40-49. Each such block contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see, from 1-99, there's one block (40-49). From 100-199, another block (140-149), and so on. Let's calculate how many hundreds we have. Since the book goes up to 488, we have the 400-488 range. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears in 400-488, but for the tens place, we're only concerned with the tens digit. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers. How many hundreds are there? From 1-488, that's four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. Wait, no, actually, 400-488 is part of the 400s, so that's the fifth hundred. Wait, no, 1-100 is the first hundred, 101-200 the second, 201-300 the third, 301-400 the fourth, and 401-488 is part of the fifth hundred, but only up to 488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears exactly 10 times. So that's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, in the fifth hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 488 is less than 500, so 440-449 is fully included. So, that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's would be 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but hold on, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, total tens place 4's: 40 (from first four hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because from 1-488, the hundreds are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (e.g., 40-49 in 1-100, 140-149 in 101-200, etc.), so that's 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is another 10, so total 50. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but wait, actually, in the hundreds place, each number from 400-488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's correct: 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, no, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, 99 + 89 is 188? Let me check: 99 + 89. 90 + 80 is 170, 9 + 9 is 18, so 170 + 18 = 188. Hmm, that seems high. Let me double-check each part.\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last partial ten (481-488), which is 8 numbers, the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, total units 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: In each hundred, 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributes 10. So, four hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, 440-449 is another 10. So, 40 + 10 = 50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in each digit place.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4's, every ten numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, how many complete tens are there in 488? 48 complete tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial ten (481-488), which is 8 numbers, the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, total units 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each such block contributes 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488?\n\nFrom 1-100: 80-89 is one block, contributing 10.\nFrom 101-200: 180-189, another 10.\nFrom 201-300: 280-289, another 10.\nFrom 301-400: 380-389, another 10.\nFrom 401-488: 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 each contribute 10, so that's 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the next block would be 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, let me confirm. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds: 0. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the units place 8's were 49, same as 4's. But let me check again.\n\nUnits place for 8's: Each ten numbers contribute one 8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8: 48. Then, in the last partial ten (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nTens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 10 each: 40. Then, in 401-488, 480-488 contributes 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 188 and 8's were 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But let me double-check because that seems like a big difference.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's. Units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct.\n\n8's: units: 49, tens: 49, hundreds: 0. Total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly for the hundreds place in 4's? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: For the hundreds digit, 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. For the tens digit, 4 appears in each block of ten where the tens digit is 4, which is 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but in 400-488, 440-449 is within that range, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50, but wait, from 1-488, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, that's five blocks, each contributing 10, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 4 blocks before 400, plus 10 in 440-449, making 50. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the units digit, every ten numbers have one 4, so 48 full tens, plus one in the last partial ten, making 49.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's, units: 49, tens: 49, hundreds: 0, so 98.\n\nThus, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because I feel like the difference might be smaller. Let me check another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place more carefully.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nUnits place:\n- From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n- Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place.\n- Number of complete decades: floor(488 / 10) = 48. So, 48 times.\n- The remaining numbers: 488 - (48 \u00d7 10) = 8 numbers (481-488).\n- In these 8 numbers, 484 has a units digit of 4, so that's one more.\n- Total units 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n- 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n- Each such block has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place.\n- How many such blocks are there up to 488?\n- From 1-100: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers.\n- From 101-200: 140-149 \u2192 10.\n- From 201-300: 240-249 \u2192 10.\n- From 301-400: 340-349 \u2192 10.\n- From 401-488: 440-449 \u2192 10.\n- So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488.\n- That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.\n- So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\nUnits place:\n- Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place.\n- Number of complete decades: floor(488 / 10) = 48.\n- Remaining numbers: 488 - (48 \u00d7 10) = 8.\n- In 481-488, the units digit 8 appears once (488).\n- So, total units 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n- 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n- Each block contributes 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place.\n- How many such blocks up to 488?\n- From 1-100: 80-89 \u2192 10.\n- From 101-200: 180-189 \u2192 10.\n- From 201-300: 280-289 \u2192 10.\n- From 301-400: 380-389 \u2192 10.\n- From 401-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 numbers (since 488 is the end).\n- So, total tens 8's: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so no 8's in the hundreds place.\n- So, 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 = 98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When counting the tens place for 8's, in the 480-488 range, does that include 480-489? But since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? So, 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, that's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, 9 8's there, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, in 440-449, that's 10 numbers, all within 488, so 10 4's there.\n\nI think my counts are correct. So, the difference is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems right because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the total number of digits printed. Wait, but that might complicate things. I think my initial approach is solid.\n\nSo, final answer: 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** For every 10 numbers, '4' appears once in the units place. There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 '4's. The last partial set (481-488) includes one more '4' (484). Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** '4' appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block contributes 10 '4's. There are five such blocks up to 449, contributing 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 '4's.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** '4' appears in the hundreds place for all numbers 400-488, totaling 89 '4's.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to '4's, '8' appears once every 10 numbers, contributing 48 '8's. The last partial set includes one more '8' (488). Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** '8' appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block contributes 10 '8's. There are four full blocks and a partial block (480-488) contributing 9 '8's. Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers with '8' in the hundreds place (800-899 exceeds 488). Total: 0.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of '8's from '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe digit '4' appears 90 more times than the digit '8' in the page numbers.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think about the different cases where the digits 4 and 8 appear.\n\nMaybe I should start by considering each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That way, I can count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each position and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears once (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for 8. So, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets and an extra 8 pages. So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 times, and 8 also appears 48 times. But wait, in the extra 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, in these, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, adding that, units place gives 49 fours and 49 eights. Hmm, but wait, that might not be right because 488 is the last page. Let me check: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (1-480) and then 481-488. So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 times plus once in 484, making it 49. Similarly, 8 appears 48 times plus once in 488, so 49 eights. So, units place: 49 fours, 49 eights.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. In each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (40-49), and the same for 8 (80-89). So, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 4 full hundreds (1-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears 4 times 10 = 40 times, and 8 appears 4 times 10 = 40 times. But wait, in the last 88 pages, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in the 400s, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So, in the 400s, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 10 times (480-489). But since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 appears only 9 times (480-488), because 489 isn't included. Wait, no, 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 pages, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 40 times (from the first 400 pages) plus 10 times in 440-449, making it 50 times. Wait, no, the first 400 pages would have 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit in 440-449 is another 10 fours, so total 50 fours. For eights, in the first 400 pages, 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 eights, so 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488), so 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me make sure. From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40 each. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in the 400s, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 fours. The tens digit 8 is in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 9 pages (480-488), so 9 eights. Therefore, total fours in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. Eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nOkay, so tens place: 50 fours, 49 eights.\n\nNow, onto the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this book. So, for the hundreds digit, 4 appears only in the numbers 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 fours. The hundreds digit 8 never appears because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488, and 1, 2, 3 in the earlier pages. So, eights in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, hundreds place: 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor fours:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal fours = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor eights:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal eights = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 488 pages, so units digit cycles 48 full times (1-480), each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 each. Then, from 481-488, units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units: 48 +1=49 fours, 48 +1=49 eights. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40 each. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit in the 440s is another 10 fours, so 40 +10=50 fours. For eights, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 eights. So, eights in tens place: 40 +9=49. That seems right.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, so 89 numbers where hundreds digit is 4, so 89 fours. Eights in hundreds place: 0, since the book doesn't go beyond 488.\n\nSo, total fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)= 188.\n\nTotal eights:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the units place. Let me check again. From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 pages: 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many terms? The last term is 484, which is 4 + (n-1)*10=484. So, (484-4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Similarly, 8 in units place:8,18,...,488. Last term is 488, so (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place is correct.\n\nTens place: For fours, in each hundred, 10 times. So, 4 hundreds (1-400), so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So, total 50 fours. For eights, in each hundred, 10 times, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page), so 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place:40+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: Only 400-488 have hundreds digit 4, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. No eights in hundreds place.\n\nSo, total fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal eights:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because 488 is included, so when counting the hundreds place, it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, that's correct.\n\nI think my calculations are correct, so the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- 4 appears 49 times (once every 10 pages, plus once in 484).\n- 8 appears 49 times (once every 10 pages, plus once in 488).\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- 4 appears 50 times (40 times in the first 400 pages and 10 times in 440-449).\n- 8 appears 49 times (40 times in the first 400 pages and 9 times in 480-488).\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- 4 appears 89 times (pages 400-488).\n- 8 appears 0 times.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears, then subtract the two to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each place and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 appears once. Now, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, there are 48 full groups and then an extra 8 pages (481 to 488). In each of the 48 full groups, the units digit 4 appears 48 times, and the same goes for 8. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1 through 8. So, in this extra partial group, the units digit 4 appears once (at 484), and the units digit 8 appears once (at 488). So, total units place 4's: 48*1 +1=49, and units place 8's:48*1 +1=49. Wait, that's the same, so the difference here is zero.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (40-49), and the same for 8 (80-89). Now, since the book has 488 pages, that's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an additional 88 pages (401-488). In each of the 4 hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4*10=40 times, and similarly for 8, 4*10=40 times. Now, looking at the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in this partial hundred, the tens digit 4 appears once (440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers, so the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. Wait, no, 401-488 includes 401-488, so the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 times. Similarly, 480-488 is part of the 8's in the tens place, but wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. Wait, but actually, 480 is page 480, so 480-488 is 9 pages, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in this partial hundred. Wait, but I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.\n\nIn the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, for each ten, like 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, tens digit 1; and so on up to 481-488, where the tens digit is 8. Now, in each of these tens, how many times does the digit 4 appear in the tens place? Only in the 440-449 range, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place, it's in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers (480-488). So, in the tens place, in the last partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 4 full hundreds *10 each =40, plus 10 in the partial hundred, so 50.\n\nTotal tens place 8's: 4 full hundreds *10 each=40, plus 9 in the partial hundred, so 49.\n\nSo, the difference in the tens place is 50 (4's) -49 (8's)=1.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case. Since the book has 488 pages, the hundreds digit goes from 0 (for pages 1-99) to 4 (for pages 400-488). Now, let's count how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place and how many times 8 appears.\n\nFirst, 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488. That's 89 pages (400-488 inclusive). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers.\n\nNow, does 8 ever appear in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would be pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, the count for 8's in the hundreds place is zero.\n\nSo, total hundreds place 4's:89, and 8's:0. So, the difference here is 89-0=89.\n\nNow, let's sum up the differences from each place:\n\nUnits place: 0 (4's) -0 (8's)\n\nTens place: +1 (4's have one more)\n\nHundreds place: +89 (4's have 89 more)\n\nSo, total difference is 0 +1 +89=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 49 4's and 49 8's, so difference zero. In the tens place, I had 50 4's and 49 8's, so difference +1. In the hundreds place, 89 4's and 0 8's, so difference +89. So total is 90. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me verify the counts again.\n\nUnits place:\n\nEach full group of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. There are 48 full groups (since 488/10=48.8), so 48*1=48 for each digit. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units 4's:48+1=49, units 8's:48+1=49. So, correct, difference zero.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach full hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so 4*10=40 for each digit. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. The tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page. So, tens 4's:40+10=50, tens 8's:40+9=49. So, difference +1.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488. So, hundreds 4's:89, hundreds 8's:0. Difference +89.\n\nSo, total difference: 0 (units) +1 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place would have more, but 89 seems high. Let me check the hundreds place again.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1=89. So, yes, 89 times the hundreds digit is 4. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89)=49+50=99+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAnd in the tens place, 50 4's and 49 8's, so 1 more 4.\n\nUnits place equal, so total difference is 89+1=90.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each group of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 full groups (480 pages) and a partial group of 8 pages (481-488).\n   - Units 4's: 48 (from full groups) + 1 (from 484) = 49.\n   - Units 8's: 48 (from full groups) + 1 (from 488) = 49.\n   - Difference: 49 - 49 = 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - There are 4 full hundreds (400 pages) and a partial hundred (401-488).\n   - Tens 4's: 4\u00d710 (from full hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50.\n   - Tens 8's: 4\u00d710 (from full hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49.\n   - Difference: 50 - 49 = 1.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, contributing 89 4's.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Difference: 89 - 0 = 89.\n\nSumming the differences:\n- Units: 0\n- Tens: +1\n- Hundreds: +89\n\nTotal difference = 0 + 1 + 89 = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, pages 1-9 are single-digit, 10-99 are two-digit, and 100-488 are three-digit. Maybe I should count the number of 4's and 8's in each of these ranges separately.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. In the single-digit pages, only page 4 has a 4, so that's one 4. Now, moving on to two-digit pages, which are from 10 to 99. In the tens place, the 4 can appear in 40-49, which is 10 pages, so that's 10 4's. In the ones place, the 4 can appear in every set of ten, like 14, 24, 34, etc., up to 94. Since there are 9 sets of ten (10-99), but wait, actually from 10 to 99, it's 90 numbers, so the ones place 4 would appear 9 times? Wait, no, from 10 to 99, the ones digit cycles every 10 numbers, so for each ten, there's one 4. So from 10-99, there are 9 sets of ten, so 9 4's in the ones place. So total 4's in two-digit pages would be 10 (tens place) + 9 (ones place) = 19 4's. \n\nWait, but actually, when considering the two-digit numbers, from 10 to 99, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. The ones digit is 4 for 14,24,...,94, which is 9 times because from 10 to 99, the ones digit cycles 9 times (10-19, 20-29, ...,90-99). Wait, but 94 is in the 90-99 range, so that's the ninth occurrence. So yes, 9 4's in the ones place. So total 4's in two-digit pages: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nNow, for the three-digit pages, which are from 100 to 488. Let me break this down into hundreds, tens, and ones places. \n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But when the hundreds digit is 4, the range is 400-488, so we need to consider that separately.\n\nLet's count the 4's in the hundreds place. Only pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. That's 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0-9, and we're looking for where it's 4. So for each hundred, like 100-199, 200-299, etc., the tens digit is 4 in 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. But wait, up to 488, so in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So for each hundred except the last one (400-488), the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times. So from 100-399, that's three hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 3*10=30. Then in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so another 10. So total 4's in the tens place for three-digit numbers: 30 + 10 = 40.\n\nWait, but wait, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 pages, so that's correct. So 40 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the ones place in three-digit numbers. The ones digit cycles every 10 numbers, so for each hundred, the ones digit 4 occurs 10 times. So from 100-399, that's three hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the ones place, so 3*10=30. Then in 400-488, the ones digit 4 occurs in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, that's 9 times because 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, but 494 would be beyond 488. So from 400-488, the ones digit 4 occurs 9 times. So total 4's in the ones place: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 100-399, each hundred has 10 4's in the ones place, so 3*10=30. Then from 400-488, how many times does the ones digit 4 occur? It's every 10 numbers starting from 404, 414, ..., up to 484. Let's see, 404 is the first, then 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 494, which is beyond 488. So yes, 9 times. So total 30 + 9 = 39 4's in the ones place for three-digit numbers.\n\nSo total 4's in three-digit pages: hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + ones place (39) = 89 + 40 = 129 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, but let me add that again: 89 + 40 is 129, plus 39 is 168. So total 4's in three-digit pages: 168.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (168) = 1 + 19 = 20 + 168 = 188. So total 4's printed: 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's. I need to count how many 8's are printed in the page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nStarting with single-digit pages: only page 8, so that's one 8.\n\nTwo-digit pages: from 10 to 99.\n\nIn the tens place, 8 appears in 80-89, which is 10 pages, so 10 8's.\n\nIn the ones place, 8 appears in 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's 9 times because from 10-99, it's 9 sets of ten, each contributing one 8 in the ones place. So 9 8's in the ones place.\n\nSo total 8's in two-digit pages: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nNow, three-digit pages: 100-488.\n\nHundreds place: 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so hundreds digits are 1, 2, 3, or 4. So no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: 8 appears in the tens digit in 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, so the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, but only up to 488. So in each hundred except the last one (400-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in 10 pages. So from 100-399, that's three hundreds, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 3*10=30. Then in 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480 to 488 inclusive). So total 30 + 9 = 39 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 100-399, each hundred has 10 8's in the tens place (e.g., 180-189, etc.), so 3*10=30. Then in 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480,481,...,488), so 9 8's. So total 30 + 9 = 39 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, ones place in three-digit numbers: the ones digit 8 appears in every 10 numbers, so for each hundred, it's 10 times. From 100-399, that's three hundreds, each contributing 10 8's in the ones place, so 3*10=30. Then in 400-488, the ones digit 8 appears in 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 times because 488 is included. So total 30 + 9 = 39 8's in the ones place.\n\nWait, but wait, from 400-488, the ones digit 8 occurs in 408,418,...,488, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page. So yes, 9 times. So total 30 + 9 = 39 8's in the ones place.\n\nSo total 8's in three-digit pages: tens place (39) + ones place (39) = 78.\n\nWait, but let me add that again: 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78) = 1 + 19 = 20 + 78 = 98. So total 8's printed: 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the three-digit 8's count because that seems a bit high. So in three-digit numbers, the hundreds digit doesn't have 8's, so that's zero. Tens place: 39, ones place:39, so total 78. That seems correct.\n\nSo total 4's: 188, total 8's:98. So the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nWait, but let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 4).\n\nTwo-digit: tens place 40-49 \u219210, ones place 14,24,...,94 \u21929, total 19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 \u219289.\n\nTens place: 140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449 \u219210 each for first three hundreds, 10 in 440-449, total 40.\n\nWait, earlier I thought 400-488's tens digit 4 is 10, but actually, 440-449 is 10 pages, so yes, 10. So 3*10 +10=40.\n\nOnes place: 100-399: 10 each hundred, so 30. 400-488: 404,414,...,484 \u21929, so 30+9=39.\n\nTotal three-digit 4's: 89+40+39=168.\n\nTotal 4's:1+19+168=188.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1 (page8).\n\nTwo-digit: tens place 80-89 \u219210, ones place 18,28,...,98 \u21929, total 19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTens place:180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488 \u219210 each for first three, 9 in 480-488, total 3*10 +9=39.\n\nOnes place:100-399:10 each hundred, so 30. 400-488:408,418,...,488 \u21929, so 30+9=39.\n\nTotal three-digit 8's:39+39=78.\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - Only page 4 contains a 4.\n   - Total 4's: 1\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** 40-49 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n   - **Units place:** 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n   - Total 4's: 10 + 9 = 19\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 40 occurrences.\n   - **Units place:** 104, 114, ..., 484 \u2192 39 occurrences.\n   - Total 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n\n**Total 4's:** 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - Only page 8 contains an 8.\n   - Total 8's: 1\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** 80-89 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n   - **Units place:** 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n   - Total 8's: 10 + 9 = 19\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** No 8's.\n   - **Tens place:** 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 39 occurrences.\n   - **Units place:** 108, 118, ..., 488 \u2192 39 occurrences.\n   - Total 8's: 39 + 39 = 78\n\n**Total 8's:** 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, pages 1-9 are single-digit, 10-99 are two-digit, and 100-488 are three-digit numbers. \n\nI guess I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4. I'll consider each position separately.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so I need to check how many complete blocks of 10 there are and then see if there's a partial block at the end.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, the number of complete blocks of 10 is 48 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8). So, each complete block contributes 1 occurrence of 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit goes up to 8. So, in the 49th block (481-490), but since we only go up to 488, the units digit 4 appears once in 484. So, total units place 4's are 48 (from 1-480) plus 1 more in 484, making it 49 times.\n\nWait, no, maybe I should think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to N can be calculated as floor(N/10) + (1 if the units digit of N is >=4 else 0). Wait, but perhaps it's better to calculate it as:\n\nNumber of 4's in units place = number of complete tens * 1 + extra if the last digit is >=4.\n\nWait, let me think again. For example, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. The last such number is 484, which is 48*10 + 4. So, 48 times, plus 1 more if 488 ends with 4, which it doesn't. So, 48 times in units place.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (each 10 numbers), so 48 occurrences. So, units place: 48.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nNow, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nWait, but 488 is less than 450, so the last block would be 440-449, which is within 488. So, how many complete blocks are there? From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449: that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5*10=50.\n\nBut wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place: 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's there.\n\nWait, but 400 to 488 inclusive is 89 numbers, correct. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, total 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. How many times does 8 appear in the units place from 1 to 488?\n\nAgain, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 48 complete blocks (since 488/10=48.8), so 48 times. Plus, if the last number's units digit is >=8, which it is (488 ends with 8), so that's an extra occurrence. So, units place 8's: 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, let me confirm: 8,18,28,...,488. The last one is 488, so yes, that's 49 times.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since we're only going up to 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many complete blocks are there?\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers\n\nSo, that's 4 complete blocks of 10, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, and one partial block contributing 9 8's. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=40+9=49.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 80-89, that's 10 8's in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189, etc., each 10. The last block, 480-488, is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49.\n\nSo, tens place: 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nWait, so total 4's are 187 and total 8's are 98. So, the difference is 187-98=89.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, so 48 complete cycles, each contributing 1, so 48. But wait, 488 is included, so does 488 have a 4 in the units place? No, it ends with 8. So, the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, units place: 48.\n\nTens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 48+50+89=187.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488-8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49.\n\nTens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10, the last contributes 9, so 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:187-98=89.\n\nSo, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 is correct.\n\nAnd for 8's, hundreds place: none, correct.\n\nSo, yeah, the difference is 89.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets of 10, contributing 48 occurrences. The last 4 in the units place is at 484, so no extra count needed. Total: 48.\n   - **Tens Place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 occurrences. Total: 5\u00d710 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, there are 89 numbers with 4 in the hundreds place. Total: 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets, plus an extra at 488. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 complete blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 10 each, and a partial block 480-488 contributing 9. Total: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place. Total: 0.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - More 4's than 8's: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Wait, 488 is a three-digit number, so the page numbers go from 1 up to 488. \n\nI remember that to count the number of times a specific digit appears in a range of numbers, I can break it down by each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. So maybe I should handle each place separately for both 4's and 8's and then compare them.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place one by one.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every set of ten numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, we take the integer part, which is 48. So that's 48 times 4 appears in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so I should check if 484 is within the range. Yes, 484 is less than 488, so that's fine. So units place gives me 48 fours.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers each time. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. How many such blocks are there? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds. So in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly ten numbers. So that's 4 times 10, which is 40 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. Now, what about the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So how many numbers is that? 488 minus 400 plus 1 is 89 numbers. So that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSo adding up the fours in each place: units (48) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 40 = 88, plus 89 is 177. So 177 fours in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place again. Every ten numbers, 8 appears once in the units place, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So how many such sets? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 sets, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is included, so the last 8 in the units place is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10. Let me check: 10*48=480, so the next one is 490, but 488 is less than that. Wait, no, 488 is 48*10 + 8, so actually, it's the 49th occurrence because from 0 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So perhaps I should think of it as (488 + 1) // 10, which is 48.9, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, plus an extra 8 in 488. Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th occurrence. Let me think again.\n\nWait, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (each 10 numbers) and then the 489th number would be 489, which is beyond 488. So actually, the number of 8's in the units place is 48. But wait, 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me just calculate it as (488 // 10) + 1 if the remainder is >=8. So 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. Since 8 >=8, we add 1, so 48 +1 =49. So 49 eights in the units place.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit off because from 1 to 480, there are 48 eights in the units place, and then 488 adds one more, making it 49. So yes, 49 eights in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers each time, like 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So how many complete blocks are there? Let's see, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds. In each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for exactly ten numbers. So that's 4 times 10, which is 40 eights in the tens place. But wait, the last block is 480-488, which is only 9 numbers, so we have to subtract 1. So that's 40 -1 =39? Wait, no, because 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So actually, in the hundreds place, for each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers, except the last one where it's 9. So how many full blocks are there?\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So in each 100 numbers, the tens digit is 8 for exactly 10 numbers. So from 1 to 400, that's 4 times 10 =40 eights in the tens place. Then from 401 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So total eights in the tens place would be 40 +9=49. Wait, that makes sense because from 1 to 488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, 10, 10, 10, and 9. So 4*10 +9=49. So 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 40, but that's without considering the partial block. So yes, it's 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is never 8. So zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 49 eights. So total 98 eights.\n\nWait, but earlier, for fours, I had 177 fours. So the difference would be 177 -98=79. So 79 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems.\n\nStarting with fours:\n\nUnits place: For every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nNumber of complete decades: 488 //10=48, with a remainder of 8. So in each of the 48 decades, 4 appears once, so 48 times. But in the last partial decade, 481-488, 484 is included, so that's an extra 4. So total units place fours: 48 +1=49? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last full decade is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So in each decade, 4 appears once in the units place. So 48 decades would be 48 fours, but in the last decade, 480-488, 484 is included, so that's another 4, making it 49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, maybe I was wrong earlier.\n\nWait, let me recast it. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is given by:\n\ncount = (n // 10) + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nSo for 4 in units place:\n\nn=488, d=4.\n\n488//10=48, and 488%10=8, which is >=4, so count=48+1=49.\n\nSo units place fours:49.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place:\n\nThe formula is a bit more involved. The number of times d appears in the tens place from 1 to n is:\n\ncount = (n // 100) * 10 + min(max(n % 100 - d*10 +1, 0), 10)\n\nSo for d=4, n=488:\n\nn//100=4, so 4*10=40.\n\nn%100=88.\n\nSo 88 -4*10 +1=88-40+1=49.\n\nBut since 49>10, we take min(49,10)=10.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe I'm misapplying the formula.\n\nWait, another approach: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n\nSo from 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So total tens place fours:40 +10=50.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 40. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me check: From 1-400, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). So that's 5 blocks of 10, making 50 fours in the tens place up to 449. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So from 1-488, the tens digit is 4 for 50 numbers. So tens place fours:50.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 40. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier by only considering up to 400. So correct count is 50.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So hundreds place fours:89.\n\nSo total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) =49+50=99, +89=188.\n\nWait, that's different from my initial count. So earlier I had 177 fours, but now I'm getting 188. Hmm, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, let me recount.\n\nUnits place: 49 fours.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place. From 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is another 10. So total tens place fours:40+10=50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nSo total fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So earlier I had miscounted the tens place, thinking it was 40 instead of 50.\n\nNow, for the eights:\n\nUnits place: Using the same formula as before, n=488, d=8.\n\n488//10=48, 488%10=8 >=8, so count=48+1=49.\n\nTens place: Let's use the formula.\n\nn=488, d=8.\n\nn//100=4, so 4*10=40.\n\nn%100=88.\n\nNow, 88 -8*10 +1=88-80+1=9.\n\nSince 9>0 and <=10, we take 9.\n\nSo total tens place eights:40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only from 800-899, which is beyond 488, so 0.\n\nSo total eights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nSo now, the number of fours is 188, and eights are 98. So the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 79, but now it's 90. Hmm, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, let me check the fours again.\n\nUnits place:49.\n\nTens place:50.\n\nHundreds place:89.\n\nTotal:49+50=99, +89=188.\n\nEights:49+49=98.\n\nSo 188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct now. So the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the answer was 79, but now it's 90. I must have made a mistake in my initial counting.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write a small program or use a more systematic approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of each digit place separately and ensure I count correctly.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nCounting the number of 4's:\n\nUnits place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nAs before, it's (488//10)=48 full decades, each contributing one 4, and since 488%10=8 >=4, we add 1 more, making it 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears in blocks of 100 numbers. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4.\n\nFrom 1-400, that's 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, from 401-488, the next block where the tens digit is 4 is 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's another 10.\n\nTotal tens place fours:40+10=50.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers (488-400+1=89).\n\nSo hundreds place fours:89.\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nNow, eights:\n\nUnits place:\n\nAs before, 49 eights.\n\nTens place:\n\nIn the tens place, 8 appears in blocks of 100 numbers. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8.\n\nFrom 1-400, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40.\n\nFrom 401-488, the next block where the tens digit is 8 is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So that's 9 eights.\n\nTotal tens place eights:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNo eights, as 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nSo difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so the correct answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n\nI think earlier I made a mistake in counting the tens place for fours, thinking it was 40 instead of 50, which led to the incorrect difference of 79. Now, after correcting that, the difference is 90.\n\nSo the final answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, actually, since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers can be 1-digit (1-9), 2-digit (10-99), and 3-digit (100-488). \n\nI think I should calculate the number of times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) separately and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. Units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 fours. But wait, the last group is from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers, so the units digit cycles from 1 to 8. So, in the 49th group, which is incomplete, the units digit 4 appears once (at 484). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: Similarly, for every 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, the last partial hundred is from 401 to 488. In this range, the tens digit is 4 for the numbers 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 fours. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nAdding them up: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8:\n\n1. Units place: Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers contribute one 8 in the units place. From 1 to 488, that's 48 complete groups (1-480), giving 48 eights. The last group (481-488) has 8 in the units place at 488, so that's one more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: For every 100 numbers, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are 4 complete hundreds, contributing 4 * 10 = 40 eights. The last partial hundred (401-488) includes 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, no, that's incorrect. The tens digit is 8 for numbers where the tens place is 8, which in the 400s would be 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 appears from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 eights. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds place 8's. So, 0 eights here.\n\nAdding them up: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights in total.\n\nNow, subtracting the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 48 (from 1-480) +1 (484) =49\n- Tens: 4*10=40 (from 1-400) +10 (440-449) =50\n- Hundreds: 89 (400-488)\nTotal: 49+50+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 48 (1-480) +1 (488) =49\n- Tens: 4*10=40 (1-400) +9 (480-488) =49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal:49+49=98. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the Digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one '4'.\n   - From 1 to 480: 480 / 10 = 48 occurrences.\n   - From 481 to 488: '4' appears once at 484.\n   - **Total:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers contribute ten '4's (e.g., 40-49).\n   - From 1-400: 4 sets of 100, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - From 401-488: '4' in tens place from 440-449, which is 10 occurrences.\n   - **Total:** 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - '4' appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total:** 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the Digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one '8'.\n   - From 1-480: 48 occurrences.\n   - From 481-488: '8' appears once at 488.\n   - **Total:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers contribute ten '8's (e.g., 80-89).\n   - From 1-400: 4 sets of 100, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - From 401-488: '8' in tens place from 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n   - **Total:** 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No pages from 800-899, so 0 occurrences.\n   - **Total:** 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately\u2014units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nLet me start by thinking about how many times each digit (4 and 8) appears in each place. So, I'll need to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place, and then sum them up for each digit. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, every 10 pages, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once. So, for example, in pages 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each set of 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears once. Therefore, the number of times each digit appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 pages.\n\nSince the book has 488 pages, the number of complete groups of 10 is 48 (because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups). Wait, no, actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but each group of 10 contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 48 times each. But wait, I should check if there are any leftover pages beyond the 480th page. Pages 481 to 488 are 8 pages, so the units digits in these pages are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in these 8 pages, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so page 488's units digit is 8, so that adds one more 8. So, the units place for 4's is 48 times (from 1-480) plus 1 more at 484, totaling 49. For 8's, it's 48 times (1-480) plus 1 at 488, so also 49. Hmm, so in the units place, both digits appear the same number of times, 49 each.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here because 488 is page 488, so the units digits go up to 8, so yes, 488 is included. So, units place: 49 times each.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each cycle of 100 pages (like 00-99, 100-199, etc.) has each digit from 0 to 9 appearing 10 times in the tens place. So, for example, in the range 00-99, the tens digit is 0 for 00-09, 1 for 10-19, ..., 9 for 90-99. So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place per 100 pages.\n\nNow, how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 is less than 500, so there are four complete hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399. Wait, actually, 488 is 4*100 + 88, so it's four complete hundreds and 88 pages into the fifth hundred. So, in each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (like 40-49 in each hundred), and the same for 8 (like 80-89 in each hundred). So, for each of the four complete hundreds, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 also appears 10 times. So, that's 4*10 = 40 for 4's and 4*10 = 40 for 8's.\n\nNow, we have the remaining 88 pages (from 400 to 488). In these, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. The tens digit in 400-488 is 0 for 400-409, 1 for 410-419, ..., up to 8 for 480-488. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, that's when the tens digit is 4, which would be pages 440-449. That's 10 pages, so 10 times. Similarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place, that's pages 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is only 9 pages because 480 to 488 is 9 pages (including both ends). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 pages: 480,481,...,488. Wait, that's actually 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, so that's 9 times. Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 pages, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 pages. So, in the tens place, in the incomplete hundred (400-488), 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). Therefore, total in the tens place: 4's = 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 = 50, and 8's = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Each complete hundred (0-99, 100-199, etc.) contributes 10 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place. So, four complete hundreds give 4*10=40 for each digit. Then, in the incomplete hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. For 8, it's in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. Therefore, total tens place: 4's = 40 +10=50, 8's=40+9=49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only non-zero starting from page 100. So, from page 1 to 99, the hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's there. From page 100 onwards, the hundreds digit cycles through 1,2,3,4. Wait, up to page 488, so the hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place? Let's see:\n\n- 1 appears in 100-199: 100 times.\n- 2 appears in 200-299: 100 times.\n- 3 appears in 300-399: 100 times.\n- 4 appears in 400-488: 89 times (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89 pages).\n\nWait, 400-488 is 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 never appears in the hundreds place because 800 is beyond 488. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, 4's:89, 8's:0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit across all places.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's:49+50+89= 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nFirst, units place: each 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once. 488 pages: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have 484 and 488, so that's one more 4 and one more 8. So, units place:48+1=49 for 4's, and 48+1=49 for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: each hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place. So, four full hundreds: 4*10=40 for 4's and 40 for 8's. Then, in the last partial hundred (400-488), 4 appears in 440-449 (10 times), and 8 appears in 480-488 (9 times). So, 4's:40+10=50, 8's:40+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488. So, 8's:0.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems high, but maybe that's correct. Let me check another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately and see if the counts make sense.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal:188.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal:98.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place in the incomplete hundred. From 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 4, that's 440-449, which is 10 pages. When the tens digit is 8, that's 480-488, which is 9 pages because 488 is the last page. So, yes, 9 times for 8 in the tens place. So, 4's:10, 8's:9 in that last partial hundred.\n\nWait, another way to check: total number of digits printed.\n\nEach page number from 1 to 488. Pages 1-9: 1 digit each, total 9 digits.\n\nPages 10-99: 90 pages, 2 digits each, total 180 digits.\n\nPages 100-488: 488-99=389 pages, 3 digits each, total 1167 digits.\n\nTotal digits:9+180+1167=1356 digits.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, 8's is 98. So, total 4's and 8's:188+98=286. That leaves 1356-286=1070 digits for other numbers, which seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about how many times each digit appears in each place.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: for each digit place, calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: floor(488/10)=48. Each group contributes one 4 and one 8. So, 48 each.\n\nThen, the remaining pages:488 mod 10=8. So, pages 481-488. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once, 8 appears once. So, units place total:48+1=49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 100: floor(488/100)=4. Each group contributes 10 times each digit in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 for 4's and 40 for 8's.\n\nRemaining pages:488-400=88. So, in the tens place, for 400-488, the tens digit cycles 0-8. So, for 4's in the tens place: when the tens digit is 4, which is 440-449, that's 10 pages. For 8's, when the tens digit is 8, which is 480-488, that's 9 pages. So, 10 for 4's and 9 for 8's.\n\nSo, tens place total:4's=40+10=50, 8's=40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 1000: Well, we're only going up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\n8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so 0 times.\n\nSo, hundreds place:4's=89, 8's=0.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about another way. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each place again.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- For 4's: every 10 pages, so 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have one more 4 at 484. So, 48+1=49.\n\n- Similarly for 8's: same as 4's, 48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For 4's: Each 100 pages, 10 times in the tens place. So, 488 /100=4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place: 4*10=40. Then, in the last 88 pages (400-488), the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (440-449), so 10 more. Total 4's in tens place:40+10=50.\n\n- For 8's: Similarly, 4 full hundreds contribute 4*10=40. Then, in the last 88 pages, the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages (480-488). So, 9 more. Total 8's in tens place:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- For 4's: From 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\n- For 8's: 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, and hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each 10 pages contribute one '4' and one '8'.\n   - There are 48 complete groups of 10 pages in 488, contributing 48 each.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one '4' (at 484) and one '8' (at 488).\n   - Total '4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total '8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each 100 pages contribute 10 '4's and 10 '8's in the tens place.\n   - There are 4 complete hundreds, contributing 40 each.\n   - The remaining 88 pages (400-488) add 10 '4's (440-449) and 9 '8's (480-488).\n   - Total '4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total '8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488, which is 89 times.\n   - The digit '8' never appears in the hundreds place within 488 pages.\n   - Total '4's: 89.\n   - Total '8's: 0.\n\nSumming up:\n- Total '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- Total '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers can be 1-digit (1-9), 2-digit (10-99), and 3-digit (100-488). I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all these page numbers and do the same for the digit 8. Then, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, there are 48 complete groups of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each complete group of 10, there's one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times 1 equals 48. But wait, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (484). So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for every 100 numbers, specifically from 40-49 in each hundred. So, in each hundred, there are 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 numbers (401-488). In each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers each, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 from 440-449. That's another 10 numbers. Wait, but 401-488 includes 401-499, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, adding that, 40 + 10 = 50. So, total 4's in the tens place are 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus the last partial group (481-488), where the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, total 8's in units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for every 100 numbers, specifically from 80-89 in each hundred. So, in each hundred, that's 10 occurrences. There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). So, 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 occurrences. So, total 8's in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus one more in the last group (484), so 49.\n- Tens: Each hundred contributes 10, so 4 hundreds give 40. The last partial hundred (401-488) has 440-449, which is 10, so total 50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 48 complete groups, 48, plus one in 488, so 49.\n- Tens: Each hundred contributes 10, so 4 * 10 = 40. The last partial hundred (401-488) has 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. Total 49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488. \n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times in each hundred, totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears 89 times from 400 to 488.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears 10 times in each hundred and 9 times in the last partial hundred, totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, no, since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488, so the page numbers are from 1 to 488. That means the page numbers can be 1-digit (1-9), 2-digit (10-99), 3-digit (100-488), and maybe even 4-digit if the book had more than 1000 pages, but here it's up to 488, so 4-digit numbers don't come into play.\n\nSo, to find the number of times the digit 4 appears and the number of times the digit 8 appears, I need to count each occurrence in the units place, tens place, and hundreds place separately.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each set of ten numbers. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits go from 1 to 0. Wait, no, actually from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in every 10 numbers. But in the case of page numbers starting at 1, the first set is 1-10, so 0 appears once in 10, but 1 appears in 1, and so on.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of full groups of 10, 100, etc., and then handle the remaining pages. Let's try that.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of times 4 appears in the units place. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, etc. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. In each full block, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 484 would be the 4th number in this partial block, so that's one more 4 in the units place. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place. Using the same logic, each block of 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits include 8, so that's one more 8. So, total 8's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so let me check. The last page is 488, which is part of the 488th page, so the units digits go up to 8 in that case. So, yes, 488 would have an 8 in the units place, so that's correct.\n\nNow, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nFirst, let's find how many full hundreds are there in 488. Well, 488 is less than 500, so we have 4 full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, that's actually 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial hundred from 401-488.\n\nIn each full hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers (40-49, 140-149, etc.), so each full hundred contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, 4 full hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the partial hundred from 401-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? The tens digit in 401-488 is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, 2 for 421-430, 3 for 431-440, 4 for 441-450, and then 5 for 451-460, 6 for 461-470, 7 for 471-480, and 8 for 481-490. Wait, but our range is only up to 488, so the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 numbers. So that's another 10 times. So total 4's in the tens place would be 4*10 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, no, wait a second. Wait, 401-488 is the 8th hundred, right? So, in the 400s, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 in each set of 10. So, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490), but since we only go up to 488, the last set is 481-488, which is 8 numbers, not 10. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place in 401-488? It's only in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 times. So, total 4's in the tens place would be 4*10 (from 1-400) plus 10 (from 401-450), so 50 times.\n\nWait, but wait, 401-488 includes 401-450, which is 50 numbers, and then 451-488, which is 38 numbers. So, in the tens place, 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 times. So, yes, that's correct. So, total 50 times for 4 in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of 8's in the tens place. Using similar logic, in each full hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, in each full hundred, that's 10 times. So, 4 full hundreds would contribute 4*10=40 times. Now, in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480-488. Wait, no, 480 is the first number with tens digit 8 in that partial hundred, and then 481-488 would be the next 8 numbers. So, 480 is one number, then 481-488 is 8 numbers, so total 9 numbers. Wait, but the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but we only go up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 8 occurs 9 times in the partial hundred. Therefore, total 8's in the tens place would be 4*10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. In the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for numbers 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, that's 480, 481, ..., 488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 times. So, total 49 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nFor the digit 8 in the hundreds place, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the hundreds digit is only up to 4. So, 8's in the hundreds place are 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate that. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off because 4's total is 188 and 8's is 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But let me check my calculations again because that seems like a big difference.\n\nWait, let me go through each digit place again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens (each contributing 1) and 1 in the remaining 8, so 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40, plus in 401-488, 441-450 is 10 numbers, so 10 more, totaling 50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, and 1 in the remaining 8, so 49. Correct.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40, plus in 401-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9. Total 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but let me think again because when I first started, I thought maybe the difference would be 90, but I want to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place, in 401-488, the 4's in the tens place occur from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, correct.\n\nWait, but when I was calculating the units place for 4, I had 48 full tens, each contributing 1, and then in the last partial ten (481-488), the units digit 4 occurs once at 484. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, same logic: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, and then in the last partial ten, 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more, totaling 49.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so the units digits in the last partial ten (481-488) are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, yes, 8 occurs once in the units place.\n\nWait, but let me check: when I calculated the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, but 480 is included in the 401-488 range, right? So, 480 is 480, which is in the 400s, so yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but 480 is part of the 401-488 range, so the tens digit 8 occurs from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but 480 is the 480th page, which is within the 401-488 range, so that's included. So, yes, 9 times for 8 in the tens place in the partial hundred.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is: in each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in the 400s, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 9 numbers. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the 400s, the hundreds digit is 4, and the tens digit is 8, so 480-489, but only up to 488, so 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 times.\n\nWait, but let me think: 480 is the first number with tens digit 8 in the 400s, and then 481-488 is 8 more numbers, so total 9. Correct.\n\nSo, 8's in the tens place: 4 full hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 9 in the partial hundred, so 49. Correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just think again if I missed any cases or overcounted.\n\nWait, for the units place, I considered 48 full tens and then 1 in the remaining 8. So, 48 * 1 = 48, plus 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nFor the tens place, 4 full hundreds * 10 = 40, plus in the 400s, 441-450 is 10 numbers, so 10 more, totaling 50. Correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times. Correct.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 48 full tens *1 +1 in the remaining 8, so 49. Correct.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds *10 =40, plus 9 in the partial hundred, so 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 0. Correct.\n\nSo, 4's total: 49+50+89=188.\n\n8's total:49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is there any overlap where a number might have both 4 and 8 in different digit places? But no, when counting occurrences, each digit is counted separately, so overlaps don't affect the count. For example, 448 has two 4's and one 8, so each digit is counted in their respective places.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**4's Count:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full tens (each contributing 1) + 1 in the remaining 8 = 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 full hundreds * 10 = 40 + 10 in the partial hundred = 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 = 89 numbers.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**8's Count:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full tens + 1 in the remaining 8 = 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 full hundreds * 10 = 40 + 9 in the partial hundred = 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 0.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me try to categorize the pages based on their digit lengths and then count the number of 4's and 8's in each category.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9.

Similarly, for 8's in the tens place, we have numbers from 80 to 89, which is another 10 numbers, so 10 eights.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers. The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each ten. So, for each ten (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same for 8. Since there are 9 tens (10-99), each digit 4 and 8 will appear 9 times in the units place. Wait, is that right? Let me check. From 10 to 99, there are 9 sets of ten (10-19, 20-29,...,90-99). So, in each set, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place, so 9 times each. So, in the units place for two-digit numbers, we have 9 fours and 9 eights.\n\nAdding up the tens and units places for two-digit numbers: fours are 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19, and eights are 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. Wait, that seems high. Let me make sure. From 40-49, that's 10 fours in the tens place, and in each ten from 10-19, 20-29, etc., the units digit has one 4, so 9 tens, so 9 fours. So yes, 10 + 9 = 19 fours. Similarly, for eights, 10 in the tens place (80-89) and 9 in the units place (18,28,...,98), so 19 eights.\n\nWait, but hold on, in the two-digit numbers, the tens place for 4's is 10, and units place is 9, so 19 fours. Same for eights, 10 +9=19. So, so far, in two-digit pages, we have 19 fours and 19 eights.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which go from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because each page number now has hundreds, tens, and units places. Let me handle each place separately.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book has 488 pages. So, for the hundreds place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. That's 89 pages (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. How about 8's in the hundreds place? Well, 800 is beyond 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0-9 for each hundred. So, for each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nLet's start with 4's in the tens place. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 every ten pages. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for ten pages (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.). However, for the last hundred, 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, so 400-488 includes 400-480 and 481-488. So, in the 400-488 hundred, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is ten pages. So, for each hundred, 10 fours in the tens place. There are four hundreds: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, actually, 400-488 is only part of the fourth hundred. So, does that affect the count? Let me see. For 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each has a full set of tens digits, so each has 10 fours in the tens place. For 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, so 400-480 is 480, which is 480-400+1=81 pages, but the tens digit cycles 0-9 up to 480. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, yes, 10 fours in the tens place for 400-488 as well. So, total fours in the tens place across all three-digit numbers: 4 hundreds \u00d710 =40 fours.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place. Let's check each hundred. For 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each has a full set, so the tens digit 8 occurs in 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each ten pages, so 10 eights per hundred. That's 3 hundreds \u00d710=30 eights. Now, for 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 pages? Wait, 480 is the first, then 481, 482,...,488. That's 9 pages. So, the tens digit 8 in 400-488 occurs 9 times. So, total eights in the tens place: 30 (from first three hundreds) +9=39.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. For 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 pages, right? Because 480 is the first, then 481 up to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 eights in the tens place for the last hundred.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. The units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, for each hundred, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the units place. But let me check for each hundred.\n\nStarting with 100-199: For each ten (100-109,110-119,...,190-199), the units digit 4 appears once per ten, so 10 fours. Similarly, units digit 8 appears once per ten, so 10 eights.\n\nSame goes for 200-299: 10 fours and 10 eights in the units place.\n\nSame for 300-399: 10 fours and 10 eights.\n\nNow, for 400-488: The units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten, but since it only goes up to 488, we have to check if the units digit 4 and 8 are affected. Let's see, from 400-488, how many complete tens are there? The last page is 488, which is in the 480-489 ten. So, the units digits go up to 8 in that ten. So, for units digits 4 and 8, they each appear once per ten, except perhaps the last incomplete ten. Wait, but 480-488 is a complete ten for units digits 0-8. So, units digits 4 and 8 each appear once in this ten as well. So, how many tens are there in 400-488? From 400-488, that's 89 pages. Divided into tens, that's 9 full tens (400-409, 410-419,...,480-488). Wait, no, 400-488 is 89 pages, which is 8 full tens (400-409, 410-419,...,470-479) and then 480-488, which is 9 pages. Wait, but in terms of units digits, each full ten has digits 0-9, so units digits 4 and 8 each appear once per ten. So, for 400-488, there are 9 full tens (400-409 up to 480-489, but since we stop at 488, the last ten is 480-488, which is 9 pages. Wait, but for units digits, even in the last partial ten, digits 0-8 are present, so 4 and 8 each appear once. So, the number of units digits 4 and 8 in 400-488 would be 9 (from the first 8 full tens) plus 1 each from the last partial ten, totaling 10 fours and 10 eights. Wait, no, because the last ten is 480-488, which is 9 pages, so units digits go up to 8, so 4 and 8 each appear once. So, for 400-488, units digits 4 and 8 each appear 9 times (from the first 9 tens: 400-409, 410-419,...,480-488). Wait, actually, 400-488 is 89 pages, which is 9 tens (each ten has 10 pages except the last one which has 9). Wait, no, 400-409 is 10 pages, 410-419 is another 10, up to 470-479, which is 10, and then 480-488 is 9 pages. So, how many times does units digit 4 appear? In each ten from 400-409, 410-419,...,470-479, and 480-488. So, in each of the first 8 tens (400-409 up to 470-479), units digit 4 appears once, so 8 times. Then, in 480-488, units digit 4 appears once (at 484). So, total units digit 4's in 400-488: 8 +1=9. Similarly, units digit 8 appears once in each of the first 8 tens, so 8 times, and once in 480-488 (at 488), so total 9 times. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier thought. Hmm, maybe I need to recount.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate the number of times each digit appears in the units place across all three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's approach it systematically.\n\nFor three-digit numbers, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, in each hundred, the units digit 4 appears 10 times, as does 8. But for the last hundred, 400-488, we have to check if the units digit 4 and 8 are affected.\n\nWait, 400-488 is 89 pages. Let's see how many complete tens are there. 89 divided by 10 is 8 complete tens (400-409, 410-419,...,470-479) and then 9 pages (480-488). In each complete ten, units digits 4 and 8 each appear once. So, in 8 complete tens, that's 8 fours and 8 eights. Now, in the last 9 pages (480-488), the units digits go from 0 to 8. So, units digit 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units digit 4's in 400-488: 8 +1=9, and units digit 8's: 8 +1=9.\n\nTherefore, across all three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n- Tens place: 4 appears 40 times (10 per hundred \u00d74 hundreds), 8 appears 39 times (10\u00d73 +9).\n- Units place: 4 appears 40 times (10 per hundred \u00d74 hundreds, but wait, no. Wait, for units place, each hundred has 10 fours and 10 eights, but the last hundred only contributes 9 each. Wait, no, because in the last hundred, 400-488, units digits 4 and 8 each appear 9 times, as calculated. So, for units place:\n\n- For hundreds 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: each has 10 fours and 10 eights in units place. So, 3\u00d710=30 fours and 30 eights.\n\n- For 400-488: 9 fours and 9 eights in units place.\n\nSo, total units place:\n\n4's: 30 +9=39\n\n8's:30 +9=39\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place in 400-488 was 9 each, so total units place 4's:3\u00d710 +9=39, same for 8's.\n\nSo, total units place: 39 fours and 39 eights.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought in the tens place, 4's were 40 and 8's were 39. So, let me sum up:\n\nThree-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4's=89, 8's=0\n- Tens place: 4's=40, 8's=39\n- Units place: 4's=39, 8's=39\n\nSo, total for three-digit numbers:\n\n4's: 89 +40 +39=168\n\n8's:0 +39 +39=78\n\nWait, that seems off because 89+40+39=168, and 0+39+39=78. So, 168 fours and 78 eights in three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, let's add up all the counts from single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nSingle-digit:\n\n4's=1, 8's=1\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n4's=19, 8's=19\n\nThree-digit:\n\n4's=168, 8's=78\n\nTotal fours:1+19+168=188\n\nTotal eights:1+19+78=98\n\nWait, but let me check the three-digit counts again because I'm not sure if I did the units place correctly.\n\nWait, in the units place for three-digit numbers, I think I made a mistake. Let me recalculate.\n\nFor three-digit numbers, the units digit 4 appears in each hundred as follows:\n\n- 100-199: 10 fours (104,114,...,194)\n- 200-299:10 fours\n- 300-399:10 fours\n- 400-488:9 fours (404,414,...,484)\n\nSo, total units digit 4's:10+10+10+9=39\n\nSimilarly, units digit 8's:\n\n- 100-199:10 eights\n- 200-299:10\n- 300-399:10\n- 400-488:9\n\nTotal units digit 8's:39\n\nSo, units place:39 fours, 39 eights.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Hundreds 100-199,200-299,300-399: each has 10 fours in tens place (140-149, etc.)\n- 400-488: tens digit 4 in 440-449, which is 10 fours.\n\nSo, tens digit 4's:4\u00d710=40\n\nTens digit 8's:\n\n- 100-199:180-189:10\n- 200-299:280-289:10\n- 300-399:380-389:10\n- 400-488:480-488:9 (since 480-488 is 9 pages)\n\nSo, tens digit 8's:3\u00d710 +9=39\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 400-488:4 appears 89 times\n- 800-899: beyond 488, so 0\n\nSo, hundreds digit 4's:89, 8's:0\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's:\n\n- Units:39\n- Tens:40\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:39+40+89=168\n\n8's:\n\n- Units:39\n- Tens:39\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:39+39=78\n\nSo, three-digit numbers contribute 168 fours and 78 eights.\n\nNow, adding single-digit and two-digit:\n\nSingle-digit:4's=1,8's=1\n\nTwo-digit:4's=19,8's=19\n\nThree-digit:4's=168,8's=78\n\nTotal fours:1+19+168=188\n\nTotal eights:1+19+78=98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check because I might have made a mistake in the three-digit counts.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, 4's are from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 fours. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4's:10 per hundred \u00d74 hundreds=40. Correct.\n\nIn the units place:39 fours. So, 89+40+39=168 fours. Correct.\n\nFor eights:\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nTens place:39\n\nUnits place:39\n\nTotal:78. Correct.\n\nSo, total fours:188, eights:98. Difference:90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because when I thought about the units place in three-digit numbers, I considered that each hundred has 10 fours and 10 eights, but the last hundred only has 9 each. So, 3\u00d710 +9=39 for units place.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Single-Digit Pages (1-9):**\n   - 4 appears once (page 4).\n   - 8 appears once (page 8).\n\n2. **Two-Digit Pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - 4's: 10 times (40-49).\n     - 8's: 10 times (80-89).\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - 4's: 9 times (one in each ten, e.g., 14,24,...,94).\n     - 8's: 9 times (one in each ten, e.g., 18,28,...,98).\n   - Total for two-digit:\n     - 4's: 10 + 9 = 19.\n     - 8's: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\n3. **Three-Digit Pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - 4's: 89 times (pages 400-488).\n     - 8's: 0 times (no page 800-899).\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - 4's: 10 in each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) = 4\u00d710 = 40.\n     - 8's: 10 in each of the first three hundreds and 9 in 400-488 = 3\u00d710 +9 = 39.\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - 4's: 10 in each of the first three hundreds and 9 in 400-488 = 3\u00d710 +9 = 39.\n     - 8's: Similarly, 3\u00d710 +9 = 39.\n   - Total for three-digit:\n     - 4's: 89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (units) = 168.\n     - 8's: 39 (tens) +39 (units) = 78.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **4's:** 1 (single) +19 (two-digit) +168 (three-digit) = 188.\n   - **8's:** 1 (single) +19 (two-digit) +78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) -98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** 90 more 4's than 8's.  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, 488 is a three-digit number, so the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI guess I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position\u2014units, tens, and hundreds\u2014and do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So from 1 to 10, the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So in every block of 10 pages, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in the units place. But wait, in our case, the first page is 1, so the first block is 1-10, and the units digits go from 1 to 0. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears once. So for the units place, the number of 4's and 8's would be the same, right?\n\nBut wait, when we reach the end, like page 488, which is beyond 480, so maybe I should check how many complete blocks of 10 there are and then handle the remaining pages.\n\nTotal pages are 488, so the number of complete blocks of 10 is 48 because 48*10=480, and then there are 8 more pages (481-488). So for the units place, in each block of 10, 4 and 8 each appear once. So for 48 blocks, that's 48 times each. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8. So in the units place, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So total for units place: 48+1=49 times for 4, and 48+1=49 times for 8. So the units place contributes equally to both counts.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages, right? Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each block of 100. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes through 0 (1-9), 1 (11-19), 2 (21-29), ..., 9 (91-99). So each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for each 100 pages.\n\nBut wait, in our case, the total pages are 488, which is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So for each hundred block, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and the same for 8 (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So for each 100 pages, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times in the tens place. So for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10=40 times each.\n\nNow, in the last partial block (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So the tens digits in this partial block are 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., 8 (481-490, but we only go up to 488). So how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? It's from 440-449, but since our last page is 488, 440-449 is fully included. So that's 10 times. Wait, no, because 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, 10 times. Similarly, for 8 in the tens place, it's 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so that's 9 times (480-488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 pages (480,481,...,488), so the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages. Hmm, so in the tens place for the last partial block:\n\n- 4 appears 10 times (440-449)\n- 8 appears 9 times (480-488)\n\nSo adding to the previous 40 times each, the total for tens place:\n\n- 4: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 8: 40 + 9 = 49\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check. Each full hundred contributes 10 times for both 4 and 8 in the tens place. So 4 hundreds give 40 each. Then, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So for 4 in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 pages. For 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages because 488 is the last page. So yes, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times in the tens place of the last partial block.\n\nSo total tens place counts:\n\n- 4: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 8: 40 + 9 = 49\n\nOkay, now moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So for pages 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, which we can ignore since we're only counting 4's and 8's. From page 100 onwards, the hundreds digit cycles through 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. But our book goes up to 488, so the hundreds digits are 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\nLet me see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: This occurs from page 400 to 488. So that's 89 pages (400-488 inclusive). So the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\n- Hundreds digit 8: Wait, does the hundreds digit ever reach 8? The book ends at 488, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So the count for 8 in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nWait, but wait, 488 is page 488, so the hundreds digit is 4, right? So 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo now, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFirst, for the digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate that. 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nNow for the digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo the difference is 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 48 blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8, and then in the last 8 pages, 481-488, units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So 48+1=49 for both, correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for each full hundred, 10 times each for 4 and 8. So 4 hundreds give 40 each. Then in the last partial block (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. So total tens place: 40+10=50 for 4, and 40+9=49 for 8.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so hundreds digit is only up to 4.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 pages has one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks (480 pages) and 8 additional pages.\n   - 48 blocks contribute 48 4's and 48 8's.\n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) add one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - Total: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 pages has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - There are 4 complete hundreds (400 pages), contributing 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - The last partial block (401-488) has 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488 (89 times).\n   - The hundreds digit is never 8.\n   - Total: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think about how to count the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each digit place separately\u2014units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 consecutive pages, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. That means for the units place, the number of 4's and 8's should be the same, right? So, I can calculate how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488 pages. Let me do that: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra pages. In each complete set, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, that's 48 times each. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits are 1 through 8. So, in the units place, the 4 appears once (page 484) and the 8 appears once (page 488). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, they're equal in the units place. Hmm, so the difference here is zero.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for example, from 0-99, the tens digit is 0 for 10 pages (0-9), 1 for 10 pages (10-19), and so on up to 9 for 10 pages (90-99). So, in each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. Now, the book has 488 pages, which is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So, for the tens place, let's see: Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of each digit, so 4 hundreds would contribute 4*10 = 40 times each digit in the tens place. But wait, we have 88 pages beyond the 400th page, so pages 401 to 488. Let me consider the tens place in this range. Pages 401-410 have tens digit 0, 411-420 have 1, ..., up to 481-490 would have 8, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit for pages 481-488 is 8, which is 8 pages. So, in the tens place, how many 4's and 8's do we have? \n\nFrom 1-400: Each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place (since 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times per digit). So, 40 times each for 4 and 8. Now, from 401-488: Let's break this down. The tens digit cycles every 10 pages. From 401-410, tens digit is 0; 411-420, it's 1; 421-430, 2; 431-440, 3; 441-450, 4; 451-460, 5; 461-470, 6; 471-480, 7; and 481-488, 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place beyond 400? It's in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50. Tens place 8's: 40 + 8 = 48. So, in the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 48, so 4's are 2 more.\n\nNow, onto the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488. How many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can't be 8. So, hundreds place 4's: 89, 8's: 0. So, 4's are 89 more in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences in each place:\n\nUnits place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49 \u2192 difference 0.\n\nTens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 48 \u2192 difference +2.\n\nHundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0 \u2192 difference +89.\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 2 + 89 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations. For the units place, 488 pages mean 48 full tens and 8 extra. Each full ten contributes one 4 and one 8, so 48 each, plus in the last 8 pages, units digits are 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once, making total 49 each. That seems right.\n\nIn the tens place, from 1-400: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times per digit, so 40 each. From 401-488: Tens digits go from 0 to 8, but only 441-450 adds 10 more 4's, and 481-488 adds 8 more 8's. So, 4's: 40 +10=50, 8's:40 +8=48. Correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's. 8's: none, since 800 would be beyond 488. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up: units 0, tens +2, hundreds +89. Total difference is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's. No 8's in the hundreds place because the book doesn't go beyond 488. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nWait, no, wait, that's not right. Wait, I think I'm confusing the counts. Wait, no, actually, I think I should just compute the difference, not the total counts. Because the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, I can calculate the total number of 4's and the total number of 8's and subtract.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute the difference in each digit place and sum them up, which I did: units 0, tens +2, hundreds +89, so total difference is 91.\n\nWait, let me confirm the total counts:\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\nUnits: 49\n\nTens:50\n\nHundreds:89\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89= 188.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:48\n\nHundreds:0\n\nTotal 8's:49+48=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, there are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - 488 pages = 48 full tens + 8 extra pages.\n   - 4's: 48 (from full tens) + 1 (page 484) = 49.\n   - 8's: 48 (from full tens) + 1 (page 488) = 49.\n   - Difference: 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times per hundred.\n   - 4 hundreds contribute 40 each.\n   - From 401-488:\n     - 4's: 10 times (441-450).\n     - 8's: 8 times (481-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 8 = 48.\n   - Difference: +2.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (pages 400-488).\n   - 8 never appears.\n   - Difference: +89.\n\n**Total Difference:** 0 (units) + 2 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 91.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Let me think about the ranges.\n\nFrom page 1 to page 9, that's the first 9 pages, and these are single-digit numbers. Then from page 10 to page 99, those are two-digit numbers, and from 100 to 488, those are three-digit numbers. So, I guess I need to analyze each of these ranges separately to count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nStarting with single-digit pages (1-9): Here, the only single-digit numbers are 1 through 9. So, in this range, the digits we're looking for are 4 and 8. Let me see, does 4 appear here? Yes, page 4. And 8 appears as page 8. So, in single-digit pages, there's one 4 and one 8. So, the count so far is 4:1, 8:1.\n\nNext, moving on to two-digit pages (10-99). This is a bit more involved. Each two-digit number has a tens place and a units place. I think I should count the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each place separately.\n\nLet's start with the tens place. For the tens digit, how many times does 4 appear? Well, from 40 to 49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. So, that's 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Similarly, for 8 in the tens place, from 80 to 89, that's another 10 occurrences.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers. The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each ten. So, for each ten (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 14, 24, etc.), and the same for 8 (like 18, 28, etc.). Since there are 9 tens (10-99), that's 9 occurrences for 4 and 9 for 8 in the units place.\n\nWait, actually, from 10 to 99, that's 90 numbers, which is 9 groups of 10. So, yes, 9 times each for units place. So, for two-digit numbers, 4 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times, and 8 appears 10 + 9 = 19 times as well. Hmm, interesting, so in two-digit pages, 4 and 8 each appear 19 times. So, so far, total 4's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) = 20, and 8's: 1 + 19 = 20. So, they're equal so far.\n\nNow, onto the three-digit pages: 100 to 488. This is going to be a bit more complicated because there are more digits to consider. Each three-digit number has hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nLet me break it down by each digit place.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, pages 100-199 have hundreds digit 1, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? That's from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Wait, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 times for 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. Let's consider each hundred group separately.\n\nFor 100-199: The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, for each ten (like 100-109, 110-119, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the tens place (like 140-149), and similarly for 8 (like 180-189). Since there are 10 tens places (0-9), each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for 100-199, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times as well.\n\nSimilarly, for 200-299: Same logic applies. 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (240-249), and 8 appears 10 times (280-289).\n\nSame for 300-399: 4 appears 10 times (340-349), and 8 appears 10 times (380-389).\n\nNow, for 400-488: The tens digit here can be from 0 to 8 because 488 is the last page. So, for the tens digit, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nIn 400-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So, for 4 in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 pages. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 occurrences.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place, it's 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 pages because 488 is the last page. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 pages. So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place for 400-488.\n\nWait, but in 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, but the units digit goes from 0 to 9 except when the tens digit is 8, where it only goes up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, when the tens digit is 8, the units digit only goes up to 8, making it 9 numbers instead of 10.\n\nSo, in 400-488, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times in the tens place (480-488).\n\nSo, adding up all the three-digit numbers:\n\nFor 4 in the tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-449) = 40 times.\n\nWait, no, actually, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (440-449), so total for 4 in tens place across all three-digit numbers is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 100-199: 10 times for 4 in tens place, same for 8.\n\n200-299: 10 each.\n\n300-399: 10 each.\n\n400-488: 10 for 4, and 9 for 8.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40.\n\n8's in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nOkay, that makes sense.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers.\n\nAgain, let's break it down by each hundred group.\n\nFor 100-199: The units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, for each ten, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. There are 10 tens (0-9), so 10 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for 200-299: Same thing. 10 times each for 4 and 8 in units place.\n\nSame for 300-399: 10 times each.\n\nFor 400-488: Now, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten, but the last ten is 480-488, which only goes up to 8. So, in 400-488, how many times do 4 and 8 appear in the units place?\n\nFirst, let's consider each ten:\n\n- 400-409: units digits 0-9, so 4 appears once (404), 8 appears once (408).\n- 410-419: same, 414 and 418.\n- 420-429: 424 and 428.\n- 430-439: 434 and 438.\n- 440-449: 444 and 448.\n- 450-459: 454 and 458.\n- 460-469: 464 and 468.\n- 470-479: 474 and 478.\n- 480-488: units digits 0-8. So, 484 and 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 and 488. That's two occurrences for 4 and one for 8? Wait, no, 484 has a 4 in the units place, and 488 has an 8. But wait, 488 is the last page, so in the units place, 8 appears once (488). So, for 480-488, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 pages: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, each of those digits appears once in the units place for this ten.\n\nSo, for 400-488, each ten from 400-409 up to 470-479 has 1 occurrence of 4 and 1 occurrence of 8 in the units place, and 480-488 also has 1 each. So, how many tens are there? From 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, which is 9 tens. Each ten contributes 1 occurrence of 4 and 1 occurrence of 8 in the units place. So, total for 400-488: 9 times for 4 and 9 times for 8 in the units place.\n\nWait, but in the last ten, 480-488, 488 is the last page, so the units digit only goes up to 8, but does that affect the count? Let me think. For each ten, the units digit goes from 0-9 except for the last ten, which goes up to 8. So, in 480-488, the units digits are 0-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, yes, each ten still contributes 1 each for 4 and 8 in the units place.\n\nSo, in 400-488, units place: 9 times for 4 and 9 times for 8.\n\nWait, no, because 480-488 is the 9th ten, so 9 tens, each contributing 1 each. So, 9 for 4 and 9 for 8.\n\nBut wait, let me check: from 400-488, how many full tens are there? From 400-409, 410-419,... up to 470-479, that's 8 full tens, each contributing 1 each for 4 and 8. Then, the last partial ten is 480-488, which is 9 pages, but as I thought earlier, it still contributes 1 each for 4 and 8 in the units place. So, total 9 tens, each with 1 occurrence, so 9 each.\n\nSo, for 400-488, units place: 9 times for 4 and 9 times for 8.\n\nSo, adding up all three-digit numbers for units place:\n\n100-199: 10 each.\n\n200-299: 10 each.\n\n300-399: 10 each.\n\n400-488: 9 each.\n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off because in 400-488, the units place for 4 and 8 is 9 each, but in the other hundreds, it's 10 each. So, total 4's in units place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39, and same for 8's.\n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, 4 appears 39 times in the units place and 40 times in the tens place, and 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me clarify. In three-digit numbers, we have hundreds, tens, and units places. So, for 4's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 times (400-488).\n- Tens place: 40 times (as calculated earlier).\n- Units place: 39 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0 times.\n- Tens place: 39 times (as calculated earlier).\n- Units place: 39 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nTotal 8's in three-digit numbers: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me double-check.\n\nWait, 4's:\n\n- Hundreds: 89 (from 400-488).\n- Tens: 40 (10 each in 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 10 in 400-449, but wait, earlier I thought it was 10 in 400-488, but actually, in 400-488, the tens place for 4 is 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. So, 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40.\n\nUnits: 39, as calculated.\n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Hundreds: 0.\n- Tens: 39 (10 each in 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 9 in 400-488).\n- Units: 39.\n\nSo, 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nOkay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's and 8's across all page numbers.\n\nTotal 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1.\n- Two-digit: 19.\n- Three-digit: 168.\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1.\n- Two-digit: 19.\n- Three-digit: 78.\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the three-digit counts.\n\nWait, 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n\n8's in three-digit numbers: 0 + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n\nSo, 168 + 19 + 1 = 188 for 4's, and 78 + 19 + 1 = 98 for 8's.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - 4 appears once (page 4).\n   - 8 appears once (page 8).\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - **Units place:** 4 and 8 each appear 9 times (once per ten, across 9 tens).\n   - Total: 19 each.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears 40 times (10 each in 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 10 in 400-449). 8 appears 39 times (10 each in 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 9 in 400-488).\n   - **Units place:** 4 and 8 each appear 39 times.\n   - Total for 4: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n   - Total for 8: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\n**Total counts:**\n- 4's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n- 8's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488, so the page numbers can be 1-digit (1-9), 2-digit (10-99), or 3-digit (100-488).\n\nI guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nFirst, for the units place. In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's 4; in 11-20, it's 14; and so on.\n\nNow, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets and a partial set of 8 numbers (481-488). So, in each complete set, there's one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 occurrences. But wait, in the partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does the digit 4 appear in the units place here? Yes, it's 484. So that's one more occurrence. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of ten numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, etc. Each block contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place.\n\nNow, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? The blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, does 440-449 fit within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's five blocks. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check. The first block is 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, and so on up to 440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 in total.\n\nNow, what about the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me check that calculation again. 400 to 488 inclusive is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, yes, each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 occurrences.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's are 188.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again.\n\nStarting with the units place. As before, in each set of ten, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, similar to the 4's, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488? 48 complete sets, and a partial set of 8 numbers (481-488). So, in each complete set, one 8 in the units place, so 48 occurrences. Now, in the partial set, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once as 488. So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many full blocks we have.\n\nThe blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five blocks, but the last block is only 9 numbers (480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 occurrences, and the last block contributes 9.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 from the last block, totaling 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So yes, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. Wait, the first block is 80-89: that's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences. Then 180-189: another 10, so 20. 280-289: 30. 380-389: 40. 480-488: 9. So, total is 40 + 9 = 49, which matches. So, 49 in tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place was 49, tens place 49, so 98 total. So, 4's are 188, 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nFirst, 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, the last partial set (481-488) has one 4 in the units place (484), so 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Tens place: blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48. The last partial set (481-488) has one 8 in the units place (488), so 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Tens place: blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. First four blocks are 10 each, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. The last block, 480-488, is 9 numbers, so 9. Total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly for the hundreds place in 4's. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place in 4's, five blocks of ten, each contributing 10, so 50. Units place 49, so 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That's correct.\n\nFor 8's, units place 49, tens place 49, so 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When counting the tens place for 8's, the last block is 480-488. So, does that include 488? Yes, because 488 is the last page. So, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, that's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but 480 has 8 in the tens place? Let me see: 480 is 4 (hundreds), 8 (tens), 0 (units). Yes, so 480 has an 8 in the tens place. Similarly, 481 has 8 in the tens place, and so on up to 488. So, that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, that's correct.\n\nAnother thing to check: when counting the units place, for both 4 and 8, we added 1 for the partial set. For 4, it was 484, and for 8, it was 488. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if in the units place, the partial set for 4's is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. The units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484). Similarly, for 8's, the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, both get an extra 1, which is correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the units place again. For 4's, in the partial set, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once, as 484. Similarly, for 8's, 8 appears once as 488. So, that's correct.\n\nI think my counts are accurate. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me recount the 4's and 8's in another way. Maybe using a formula or another method.\n\nAnother approach is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor a number with n digits, the count of a digit d in each position can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor the units place: total numbers / 10.\n\nFor the tens place: total numbers / 100.\n\nFor the hundreds place: total numbers / 1000.\n\nBut since our total is 488, which is a 3-digit number, we can calculate each digit place separately.\n\nWait, perhaps using a formula for each digit place.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488 / 10) + 1 if the units digit is >= 4.\n\nWait, no, the formula is a bit more involved. Alternatively, for each digit place, the number of times a digit d appears can be calculated by:\n\nLet\u2019s denote the current digit position as pos (units=1, tens=10, hundreds=100).\n\nFor each position, split the number into higher, current, and lower parts.\n\nFor example, for the units place (pos=1):\n\n- higher = 488 / 10 = 48\n- current = 488 % 10 = 8\n- lower = 0\n\nIf current > 4, then count += (higher + 1)\nIf current == 4, count += higher\nIf current < 4, count += higher\n\nWait, but this might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to stick with my initial counting method.\n\nWait, but maybe I should just stick with my initial counts since they seem consistent.\n\nSo, I think my initial calculation is correct: 188 4's and 98 8's, difference of 90.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me check the counts again.\n\n4's:\n\n- Units: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus one more in the last partial set (484), so 49.\n- Tens: Five blocks, each contributing 10, so 50.\n- Hundreds: 89 numbers (400-488), so 89.\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's:\n\n- Units: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus one more in the last partial set (488), so 49.\n- Tens: Five blocks, but the last block is only 9 numbers. So, 4 blocks \u00d710 = 40, plus 9 from the last block, totaling 49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if in the tens place for 8's, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 occurrences, which is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: from 0-488, how many times does 8 appear in each digit place?\n\nBut since the book starts at 1, we can consider from 1-488.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a formula for digit counts.\n\nThe formula for counting the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to N is as follows:\n\nFor each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times d appears.\n\nLet me try applying this formula for digit 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with digit 4.\n\nLet\u2019s take each position:\n\n1. Units place:\n\n- Divide 488 by 10: 488 /10 = 48.8, so higher = 48, current = 8, lower = 0.\n\nSince current digit (8) > 4, the count is higher + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place:\n\n- Divide 488 by 100: 488 /100 = 4.88, so higher = 4, current = 8, lower = 88.\n\nSince current digit (8) > 4, the count is higher * 10 + (current - 4) * (lower + 1) = 4*10 + (8-4)*(88 +1) = 40 + 4*89 = 40 + 356 = 396? Wait, that can't be right because that's way too high.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misapplying the formula. Let me check the correct formula.\n\nWait, I think the correct formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the tens place is:\n\ncount = higher * 10 + (if current > d, then 10, else 0) + (if current == d, then lower + 1, else 0)\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to refer to a standard digit counting method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to stick with my initial counting.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since my initial counts seem consistent, maybe I should stick with that.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we need to count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n### Counting the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Each set of 10 numbers contributes 1 occurrence of 4.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - The partial set (481-488) contributes 1 more occurrence (484).\n   - Total: \\(48 + 1 = 49\\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.) contributes 10 occurrences of 4.\n   - There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total: \\(5 \\times 10 = 50\\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Numbers from 400 to 488 contribute 89 occurrences of 4.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** \\(49 + 50 + 89 = 188\\).\n\n### Counting the digit 8:\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Each set of 10 numbers contributes 1 occurrence of 8.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - The partial set (481-488) contributes 1 more occurrence (488).\n   - Total: \\(48 + 1 = 49\\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.) contributes 10 occurrences of 8.\n   - There are 4 complete blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), contributing \\(4 \\times 10 = 40\\) occurrences.\n   - The partial block (480-488) contributes 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: \\(40 + 9 = 49\\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place (800-899 exceeds 488).\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\(49 + 49 + 0 = 98\\).\n\n### Difference:\nThe number of 4's exceeds the number of 8's by \\(188 - 98 = 90\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{90}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me start by considering the different places where digits can appear: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nLet me start by calculating how many times the digit 4 appears in each place (units, tens, hundreds) and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:** The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That's 48 times. But wait, in each group of 10, the units digit goes from 0 to 9, so the 4 appears exactly once per group. So, 48 groups would give 48 fours. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the 48th group ends at 480, right? Then from 481 to 488, that's 8 more pages, so the units digit doesn't hit 4 again. So, 48 fours from the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each cycle of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 pages in the 400s. Wait, but the 400s go up to 488, so the tens digit in the 400s would be 4 for pages 440-449, right? So, each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 fours. But wait, in the 400s, from 400 to 488, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (440-449), so that's another 10 fours. Wait, but that's already included in the 4 hundreds, so maybe I don't need to add more. Wait, 4 hundreds would be 1-400, so the 400s are the fourth hundred. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages. So, 4*10=40 fours in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the 400s, which is from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the fours: units (48) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 48+40=88, 88+89=177. So, total fours are 177.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8:\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8. So, 48 eights. But wait, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit does hit 8 on page 488, so that's an extra 8. So, total units place eights: 48+1=49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each cycle of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, how many hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 pages in the 400s. So, in each hundred, 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40 eights. Now, in the 400s, from 400 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 9 pages (480-488). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 pages, but we only go up to 488, so 9 pages where the tens digit is 8. So, that's 9 more eights. So, total tens place eights: 40+9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the 800s, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the total eights from total fours: 177 - 98 = 79.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor fours:\n- Units: 48 (since 488/10=48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing a 4, plus in the 488, units digit doesn't add another 4)\nWait, earlier I thought 48 fours, but when I considered the 400s, I might have confused something. Wait, no, actually, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 times, each contributing a 4, so 48 fours. Then in the tens place, each hundred contributes 10 fours, so 4 hundreds give 40, plus in the 400s, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (440-449), so that's another 10, making 50. Wait, no, wait, I think I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the tens place for fours. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so 4 hundreds would be 4*10=40. But in the 400s, from 400 to 488, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (440-449). So, that's included in the 4 hundreds, right? Because the 400s are part of the 4th hundred. So, 4*10=40, correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the hundreds place for fours is 89, which is from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nSo, fours total: 48 (units) + 40 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 177.\n\nFor eights:\n- Units: 48 full tens, each contributing an 8, so 48, plus the last page 488 has a units digit 8, so 49.\n- Tens: Each hundred has 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then in the 400s, from 400 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-488, which is 9 pages (since 488 is the last page). So, 40+9=49.\n- Hundreds: 0, since the book doesn't reach 800.\n\nSo, eights total: 49+49=98.\n\nThus, the difference is 177-98=79.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes when counting the hundreds place, I might have miscounted.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place for fours, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so 89 fours. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place for fours, each hundred contributes 10 fours, so 4 hundreds give 40, plus in the 400s, 440-449 is another 10, so that's 50? Wait, no, wait, 4 hundreds already include the 400s. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages, so 4*10=40, which includes the 440-449 in the 400s. So, I think that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in the tens place, each hundred gives 10, so 4*10=40, and then in the 400s, 480-488 gives 9 more, totaling 49.\n\nUnits place for eights: 49, as the last page is 488, which adds one more 8.\n\nSo, yes, 177 fours and 98 eights, difference is 79.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is the hundreds place for fours correctly 89? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place, each of these 89 pages has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 fours. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear? Every 10 numbers, so 48 times, plus in 488, the units digit is 8, so no extra 4, so 48 fours in the units place.\n\nWait, but wait, when we count units digits, 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 times, correct.\n\nSo, yes, units:48, tens:40, hundreds:89, total 177.\n\nEights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0, total 98.\n\nSo, 177-98=79.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 79 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (once every 10 numbers, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 full groups).\n- **Tens place:** 40 occurrences (10 per hundred, 4 hundreds \u2192 4 \u00d7 10).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (pages 400\u2013488 inclusive).\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 40 + 89 = 177.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (48 full groups plus page 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (40 from hundreds plus 9 from pages 480\u2013488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences (book ends at 488).\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 177 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 79.\n\n$\\boxed{79}$"

    "text": " Wait, since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488, so the highest is a three-digit number, 488.\n\nI think the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) separately and then do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place one by one.\n\nFirst, the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, 4, 14, 24, etc. Now, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). In each complete block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 484 have a 4 in the units place? Yes, 484. So that's one more 4. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for the tens digit, every 100 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. For example, in 0-99, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, in each 100-number block, there are 10 4's in the tens place. Now, how many complete 100s are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 numbers (401-488). In each complete hundred, there are 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 (since 401-409 have tens digit 0, 410-419 have 1, and so on up to 480-488 having 8). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? Well, the block 440-449 would have 4 in the tens place for all 10 numbers. But wait, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449. So that's 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that's 10 more 4's. So total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: Units (49) + Tens (50) + Hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8, so 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more. So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: Similar to 4's, every 100 numbers have 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, 4 complete hundreds give 4*10=40. Now, the remaining 88 numbers (401-488). The tens digit is 8 in the block 480-488. Wait, how many numbers is that? From 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481,...,488). So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. In the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? Because 480 is included, so 480, 481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So that's correct.\n\nSo total 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nNow, subtracting the total number of 8's from 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 48 full decades, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in 481-488, 484 has a 4 in units, so +1. Total 49.\n\n- Tens: Each hundred has 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so +10. Total 50.\n\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 48 full decades, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, 488 has an 8 in units, so +1. Total 49.\n\n- Tens: Each hundred has 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so +9. Total 49.\n\n- Hundreds: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that I double-counted any digits? For example, in the number 448, does it have both a 4 in tens and hundreds place? Yes, but I counted each digit separately, so that's correct.\n\nAnother way to check is to consider that in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, which is a significant number, so it's likely that 4's are more than 8's.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 4.\n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 full decades, each with 1 occurrence: 48.\n   - Remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 484, adding 1.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers contribute 10 occurrences.\n   - 488 \u00f7 100 = 4.88 \u2192 4 full hundreds, each with 10 occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Remaining 88 numbers include 440-449, adding 10.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Numbers 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 8.\n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 full decades: 48.\n   - Remaining 8 numbers include 488, adding 1.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers contribute 10 occurrences.\n   - 488 \u00f7 100 = 4.88 \u2192 4 full hundreds: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Remaining 88 numbers include 480-488, adding 9.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No numbers in 1-488 have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think about how many digits each page number has.\n\nSo, the first page is 1, which is a single digit. Pages 1 through 9 are single-digit numbers. Then, starting from page 10, they become two-digit numbers up to page 99. After that, from page 100 onwards, they become three-digit numbers, right? Since the book has 488 pages, the last page is 488, which is a three-digit number. So, I guess I need to calculate the number of times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and similarly for the digit 8, and then find the difference between the counts of 4's and 8's.\n\nLet me start by calculating the number of 4's. I'll break it down by each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. How many such groups are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, we take the integer part, which is 48 full groups. Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 fours. But wait, the last group might not be complete. Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so the last group is from 481 to 488. In the units place, 484 has a 4, and 488 has an 8. So, in the incomplete group, there's still one 4 in the units place (484). So, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, actually, when I divided 488 by 10, I got 48.8, but maybe a better way is to think that for the units digit, the number of times 4 appears is equal to the number of complete tens plus any additional in the incomplete set. So, 488 pages mean that the units digit cycles 48 full times (from 1 to 480) and then 8 more numbers (481 to 488). In each full cycle of 10, 4 appears once, so 48 times. In the incomplete set of 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once here as well (484). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. Similarly, for the tens digit, each group of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89). But wait, we need to adjust for the total number of pages, which is 488. So, how many full hundreds are there?\n\n488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each full hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 fours in the tens place. Now, in the incomplete set of 88 pages (401-488), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nLooking at 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 in the range 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 fours in the tens place. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. Let me make sure. From 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490), but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 occurs only up to 488. But for the tens digit 4, it occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So, yes, 50 in total for the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same calculation for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4's, in each group of 10, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 pages mean 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48 eights. Then, the incomplete group from 481-488 has units digits 1-8, so 8 appears once here as well (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. For the tens digit, each full hundred has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place (80-89). So, for 4 full hundreds (1-400), that's 4*10=40 eights. Then, in the incomplete set from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place here? From 480-488, that's 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, 9 eights.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. So, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier for the tens place, I thought that in the incomplete group from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 times, so 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nWait, 400 is included, so 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 fours.\n\nFor the 8's, in the hundreds place, it's zero because 488 is less than 800. So, correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again for 8's. In the incomplete set from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 eights in the tens place. So, 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place for 4's, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So, 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the units place for 4's. From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nIt's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many such numbers? The last one is 484, which is 480 + 4, so 484 is the 49th occurrence because 484 is 48*10 + 4, so 48 full tens plus one more, making 49.\n\nSimilarly for 8's in the units place: 8,18,28,...,488. So, 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences as well.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's in the units place were 49 and 8's were 49 as well, but that's not matching with the total counts. Wait, no, because for 4's, units place was 49, tens place 50, hundreds place 89, totaling 188. For 8's, units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, totaling 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that for each digit place, we can calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use a formula or a more systematic approach.\n\nFor any digit place (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times a digit d appears can be calculated by:\n\n- Let n be the number of pages, which is 488.\n\n- For each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times d appears.\n\nLet me try this for 4's:\n\nUnits place:\n\n- The number of complete cycles of 10 is floor(488 / 10) = 48.\n\n- Each cycle contributes 1 occurrence of 4 in the units place, so 48.\n\n- The remainder is 488 % 10 = 8. So, in the incomplete cycle, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? It's min(8 - 4 + 1, 0) if 4 <= 8, else 0. Wait, no, the numbers are 481-488, so units digits from 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n\n- The number of complete cycles of 100 is floor(488 / 100) = 4.\n\n- Each cycle contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\n- The remainder is 488 % 100 = 88.\n\n- Now, in the incomplete cycle, we look at the tens digit. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 in the last 88 numbers (401-488). The number of times 4 appears in the tens place is determined by how many full tens are there and the remainder.\n\n- The tens digit is 4 in the range 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Since 449 is less than 488, all 10 numbers are included. So, 10 occurrences.\n\n- So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- The number of complete cycles of 1000 is floor(488 / 1000) = 0.\n\n- So, no contribution from higher cycles.\n\n- The remainder is 488.\n\n- Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488, which is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 occurrences.\n\n- So, total hundreds place 4's: 0 + 89 = 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\nUnits place:\n\n- Complete cycles: floor(488 / 10) = 48.\n\n- Each contributes 1 occurrence, so 48.\n\n- Remainder: 8.\n\n- In the incomplete cycle (481-488), units digits are 1-8. So, 8 appears once (488).\n\n- Total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Complete cycles: floor(488 / 100) = 4.\n\n- Each contributes 10 occurrences, so 4*10=40.\n\n- Remainder: 88.\n\n- In the incomplete cycle (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 occurrences.\n\n- Total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- Complete cycles: floor(488 / 1000) = 0.\n\n- Remainder: 488.\n\n- The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, which is beyond 488, so 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I didn't make a mistake in the tens place for 8's. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 eights in the tens place. So, 40 + 9 = 49, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, from 401-488, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So, 40 + 10 = 50, which is correct.\n\nI think this makes sense. So, the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one '4' in the units place.\n   - Complete groups: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 groups, contributing 48 '4's.\n   - Remainder: 8 numbers (481-488), where '4' appears once (484).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49 '4's.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers contribute ten '4's in the tens place.\n   - Complete groups: 488 \u00f7 100 = 4 groups, contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 '4's.\n   - Remainder: 88 numbers (401-488), where '4' appears in 440-449 (10 '4's).\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50 '4's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - '4' appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total: 89 '4's.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one '8' in the units place.\n   - Complete groups: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 groups, contributing 48 '8's.\n   - Remainder: 8 numbers (481-488), where '8' appears once (488).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49 '8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers contribute ten '8's in the tens place.\n   - Complete groups: 488 \u00f7 100 = 4 groups, contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 '8's.\n   - Remainder: 88 numbers (401-488), where '8' appears in 480-488 (9 '8's).\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49 '8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0 '8's.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately\u2014units, tens, and hundreds. That way, I can count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 consecutive pages, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. That means for each 10 pages, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Now, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 full sets and then 8 extra pages. In each full set, we have one 4 and one 8, so that's 48 times each. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, 4 appears once (page 484) and 8 appears once (page 488). So, total 4's in units place would be 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's would be 48 + 1 = 49. So, for units place, they're equal.\n\nNext, the tens place: The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for each hundred, there are 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. Now, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). So, for each of the 4 hundreds, we have 10 4's and 10 8's, totaling 4*10 = 40 each. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. Let's see: from 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, it's 1; and so on up to 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit here is 8 for pages 481-488. Wait, no, 481-490 would have tens digit 8, but we stop at 488, so that's 8 pages. So, in the tens place, how many 4's and 8's do we have? Let's see:\n\nFrom 401-410: tens digit 0\n411-420: 1\n421-430: 2\n431-440: 3\n441-450: 4\n451-460: 5\n461-470: 6\n471-480: 7\n481-488: 8\n\nSo, in the tens place, within 401-488, the digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 pages, but wait, 441-450 is 10 pages, but 488 is only up to 488, so actually, 441-450 is entirely within 401-488, right? Because 450 is less than 488. So, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times here. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, that's 8 pages (481-488). So, in the tens place, in the remaining 88 pages, we have 10 4's and 8 8's. So, total for tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 8 = 48 for 8's.\n\nWait, but hold on, I think I made a mistake here. Because in the full hundreds, each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 40 each. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles through 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's from 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. And 8 appears from 481-490, but we only have up to 488, so that's 8 pages. So, yes, 10 and 8. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nSo, so far, in the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 48. So, 4's are more by 2 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 5 for 400-488. Wait, no, 400-488 would have hundreds digit 4, right? Wait, 400-488 is part of the 400s, so hundreds digit is 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times. How about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's are 89 and 8's are 0. So, 4's are way more here.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place: 48 full sets of 10 pages, each contributing one 4 and one 8. So, 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, 48 +1 =49 for both. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. 4 hundreds, so 40 each. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 pages, and 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, 40 +10 =50 for 4's and 40 +8=48 for 8's. That seems right.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times. 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So, 0.\n\nAdding up: 49 +50 +89 =188 for 4's, and 49 +48 +0=97 for 8's. Difference is 91.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1 =89 pages, correct. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nAnother way to think about it: The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but another thought: When I'm counting the tens place, I considered 401-488 as 88 pages, but actually, 401-488 is 88 pages because 488 -400 =88, but since we include both endpoints, it's 88 +1=89 pages. Wait, no, 401 is the first page after 400, so 401-488 is 488 -400 =88 pages, but since we include both 401 and 488, it's 88 pages. Wait, no, 401 to 488 is 88 pages because 488 -401 +1=88. So, 88 pages. So, in the tens place, from 401-488, which is 88 pages, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nWait, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but we stop at 488). So, for the tens digit 4, it's in 441-450, which is 10 pages. For the tens digit 8, it's in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, that's 8 pages. So, 10 and 8, respectively.\n\nWait, but the total number of pages in 401-488 is 88, and 10 (for 4) +8 (for 8) =18, but 18 is less than 88, so maybe I'm missing something. Wait, no, because in each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9, so in 88 pages, we have 8 full tens (0-7) and 8 pages of the 8th tens. Wait, maybe I should think differently.\n\nAlternatively, for the tens place in 401-488, how many times does each digit appear? Each digit from 0-8 appears a certain number of times. For digits 0-7, each appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 400-409: tens digit 0, 410-419: tens digit 1, etc.), but since we're starting at 401, the first set is 401-410, which is 10 pages with tens digit 0. Then, 411-420: 10 pages with tens digit 1, and so on up to 471-480: tens digit 7, and then 481-488: 8 pages with tens digit 8.\n\nSo, for tens digits 0-7, each appears 10 times, and for 8, it's 8 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears when the tens digit is 4, which is 441-450, which is 10 pages. Similarly, 8 appears when the tens digit is 8, which is 481-488, 8 pages. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, adding up, the tens place in 401-488 gives 10 4's and 8 8's. So, total for tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) +10=50 for 4's, and 40 +8=48 for 8's.\n\nSo, overall, 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188\n\n8's: 49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=97\n\nDifference: 188 -97=91\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I missed something in the units place. For units place, in the last 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 full sets of 10 pages, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, in the remaining 8 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once. So, total 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so the last page is 488, so units digit 8 appears there. So, yes, 488 is included, so 8 appears once in the units place in the last 8 pages.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, and hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total full sets of 10 pages: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8).\n   - 4 and 8 each appear 48 times in the units place.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488): 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Total full sets of 100 pages: 4, contributing 10 times each for 4 and 8.\n   - Remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n     - Tens digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450).\n     - Tens digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n   - Total in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4; 40 + 8 = 48 for 8.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have the hundreds digit as 4, appearing 89 times.\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total in hundreds place: 89 for 4; 0 for 8.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 97 = 91\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should look at each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every group of ten pages, like 1-10, 11-20, and so on, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. So, for the units place, the number of 4's and 8's should be the same, right? But wait, the book has 488 pages, so the last group might not be a complete set of ten. Let me check that.\n\nThe total number of pages is 488, so the number of complete groups of ten is 48 (since 48*10=480), and then there are 8 more pages (481-488). So, in the units place, for each complete group of ten, both 4 and 8 appear once. So, 48 groups would give 48 4's and 48 8's in the units place. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, in the units place, total 4's are 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. So, they're equal here.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. Wait, actually, from 1-100, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. So, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 pages, same with 8. \n\nSince the book has 488 pages, let's see how many complete hundreds we have. 488 divided by 100 is 4, with 88 pages remaining. So, for the first 400 pages, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 appears 4*10 = 40 times, and 8 appears 4*10 = 40 times in the tens place. Now, the remaining 88 pages are from 401 to 488. Let's look at the tens digit here. \n\nFrom 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 (in 401-410) up to 8 (in 481-490, but we only go up to 488). So, let's break it down:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nWait, so from 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but each of these is only 10 pages except the last one, which is 8 pages (481-488). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place in this range? It's only in 441-450, which is 10 pages. Similarly, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? It's in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, that's 8 pages. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 8 times in the remaining 88 pages.\n\nSo, total in the tens place: 4's are 40 (from first 400) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50. 8's are 40 (from first 400) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48.\n\nWait, that seems right. So, in the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 48, so 4's have 2 more here.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so it doesn't contribute. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, 200-299 it's 2, 300-399 it's 3, and 400-488 it's 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's are 89 and 8's are 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the digits:\n\n- Units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49\n- Tens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 48\n- Hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate that. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so 4 appears 89 times. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 441-450, which is 10 times, and 8 in 481-488, which is 8 times. So, adding to the first 400 pages, which had 40 each, so 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, 8's: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each, plus in the last 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place 4's: 48 +1 =49, same for 8's: 48 +1=49.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99 +89=188.\n\nTotal 8's: units (49) + tens (48) + hundreds (0) = 49 +48=97.\n\nSo, 188 -97=91. So, 4's are printed 91 more times than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again: in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, which is a significant number. That's why the difference is so large. Let me check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place.\n\nFrom page 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so yes, that's 89 times. So, 4's in hundreds place:89.\n\n8's in hundreds place:0.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears 10 times in 441-450, and 8 appears 8 times in 481-488. So, 50 and 48 respectively.\n\nUnits place: 49 each.\n\nSo, yes, 188 vs 97. So, the difference is 91.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 4's in the hundreds place seem to dominate. Let me think if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately and then find the difference.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\n- Units place: For every 10 pages, one 4. So, total groups of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full groups (480 pages) and 8 extra pages. So, 48*1 +1=49.\n\n- Tens place: For every 100 pages, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in each 100 pages, 10 4's in the tens place. So, 4*100 pages would have 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, as before, 441-450 is another 10, so total 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\n- Units place: Same as 4's, 49.\n\n- Tens place: From 1-488, in the tens place, each 100 pages has 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 more. So, 40+8=48.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's:49+48+0=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nI think I did this correctly. So, the answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - For every 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete groups of 10 pages (480 pages), contributing 48 each.\n   - In the last 8 pages (481-488), both 4 and 8 appear once.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4's and 8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - For every 100 pages, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n   - In the first 400 pages, 4 and 8 each appear 40 times.\n   - From 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's and 40 + 8 = 48 for 8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 for 4's and 0 for 8's.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 97 = 91\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Wait, since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488, so the highest is a three-digit number. \n\nI think the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for the digit 8, then subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. \n\nFirst, let's consider the units place. In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's 4; 11-20, it's 14; and so on. So, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets and then an extra 8 pages. In each complete set, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Plus, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once in 484. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers in each hundred. For example, in 1-100, it's 40-49, which is ten numbers. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are four complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these contributes ten 4's in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, looking at the last partial hundred, 401-488. In the tens place, 40-49 would be 40-49, but wait, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on. Wait, actually, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 would be in 440-449. That's ten numbers, so that's another ten 4's. So total 4's in the tens place would be 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's printed are 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check. For units place: each 10 numbers have one 4, so 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48, and then in the last 8 numbers (481-488), 484 has a 4, so 48 +1 =49. That seems right.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so 4 hundreds (1-400) would be 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is another 10, so 40+10=50. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So 89 4's there. So total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in each place.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, each set of ten numbers has one 8 in the units place. So, 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So, total units place 8's: 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, for each hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.), there are 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would contribute 4*10=40. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 8 would be in 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place here. Wait, that's different from the 4's where it was 10. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10=40 from the first four hundreds, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 +1=9. So, yes, 9 8's in the tens place in the last partial hundred. So, 40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only when the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total 8's printed are 98.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, total 40 +9=49. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the units place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus one more in 488, so 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98.\n\nSo, now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, when counting the 4's in the tens place, I considered 401-488, and said that the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is ten numbers, so 10 4's. That's correct because 440-449 is within 401-488. So, 10 4's in the tens place there.\n\nFor the 8's in the tens place, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. That's correct because 488 is included.\n\nSo, 4's total: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's total:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me check another way. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, 89 4's there. That's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as for each digit place separately.\n\nAnother approach: For each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10)=48, plus if the last digit is >=4, add 1 if the remainder is >=4. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with remainder 8, which is >=4, so add 1. So, 48 +1=49 4's.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's: floor(488/10)=48, plus if the remainder is >=8, add 1. The remainder is 8, so 48 +1=49 8's.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40. Then, the remainder is 88, so we look at how many tens digits 4 are in 0-88. The tens digit 4 occurs from 40-49 in each hundred, so in 0-88, it's 10 numbers (40-49). So, total 40 +10=50.\n\nNumber of 8's: floor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40. Then, the remainder is 88, so in 0-88, the tens digit 8 occurs from 80-88, which is 9 numbers. So, total 40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/1000)=0, but since 488 >=400, the hundreds digit 4 occurs from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nNumber of 8's: floor(488/1000)=0, and since 488 <800, there are 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check with an alternative method. Maybe by considering each digit place separately and calculating the count.\n\nUnits digit:\n\nFor 4's: As before, 49.\n\nFor 8's: 49.\n\nTens digit:\n\nFor 4's: 50.\n\nFor 8's:49.\n\nHundreds digit:\n\nFor 4's:89.\n\nFor 8's:0.\n\nSo, yes, the counts are correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as for each digit place, how many times does 4 appear, and how many times does 8 appear.\n\nAnother way: The number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N is:\n\ncount_units = (N // 10) + (1 if N % 10 >= d else 0)\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place:\n\ncount_tens = (N // 100) * 10 + (min(max(N % 100 - d*10 +1, 0),10))\n\nWait, maybe that's more complicated, but let me try.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits place: (488 //10)=48, and since 488%10=8 >=4, add 1: 49.\n\nTens place: (488 //100)=4, so 4*10=40. Then, the remainder is 88. The tens digit 4 occurs from 40-49 in the last partial hundred, so 10 numbers, so 40+10=50.\n\nHundreds place: (488 //1000)=0, but since 488 >=400, we have 488 -400 +1=89.\n\nSimilarly for 8's:\n\nUnits place: (488//10)=48, and 488%10=8 >=8, so 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place: (488//100)=4, so 4*10=40. The remainder is 88, so the tens digit 8 occurs from 80-88, which is 9 numbers, so 40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, same result.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, actually, since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488, so the highest number is a three-digit number, 488.\n\nI think I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every 10 pages, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10 and then 8 extra pages. So, in each of the 48 full sets, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so the digit 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. So, total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nNext, the tens place. Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages beyond that (401-488). In each full hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers, so that's 4 times 10, which is 40. Now, in the last 88 pages (401-488), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Well, 401-409: that's 9 pages where the tens digit is 0, but wait, no, 401-409 is actually tens digit 0, and 410-419 would be tens digit 1, but wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 401-409 is tens digit 0, and then 410-419 is tens digit 1, so actually, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449. So that's 10 more times. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 40 (from the full hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50 times.\n\nWait, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that's correct. So, total 4's in the tens place are 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 times.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 fours in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full sets of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so that's one more 8. So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. Again, the tens digit cycles every 100. In each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, how many full hundreds are there in 488? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so 4 times 10 = 40. Now, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480-488. So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because when I calculated 4's, I got 187, and 8's as 98, so the difference would be 89. But let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, when I calculated the 8's in the units place, I had 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48, and then in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, each full hundred contributes 10 8's, so 4 full hundreds give 40. Then, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so 0. So, total 8's are 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but when I calculated 4's, I got 187. So, 187 fours minus 98 eights equals 89. So, there are 89 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me check the 4's again because I might have made a mistake there.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 48 times, correct.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in the last 88 pages, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 more. So, 40 + 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89. So, total 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nSo, 187 fours and 98 eights, so 187 - 98 = 89. So, the answer should be 89 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Maybe I should recount the 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, in the last 88 pages, from 401 to 488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. But 480 is included, right? So, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's 9 times the tens digit is 8. So, 9 is correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, for each hundred, it's 10 numbers, so 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contributing 10. So, 4 hundreds, 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred, 480-488, that's 9. So, 40+9=49. That's correct.\n\nWait, but when I calculated the 4's in the hundreds place, I considered 400-488 as 89 numbers, which is correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nHmm, so I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 89.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

So, units place has the same number of 4's and 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears ten times in a block of 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles 0-9 each ten times. So, in each block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and the same for 8 (80-89). \n\nHow many full hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 = 40 for 4's and 40 for 8's so far in the tens place.\n\nNow, we have the remaining pages from 401-488. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. From 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. Let's break it down:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nSo, in the 400s, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, then 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place from 441-450, which is 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place from 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, that's 8 pages (481-488), so the tens digit is 8 for 8 pages. Wait, no, actually, the tens digit is 8 for 481-490, but since we stop at 488, it's 8 pages. So, the tens digit is 8 for 8 times? Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 for the entire 480-489 range, which is 10 pages, but we only have 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in 481-488.\n\nWait, but wait, when considering the tens place, each block of 100 pages has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, in 401-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? From 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. For 8, from 481-490, but we only go up to 488, so that's 8 pages where the tens digit is 8. So, in the tens place, in 401-488, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, total tens place counts:\n\nFor 4's: 4 full hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 10 in 441-450, so total 50.\n\nFor 8's: 4 full hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 8 in 481-488, so total 48.\n\nWait, but wait, in the full hundreds (1-400), we have 40 4's and 40 8's in the tens place. Then, in 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, total for 4's in tens place is 40 + 10 = 50, and for 8's, it's 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 48 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case, since the book has 488 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 1 from 1-99, 2 from 100-199, 3 from 200-299, and 4 from 300-399, 400-488.\n\nWait, actually, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, but since we're only considering page numbers starting from 1, the hundreds digit is 1 from 100-199, 2 from 200-299, 3 from 300-399, and 4 from 400-488.\n\nWait, but page numbers from 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit, so the hundreds digit is 0, but since we're only considering digits printed, maybe we should include 0 as a possible digit, but in this problem, we're only looking for 4's and 8's, so 0 doesn't count. So, in the hundreds place, how many times does 4 appear? It's from 400-488, which is 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total hundreds place counts:\n\n4's: 89 times.\n\n8's: 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8, so 48 each. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, 48 + 1 = 49 for both, correct.\n\nTens place: For 4's, in each hundred, 10 times, so 4 hundreds *10=40. Then, in 401-488, 441-450 is 10 pages, so 10 more, total 50 for 4's. For 8's, in each hundred, 10 times, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, 481-488 is 8 pages, so 8 more, total 48 for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times. 8 never appears in hundreds place, so 0.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =97.\n\nDifference: 188 -97=91.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those. So, 89 times, correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: From 1-99, hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's there. From 100-399, hundreds digit is 1,2,3, so no 4's or 8's in hundreds place. From 400-488, hundreds digit is 4, so 89 times.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's printed is 188, and 8's is 97, so the difference is 91. So, there are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 91.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Wait, since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488, so the last few pages will have three digits, right?\n\nAlright, maybe I should separate the problem into looking at the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place separately for both digits 4 and 8. That way, I can calculate how many times each digit appears in each position and then sum them up.\n\nLet's start with the digit 4. I'll need to count how many times 4 appears in the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10: 4; 11-20: 14; and so on. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 fours. But wait, the last block is from 481 to 490, but since the book ends at 488, the units digit 4 would appear once more in 484. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 fours in the units place.\n\nWait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete tens plus any remaining numbers where the units digit is 4.\n\nSo, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete tens, each contributing one 4, and then in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), does 484 fall within that? Yes, 484 is in 481-488, so that's one more 4. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nOkay, moving on to the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for every block of 100 numbers. Specifically, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds. But wait, let's check each hundred:\n\n- 1-100: 40-49 \u2192 10 fours\n- 101-200: 140-149 \u2192 10 fours\n- 201-300: 240-249 \u2192 10 fours\n- 301-400: 340-349 \u2192 10 fours\n- 401-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 fours\n\nWait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10 fours. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, total tens place 4's are 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in all of these, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first number with 4 in the hundreds place, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 gives 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's are units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4, in every block of 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete tens are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), does 488 fall within that? Yes, 488 is in 481-488, so that's one more 8. So, units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for every block of 100 numbers, specifically in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488.\n\nSo, let's count each block:\n\n- 1-100: 80-89 \u2192 10 eights\n- 101-200: 180-189 \u2192 10 eights\n- 201-300: 280-289 \u2192 10 eights\n- 301-400: 380-389 \u2192 10 eights\n- 401-488: 480-488 \u2192 how many eights here? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so the tens digit is 8 for all of these, so 9 eights.\n\nWait, but each block before that had 10 eights, so 4 blocks before 400, each contributing 10, and then in 480-488, it's 9 eights. So, total tens place eights are 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so yes, 9 eights in the tens place for that partial block. So, total tens place 8's are 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's are 0.\n\nSo, total 8's are units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, so 4's total to 188 and 8's total to 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me go through each digit place again for both 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with 4:\n\nUnits place: Every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8. So, 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), does 484 exist? Yes, so 1 more. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nTens place: For 4, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 10 each, 50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89. Correct. Total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow for 8:\n\nUnits place: Same as 4, 48 full blocks, 48, plus in the last 8 numbers, 488 is there, so 1 more. So, 49. Correct.\n\nTens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: None, since 800-899 is beyond 488. So, 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for 4 is 89, but let me check: from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights there.\n\nSo, yes, the calculations seem correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to 8's. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze the occurrence of each digit (4 and 8) in the units, tens, and hundreds places across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\n**For the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490) each contribute one 4, totaling 48. The last partial decade (481-488) includes 484, adding one more, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449, each contributing 10 instances, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, contributing 89 instances.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**For the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** Similar to 4, 48 full decades contribute 48 instances, and the partial decade includes 488, adding one more, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and 480-488 contributes 9, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers fall in 800-899, so 0 instances.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, 488 is a three-digit number, so the page numbers go from 1 up to 488. \n\nI guess the best way to approach this is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Then, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). In each full block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial block, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once in this partial block as well, at 484. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. For the tens digit, every 100 numbers, the digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. How many full blocks of 100 are there in 488? That's 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial block from 401-488.\n\nIn each full block, 10 times, so 4 blocks give 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, the partial block from 401-488. Let's see, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here. From 401 to 488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490, but we only go up to 488. So, the tens digit is 8 in 481-488, but we're looking for 4's. Wait, actually, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0 in 401-410, 1 in 411-420, 2 in 421-430, 3 in 431-440, 4 in 441-450, 5 in 451-460, 6 in 461-470, 7 in 471-480, and 8 in 481-488. So, the tens digit is 4 only in 441-450. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, in the partial block, we have 10 more 4's in the tens place. So total 4's in the tens place would be 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since our book ends at 488, it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 = 88, but since we include both endpoints, it's 89 numbers. So, yes, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's are 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks and 8 extra numbers.\n\nIn each full block, 1 time, so 48 times. In the last partial block, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once at 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. For the tens digit, every 100 numbers, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, in each block of 100, 10 times the digit 8 appears in the tens place. There are 4 full blocks (1-100, etc.), so 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, the partial block from 401-488. Let's see, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0 in 401-410, 1 in 411-420, ..., 8 in 481-490, but our book ends at 488, so 481-488. So, the tens digit is 8 in 481-488, which is 8 numbers (481 to 488). Wait, no, 481 to 488 is 8 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in each of these. So, that's 8 times. So, in the partial block, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times.\n\nWait, but actually, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, no, 480 is included, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's 9 times. Hmm, but wait, 480 is in the partial block, right? Because the partial block starts at 401, so 480 is within 401-488. So, the tens digit is 8 from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the partial block was 401-488, so 480 is included. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the partial block. So, total tens place 8's: 40 (from full blocks) + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the hundreds place contributes 0 to the count of 8's.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times. So, yes, 40 + 9 = 49 in the tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 188 and 8's were 98, so the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me go through the 4's again. Units place: 48 full blocks (1-480) with 48 4's, and then 484 in the last 8 numbers, so 49 total. Tens place: 4 full blocks (1-400) with 10 each, so 40, and then from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more, making 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's: units place, 48 full blocks (1-480) with 48 8's, and then 488, so 49. Tens place: 4 full blocks (1-400) with 10 each, so 40, and then from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more, making 49. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those, so 89 times. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems right.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** Every 10 numbers, '4' appears once. There are 48 full decades (1-480) contributing 48 '4's. In 481-488, '4' appears once at 484. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens place:** Every 100 numbers, '4' appears 10 times in the tens place. Four full centuries (1-400) contribute 40 '4's. In 401-488, '4' appears in 441-450, contributing 10. Total: 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, '4' appears 89 times. Total: 89.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** Every 10 numbers, '8' appears once. 48 full decades contribute 48 '8's. In 481-488, '8' appears once at 488. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens place:** Every 100 numbers, '8' appears 10 times. Four full centuries contribute 40 '8's. In 401-488, '8' appears in 480-488, contributing 9. Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** '8' does not appear as the hundreds digit in 1-488. Total: 0.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's than '8's printed in the book.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, 488 is a three-digit number, so page numbers go up to three digits. Let me think about how to count the number of times the digits 4 and 8 appear in each place: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nMaybe I should handle each digit place separately. Let's start with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in a sequence of numbers, right? So for every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit appears once in the units place. But wait, does this hold true all the way up to 488? I think so, except possibly the last set if 488 isn't a multiple of 10. Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. So for the units place, the digit 4 will appear 48 times (once in each group of 10) plus one more time in the last partial group if 484 is included. Wait, 484 is within 481 to 488, so yes, units digit 4 appears 49 times. Similarly, the digit 8 in the units place will appear 48 times plus one more if 488 is included, which it is. So 8 appears 49 times in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each block of 100. So for 488 pages, how many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So for 4 full hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 times each digit appears in the tens place. Now, we have the last partial hundred from 401 to 488. Let me check how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. From 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So for 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420 is 1; 421-430 is 2; 431-440 is 3; 441-450 is 4; 451-460 is 5; 461-470 is 6; 471-480 is 7; and 481-488 is 8. So in the last partial hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers (481-488). So the digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place in this partial hundred. Therefore, total for the tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) + 8 = 48 times for 8, and for 4, in the tens place, it's 40 times because in the last partial hundred, 4 doesn't appear in the tens place (since 441-450 is 4 in the hundreds place, but tens digit is 4 only in 441-450, which is 10 times, but wait, no, that's the hundreds place. Wait, no, 441-450 has tens digit 4, right? So in the last partial hundred, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 441-450, which is 10 numbers. So actually, in the tens place, digit 4 appears 10 times in the last partial hundred. So total for 4 in tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 times. Wait, but wait, 488 is the last page, so does 441-450 fall within 401-488? Yes, because 450 is less than 488. So 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in the last partial hundred. So total for 4 in tens place is 40 + 10 = 50, and for 8, it's 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in the tens place, each full hundred gives 10 times each digit, so 4 full hundreds give 40 each. Then in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So for 4, the tens digit is 4 in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. For 8, the tens digit is 8 in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 numbers (481-488). So yes, 8 times. So total for 4 in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, and for 8: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, 400-488 is part of the hundreds digit 4. So let's see: hundreds digit is 1 from 1-99 (99 pages), 2 from 100-199 (100 pages), 3 from 200-299 (100 pages), and 4 from 300-488. Wait, 300-488 is 189 pages (since 488 - 300 + 1 = 189). So how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Wait, no, 300-399 is 100 pages, so 300-399 would have hundreds digit 3, and 400-488 is hundreds digit 4, which is 89 pages. So the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is either 1, 2, 3, or 4. So 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all.\n\nSo now, let's sum up the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each place.\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal for 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 48 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal for 8: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97 times.\n\nSo the difference is 188 - 97 = 91. Therefore, there are 91 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place:\n- For 4: Each 10 numbers, 4 appears once. There are 48 full tens (since 488 / 10 = 48.8), so 48 times, plus in the last partial ten (481-488), 484 is included, so that's one more, making 49.\n- For 8: Similarly, 48 full tens, plus 488, so 49.\n\nTens place:\n- For 4: Each hundred has 10 occurrences in the tens place. 4 full hundreds = 40. In the last partial hundred (401-488), 441-450 is 10 numbers, so 10 more, total 50.\n- For 8: Each hundred has 10 occurrences, but in the last partial hundred, 481-488 is 8 numbers, so 8 more, total 48.\n\nHundreds place:\n- For 4: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n- For 8: Never, so 0.\n\nAdding up:\n4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **4's:** Each 10 numbers contribute one '4' in the units place. With 48 full groups of 10 (480 numbers), there are 48 '4's. The last 8 numbers (481-488) include 484, adding one more '4', totaling 49.\n   - **8's:** Similarly, there are 48 '8's in the units place from the full groups, plus 488 adds one more, totaling 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - **4's:** Each hundred contributes 10 '4's in the tens place. For 4 full hundreds, that's 40 '4's. In the last partial hundred (401-488), 441-450 adds 10 more '4's, totaling 50.\n   - **8's:** Each hundred contributes 10 '8's, but in the last partial hundred, only 481-488 adds 8 '8's, totaling 48.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **4's:** Pages 400-488 have '4' in the hundreds place, totaling 89 times.\n   - **8's:** No page numbers have '8' in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 97 = 91\n\n**Answer:** There are 91 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider the digits in the units place, tens place, and hundreds place separately.\n\nLet me start by understanding the range of page numbers. The book has 488 pages, so the page numbers go from 1 to 488. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times 8 appears, then subtract the two counts to find the difference.\n\nI think the best approach is to analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits 4 and 8. Let's start with the digit 4.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of times 4 appears in the units place. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So there are 48 complete groups of 10 and an extra 8 numbers. In each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.). So that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (484). So total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each cycle of 100 has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 4 (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.). How many complete hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). So that's 4 times 10, which is 40. Now, the remaining 88 pages are from 401 to 488. In this range, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449. That's 10 more times. So total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. How many pages is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So there are 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4, the units digit cycles every 10. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups of 10 and 8 extra numbers. Each group contributes one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 8 appears once more (488). So total 8's in units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The tens digit cycles every 100. Each cycle has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 8 (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are 4 complete hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, that's 9 pages (480-488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 occurrences. So total 8's in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 full decades + 1 in the last partial decade (484) \u2192 49\n- Tens: 4 full centuries (40 each) + 10 in 440-449 \u2192 50\n- Hundreds: 89 (400-488)\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full decades + 1 in the last partial decade (488) \u2192 49\n- Tens: 4 full centuries (40 each) + 9 in 480-488 \u2192 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. That also seems correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me try to categorize them.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers, that's from 1 to 9. In this range, the digits are just 1 through 9, so each digit appears exactly once. So, for single-digit pages, the number of 4's is 1, and the number of 8's is also 1. That means, in this range, 4's and 8's are equal.\n\nNext, let's move on to two-digit page numbers, which go from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I think I should calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place separately.\n\nStarting with the tens place for two-digit numbers: The tens digit can be 1 through 9. For each tens digit, the units digit goes from 0 to 9. So, for the tens place, each digit from 1 to 9 appears 10 times (once for each units digit). So, for 4 in the tens place, that's 10 times, and similarly, 8 in the tens place is also 10 times.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers: For each tens digit (1 to 9), the units digit cycles through 0 to 9. So, for each tens digit, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. Since there are 9 tens digits, that's 9 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place.\n\nAdding up the two-digit numbers: 4 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times, and 8 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times. So, again, they're equal in two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which go from 100 to 488. This is where it gets a bit more complex because the range isn't a full hundred. Let's break it down into hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book has 488 pages. So, from 100 to 199, 200 to 299, 300 to 399, and 400 to 488.\n\nLet's calculate how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, how about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the hundreds digit only goes up to 4, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8's count here is 0.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. Let's consider each hundred separately.\n\nFrom 100 to 199: The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each hundred. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (for pages 140-149), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (for pages 180-189).\n\nSame goes for 200-299 and 300-399. Each of these hundreds will have 10 occurrences of 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, for 400-488: The tens digit here goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for 4 in the tens place, we have pages 440-449, which is 10 pages. For 8 in the tens place, we have pages 480-488. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so how many pages is that? From 480 to 488 is 9 pages, right? Because 488 - 480 = 8, but including both endpoints, that's 9 pages. So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here.\n\nSo, adding up the tens place for three-digit numbers:\n\n- For 4: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-449) = 40 times.\n- For 8: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (480-488) = 39 times.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Each hundred from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399 has 10 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place. So that's 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30 each. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total for 4 in tens place is 30 + 10 = 40, and for 8, it's 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nOkay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's move on to the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, we'll consider each hundred separately.\n\nFrom 100-199: The units digit cycles from 0-9 for each tens digit. So, for each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the units place, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\nSame applies to 200-299 and 300-399. Each contributes 10 times for 4 and 8 in the units place.\n\nNow, for 400-488: The units digit cycles from 0-9 for each tens digit. But since we're only going up to 488, we need to check if all units digits are present.\n\nWait, 400-488: The tens digit goes from 0 to 8. For each tens digit, the units digit goes from 0 to 9, except for the last tens digit, which is 8, where the units digit only goes up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for the units digit:\n\nFor 4 in the units place: Each tens digit from 0 to 8 will have a units digit of 4, so that's 9 times (from 404, 414, ..., 484). Wait, actually, 400-488 includes 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the units place: Each tens digit from 0 to 8 will have a units digit of 8, except for the last one where it's only up to 488. So, from 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 times as well.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so that's correct. So, both 4 and 8 appear 9 times in the units place for 400-488.\n\nSo, adding up the units place for three-digit numbers:\n\n- For 4: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n- For 8: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because from 400-488, the units digit for 4 is 9 times, and same for 8. So, adding up:\n\n- 4: 3\u00d710 + 9 = 39\n- 8: 3\u00d710 + 9 = 39\n\nOkay, so both 4 and 8 appear 39 times in the units place for three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, let me sum up all the occurrences for 4 and 8 across all digit places.\n\nStarting with 4:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: hundreds place: 89, tens place: 40, units place: 39\nTotal for 4: 1 + 19 + 89 + 40 + 39\n\nWait, no, I think I'm mixing up the places. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, no, in the three-digit numbers, I've already broken down the hundreds, tens, and units separately. So, for three-digit numbers, 4 appears:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\n- Tens place: 40 times\n- Units place: 39 times\n\nSo, total for 4 in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\n- Tens place: 39 times\n- Units place: 39 times\nTotal for 8 in three-digit numbers: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78 times.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Earlier, I had:\n\nIn three-digit numbers:\n\n- For 4: hundreds=89, tens=40, units=39. Total=89+40+39=168\n- For 8: hundreds=0, tens=39, units=39. Total=0+39+39=78\n\nBut wait, earlier when I was calculating the tens place for three-digit numbers, I had 4 appearing 40 times and 8 appearing 39 times. Similarly, in the units place, both appeared 39 times. So, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's add the single-digit and two-digit numbers.\n\nSingle-digit:\n\n- 4: 1\n- 8: 1\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- 4: 19\n- 8: 19\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- 4: 168\n- 8: 78\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me verify each step.\n\nSingle-digit: 1-9, so 4 once, 8 once.\n\nTwo-digit: From 10-99.\n\nFor tens place: 10 times each for 4 and 8.\n\nFor units place: 9 times each for 4 and 8.\n\nSo, 10 + 9 = 19 each. So, 4:19, 8:19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears in 400-488: 89 times.\n\n8 never appears in hundreds place.\n\nTens place:\n\nFrom 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: 10 each for 4 and 8 in tens place. So, 3\u00d710=30 each.\n\nIn 400-488: 4 in tens place appears 10 times (440-449), 8 in tens place appears 9 times (480-488). So, 30 +10=40 for 4, 30 +9=39 for 8.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFrom 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: 10 each for 4 and 8 in units place. So, 3\u00d710=30 each.\n\nIn 400-488: 4 in units place appears 9 times (404,414,...,484), 8 in units place appears 9 times (408,418,...,488). So, 30 +9=39 each.\n\nSo, total for 4 in three-digit numbers: 89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (units) = 168\n\nTotal for 8 in three-digit numbers: 0 (hundreds) +39 (tens) +39 (units) =78\n\nNow, adding single and two-digit:\n\nTotal 4's: 1 +19 +168= 188\n\nTotal 8's:1 +19 +78=98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 188 -98 is indeed 90. But let me think if I've counted correctly.\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, for the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, which is correct because from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears 40 times, which is 3 hundreds \u00d710 +10 in 400-488. That seems correct.\n\nIn the units place, 4 appears 39 times, which is 3 hundreds \u00d710 +9 in 400-488. Correct.\n\nSimilarly for 8, in tens place: 3\u00d710 +9=39\n\nUnits place: 3\u00d710 +9=39\n\nSo, 39+39=78 for 8 in three-digit.\n\nAdding single and two-digit:\n\n4:1+19=20; 20+168=188\n\n8:1+19=20; 20+78=98\n\n188-98=90\n\nWait, but 90 seems like a lot. Let me see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position separately across all pages from 1 to 488.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nFirst, let's consider the units place.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nWell, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete decades are there? 488 /10=48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last number, which is 48\u00d710 +8, so the last 4 in units place is at 484, which is within the 48th decade (480-489). So, 48 times.\n\nSimilarly, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Same logic: 48 times, since 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so in the 48th decade, 488 is the last number, so 8 appears in units place at 488, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times each.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 39 times in three-digit numbers for units place, plus 1 in single-digit and 9 in two-digit. Let me check that.\n\nWait, no, when I broke it down before, I had:\n\n- Single-digit: 1 (4)\n- Two-digit: 9 (units place for 4)\n- Three-digit: 39 (units place for 4)\nSo, total 1 +9 +39=49 times for 4 in units place.\n\nWait, that contradicts the other approach where I thought it's 48 times. Hmm, so which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach. Let me recount.\n\nIn the units place:\n\nFrom 1-9: 4 appears once (at 4)\nFrom 10-99: For each ten (10-19, 20-29, ...,90-99), 4 appears once in the units place, so 9 times.\nFrom 100-488: For each hundred, 10 times per hundred for units digit 4, so 3\u00d710=30. Plus, in 400-488, the units digit 4 appears 9 times (404,414,...,484). So, 30 +9=39.\n\nWait, but from 100-488, that's 3 full hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 400-488. So, 3\u00d710=30, plus 9 in 400-488, total 39.\n\nSo, units place for 4: 1 (single-digit) +9 (two-digit) +39 (three-digit) =49.\n\nSimilarly, units place for 8: 1 (single-digit) +9 (two-digit) +39 (three-digit) =49.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did the per-decade count, I thought it was 48 times for 4 and 48 times for 8. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nIt's the number of times 4 is the last digit. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there?\n\nThe sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The nth term is 10n -6, where n starts at 1.\n\nWait, let me find n such that 10n -6 \u2264488.\n\nWait, 10n \u2264494 \u2192 n \u226449.4, so n=49. So, 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in units place: 8,18,28,...,488. The nth term is 10n -2.\n\n10n -2 \u2264488 \u219210n \u2264490 \u2192n=49. So, 49 times.\n\nSo, units place: 49 each.\n\nBut in my earlier breakdown, I had 49 for 4 and 49 for 8, but when I added single, two, and three-digit counts, I had 49 each. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach where I thought units place for 4 was 39 in three-digit numbers. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, in three-digit numbers, from 100-488, the units digit 4 appears 39 times. But from 1-99, units digit 4 appears 10 times (4,14,24,...,94). So, 10 times in single and two-digit, plus 39 in three-digit, total 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8: 10 times in single and two-digit, plus 39 in three-digit, total 49.\n\nSo, units place: both 4 and 8 appear 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, how many times does 4 appear?\n\nFrom 1-99: In each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9. So, for 4 in the tens place, it's 10 times per hundred. From 1-99, that's 10 times (40-49).\n\nFrom 100-488: The tens digit cycles 0-9 for each hundred. So, for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: each contributes 10 times for 4 in the tens place. That's 3\u00d710=30.\n\nIn 400-488: The tens digit goes from 0-8. So, 4 in the tens place is at 440-449, which is 10 times.\n\nSo, total for 4 in tens place: 10 (1-99) +30 (100-399) +10 (400-488) =50 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place:\n\nFrom 1-99: 10 times (80-89)\n\nFrom 100-399: 3\u00d710=30 times\n\nIn 400-488: 8 in the tens place is from 480-488, which is 9 times (since 488 is the last page). So, 9 times.\n\nSo, total for 8 in tens place:10 +30 +9=49 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought in three-digit numbers, 4 in tens place was 40 times, which included 30 from 100-399 and 10 from 400-488, totaling 40. Then, adding the 10 from 1-99, that's 50. So, yes, 50 times for 4 in tens place.\n\nSimilarly, 8 in tens place: 10 (1-99) +30 (100-399) +9 (400-488)=49.\n\nSo, tens place: 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, hundreds place.\n\nFrom 1-99: No hundreds digit, so 0.\n\nFrom 100-488: Hundreds digit is 1,2,3,4.\n\nFor 4 in hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nFor 8 in hundreds place: Since the book only goes up to 488, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the occurrences:\n\nFor 4:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50+89=188\n\nFor 8:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49+0=98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, so according to this, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. But earlier, when I thought about the units place, I thought maybe I had a mistake, but it seems consistent now.\n\nWait, but let me cross-verify. Another way to calculate the number of times a digit appears is to consider each digit position separately.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nAs before, it's 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nTens place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nAs calculated, 50 times.\n\n8 appears 49 times.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm including page 488 correctly.\n\nIn the tens place, for 400-488, 8 in the tens place is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, 488 is included as an 8 in units place, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times because 400-488 is 89 pages, which is correct.\n\nI think this makes sense. So, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Single-Digit Pages (1-9):**\n   - Both '4' and '8' appear once.\n\n2. **Two-Digit Pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens Place:** Each digit (0-9) appears 10 times. So, '4' and '8' each appear 10 times.\n   - **Units Place:** Each digit appears 9 times (since for each ten, the units digit cycles through 0-9, but we exclude the tens place count). So, '4' and '8' each appear 9 times.\n   - **Total for Two-Digit Pages:** \n     - '4': 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n     - '8': 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n\n3. **Three-Digit Pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - '4' appears in pages 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n     - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - For hundreds 100-399: Each contributes 10 times for '4' and '8'.\n     - For 400-488: '4' appears 10 times (440-449), '8' appears 9 times (480-488).\n     - **Total:**\n       - '4': 3\u00d710 +10 =40\n       - '8': 3\u00d710 +9=39\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - For hundreds 100-399: Each contributes 10 times for '4' and '8'.\n     - For 400-488: '4' and '8' each appear 9 times.\n     - **Total:**\n       - '4': 3\u00d710 +9=39\n       - '8': 3\u00d710 +9=39\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **'4':** 1 (single) +19 (two-digit) +89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (units) =188\n   - **'8':** 1 (single) +19 (two-digit) +0 (hundreds) +39 (tens) +39 (units) =98\n\n5. **Difference:** 188 (number of '4's) -98 (number of '8's) =90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 pages, the digits 0 through 9 appear once each in the units place. So, from page 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra pages. In each set of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears once. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 times 1, which is 48, plus maybe one more if the last 8 pages include a 4 in the units place. Wait, the last 8 pages are 481 to 488, so the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears once more (page 484), making the total 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once in each set of 10, so 48 times 1 is 48, plus one more in the last set (page 488), so 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, both 4's and 8's appear 49 times each. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nNext, the tens place: Here, the digits cycle every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages more (401-488). In each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 times 10 = 40 for both 4's and 8's. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in the tens place, how many 4's and 8's are there? Let's see, pages 440-449 have a tens digit of 4, which is 10 pages, so that's 10 occurrences of 4. Similarly, pages 480-488 have a tens digit of 8, which is 9 pages (since 488 is the end). So, that's 9 occurrences of 8. So, in the tens place, 4's contribute 10 and 8's contribute 9. Therefore, total in the tens place: 40 (from hundreds) + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's. So, the difference in the tens place is 50 - 49 = 1.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. Each digit appears 100 times in the hundreds place for each hundred. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so no contribution. From 100-199, hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's. From 200-299, hundreds digit is 2, again no 4's or 8's. From 300-399, hundreds digit is 3, same thing. From 400-488, hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 pages (400-488 inclusive). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times, and the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8's in the hundreds place are 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences of 4's and 8's across all digit places.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place:\n- 48 complete sets of 10: 48*1=48 for both 4 and 8.\n- Last 8 pages: pages 481-488. Units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488). So, units place total 4's: 48+1=49, 8's: 48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n- 4 hundreds: 4*10=40 each.\n- Last 88 pages: 401-488.\n- Tens digits: 0-8.\n- 4's in tens place: 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 occurrences.\n- 8's in tens place: 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 occurrences.\n- So, total tens place: 4's=40+10=50, 8's=40+9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- Only 400-488 have hundreds digit 4, which is 89 pages.\n- So, 89 4's, 0 8's. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nI think that's correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, 488 is a three-digit number, so the page numbers go from 1 up to 488. \n\nI guess I should analyze the digits in each place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Maybe I can count how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and do the same for 8, then find the difference. That sounds like a plan.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears once, and so does the digit 8. But I need to check if this pattern holds throughout the entire range up to 488.\n\nLet me see, from 1 to 480, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 480 divided by 10 is 48. So there are 48 complete groups. Each group contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So that's 48 times each. But wait, from 1 to 480, the units digit cycles 48 times, right? So 48 4's and 48 8's in the units place.\n\nBut wait, the book goes up to 488, so there are 8 more pages: 481 to 488. Let me check the units digits in these. From 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So in this range, the units digit 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So in total, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 4's and 48 + 1 = 49 8's. Hmm, so in the units place, they are equal. That's interesting.\n\nNow moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So in each hundred, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So for 488 pages, how many complete hundreds do we have? Let's see, 400 pages would be four complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Then we have 88 pages left (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So for four complete hundreds, that's 4 times 10, so 40 4's and 40 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), I need to check the tens digit. Let's break this down. From 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, it's 1; 421-430, it's 2; 431-440, it's 3; 441-450, it's 4; 451-460, it's 5; 461-470, it's 6; 471-480, it's 7; and 481-488, it's 8.\n\nWait, so in the 401-488 range, the tens digit cycles through 0-8, but only up to 488. Let me count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nLooking at 401-488, the tens digits are as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 numbers)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10 numbers)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10 numbers)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10 numbers)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 numbers)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10 numbers)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10 numbers)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10 numbers)\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 numbers)\n\nSo in the tens place for 401-488, the digit 4 appears once in 441-450, which is 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 8 times.\n\nWait, no, actually, the tens digit is the second digit from the right. So in 441-450, the tens digit is 4, so that's 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. Similarly, in 481-488, the tens digit is 8, but there are only 8 numbers (481-488), so the tens digit 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo in the tens place, from 401-488, we have 10 4's and 8 8's. Therefore, adding to the previous 40 each from the complete hundreds, the total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 4's and 40 + 8 = 48 8's.\n\nSo in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 48 times. That's a difference of 2 more 4's than 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is the first digit from the left. In a 488-page book, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for pages 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), or 4 (400-488).\n\nSo let's count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place.\n\nFor 4's in the hundreds place: pages 400-488. That's 89 pages (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers.\n\nFor 8's in the hundreds place: pages 800-899. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with hundreds digit 8. Therefore, 8's in the hundreds place appear 0 times.\n\nSo in the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times and 8's appear 0 times. That's a difference of 89 more 4's than 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nNow for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So subtract the total 8's from total 4's: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- From 1 to 480: 48 groups of 10, so 48 4's and 48 8's.\n- From 481-488: units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n- Total units: 48 + 1 = 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Complete hundreds (1-400): 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So 4*10=40 each.\n- From 401-488: tens digits as 0-8. For 4's, 441-450: 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n- For 8's, 481-488: 8 numbers, so 8 8's.\n- So total tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 4's and 40 + 8 = 48 8's. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n- 8's: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488. So 0 8's.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the hundreds place would contribute more, but let me check again.\n\nWait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct. So 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems right.\n\nAnd 8's in hundreds place: 0, correct.\n\nUnits and tens places seem correctly calculated.\n\nSo yes, 188 - 97 = 91. So there are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I calculated the units place, from 1 to 488, how many times does each digit appear in the units place? For each digit 0-9, it appears the same number of times, except possibly the last partial group.\n\nWait, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, and 8 extra numbers.\n\nIn each complete group of 10, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. So for 48 groups, each digit appears 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so digits 1-8 appear once each, and 9 and 0 don't appear.\n\nSo for the units place, digit 4 appears 48 times (from the complete groups) plus once in the remaining 8, totaling 49. Similarly, digit 8 appears 48 times plus once, totaling 49. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, as calculated earlier, from 1-400, 40 times each. Then from 401-488, 10 times for 4 and 8 times for 8. So 50 and 48. That adds up.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 89 times for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me recount that.\n\nFrom 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's.\n100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's.\n200-299: hundreds digit is 2, so no 4's or 8's.\n300-399: hundreds digit is 3, so no 4's or 8's.\n400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). So 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nAnd 800-899 would be hundreds digit 8, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo yes, 89 4's and 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo adding up, 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nI think that's correct. So the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - From 1 to 480: 48 complete groups of 10, contributing 48 '4's and 48 '8's.\n   - Pages 481-488: Units digits 1-8, adding 1 '4' (at 484) and 1 '8' (at 488).\n   - Total: 49 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - From 1 to 400: 400/100 = 4 groups, contributing 40 '4's and 40 '8's.\n   - Pages 401-488: Tens digits cycle through 0-8. \n     - '4' appears 10 times (441-450).\n     - '8' appears 8 times (481-488).\n   - Total: 50 '4's and 48 '8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 1-399: Hundreds digit is 0-3, no '4's or '8's.\n   - Pages 400-488: Hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times.\n   - Total: 89 '4's and 0 '8's.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - '8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 '4's - 97 '8's = 91.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe digit '4' is printed 91 more times than the digit '8'.  \n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Wait, 488 is a three-digit number, so the page numbers go from 1 to 488. That means I need to check all three-digit, two-digit, and single-digit page numbers for the digits 4 and 8.\n\nLet me start by thinking about how digits are counted in page numbers. For each digit place\u2014units, tens, hundreds\u2014I should calculate how many times 4 appears and how many times 8 appears. Then I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's handle the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each set of ten numbers. So, in every block of ten pages, each digit appears once in the units place. For example, pages 1-10 have 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0 in the units place. So, in each block of ten, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks of ten and then 8 extra pages (481 to 488). In each complete block, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 blocks would have 48 4's and 48 8's from the units place.\n\nNow, looking at the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, we have a 4 in page 484 and an 8 in page 488. So that's one more 4 and one more 8 in the units place. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49, and units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that's the same, so the difference here is zero.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. Wait, 488 pages mean the last page is 488, so the units digits from 481 to 488 are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So yes, 484 has a 4 and 488 has an 8. So units place 4's are 49, 8's are 49. So no difference there.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, etc., up to 9 for 90-99. So, in each hundred, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49 in each hundred), and the digit 8 appears 10 times as well (e.g., 80-89 in each hundred). So, for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 4's and 4 * 10 = 40 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the remaining 88 pages are from 401 to 488. Let's see how the tens digit behaves here. Pages 401-409: tens digit is 0. 410-419: tens digit is 1. 420-429: tens digit is 2. 430-439: tens digit is 3. 440-449: tens digit is 4. 450-459: tens digit is 5. 460-469: tens digit is 6. 470-479: tens digit is 7. 480-488: tens digit is 8.\n\nSo, in the tens place, how many 4's and 8's do we have here? Let's count:\n\n- Tens digit 4: 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 4's.\n- Tens digit 8: 480-488, which is 9 pages (since 488 is the last page), so 9 8's.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 pages, right? Because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in this last partial hundred.\n\nSo, in the tens place, from 401-488, we have 10 4's and 9 8's.\n\nTherefore, total tens place 4's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 = 50.\nTotal tens place 8's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, there are 50 4's and 49 8's. That gives a difference of 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only non-zero from page 100 onwards. Let's see:\n\n- Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's here.\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's.\n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, same.\n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, same.\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears from page 400 to 488. How many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, meaning 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nThe digit 8 in the hundreds place would be pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, hundreds place: 89 4's and 0 8's. So, a difference of 89 more 4's than 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each digit place:\n\n- Units place: 49 4's, 49 8's. Difference: 0.\n- Tens place: 50 4's, 49 8's. Difference: +1.\n- Hundreds place: 89 4's, 0 8's. Difference: +89.\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, so that means there are 90 more 4's than 8's in all the page numbers.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems a bit high. Let me go through each digit place again.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nTotal number of units digits: 488 pages, so 488 digits in units place.\n\nEach digit from 0-9 appears equally, so 488 / 10 = 48.8 times each. But since we can't have a fraction, we have to consider complete cycles.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to calculate how many times each digit appears in units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use a formula or a systematic approach.\n\nWait, another approach is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each place.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nNumber of complete cycles of 10 in 488 is 48, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So total units 4's: 48 * 1 + 1 = 49. Units 8's: 48 * 1 + 1 = 49. So, difference is 0.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of complete cycles of 100 in 488 is 4 (since 4*100=400). Each complete cycle contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 for each digit.\n\nNow, the remaining pages are 401-488, which is 88 pages. Let's see how the tens digit behaves here.\n\nFrom 401-409: tens digit is 0 (9 pages)\n410-419: tens digit 1 (10 pages)\n420-429: tens digit 2 (10 pages)\n430-439: tens digit 3 (10 pages)\n440-449: tens digit 4 (10 pages)\n450-459: tens digit 5 (10 pages)\n460-469: tens digit 6 (10 pages)\n470-479: tens digit 7 (10 pages)\n480-488: tens digit 8 (9 pages)\n\nSo, in the tens place in 401-488:\n\n- 4 appears in 440-449: 10 times\n- 8 appears in 480-488: 9 times\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\nTotal tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\nDifference: +1\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit is 4. Number of pages: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's.\n8's in hundreds place: 0\nDifference: +89\n\nAdding up the differences: 0 (units) +1 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 90.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me verify the counts again.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- Each 10 pages, 1 4 and 1 8 in units.\n- 488 pages: 48 full tens, so 48 4's and 48 8's.\n- Remaining 8 pages: 481-488. Units digits: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, one 4 and one 8.\n- Total units 4's: 48 +1=49\n- Total units 8's: 48 +1=49\n- Difference: 0\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each 100 pages: 10 4's and 10 8's in tens.\n- 488 pages: 4 full hundreds, so 4*10=40 each.\n- Remaining 88 pages: 401-488\n- Tens digits: as above, 10 4's and 9 8's\n- Total tens 4's: 40 +10=50\n- Total tens 8's: 40 +9=49\n- Difference: +1\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- From 400-488: 89 pages with hundreds digit 4\n- So, 89 4's\n- 0 8's\n- Difference: +89\n\nTotal difference: 0 +1 +89=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - 488 pages = 48 full tens + 8 extra pages.\n   - 48 full tens contribute 48 4's and 48 8's.\n   - Extra 8 pages (481-488) add 1 4 and 1 8.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Difference: 0\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - 488 pages = 4 full hundreds + 88 extra pages.\n   - 4 full hundreds contribute 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - Extra 88 pages (401-488) add 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n   - Difference: +1\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have hundreds digit 4.\n   - 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages.\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n   - Difference: +89\n\n**Total Difference:**\n- Units: 0\n- Tens: +1\n- Hundreds: +89\n- **Total:** 0 + 1 + 89 = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, 488 is a three-digit number, so pages go from 1 to 488. So, I guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for the digit 8, then subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll handle each digit place one by one for both 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in a range of numbers. Since the book has 488 pages, the units digit cycles every 10 pages. So, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete groups and then 8 extra pages. In each group of 10, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in the units place. So, for the digit 4, it appears 48 times in the units place, plus one more time in the remaining 8 pages if the 4 is within those. Wait, the remaining pages after 48 groups of 10 would be from 481 to 488, right? So, the units digits in these would be 1 through 8. Since 4 is within 1-8, the digit 4 appears once more in the units place. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, it would also appear 48 times, but in the remaining 8 pages, 8 is included, so that's another 1. So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49 as well. Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking how many more 4's than 8's, so maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, when I have 488 pages, the units digit cycles 48 full times (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490). Wait, no, 488 is less than 490, so actually, the last group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in each group of 10, the units digit 4 appears once, so 48 times. Then, in the last 8 pages, 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once more, making it 49. Similarly, for 8 in the units place, in each group of 10, 8 appears once, so 48 times, and in the last 8 pages, 8 appears once as 488, so total 49. So, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place. So, no difference there.\n\nMoving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in a block of 100 pages. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (1-9), 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), etc., up to 9 (90-99). So, for each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. Now, since we have 488 pages, that's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nSo, for the tens digit, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 times. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see, 401-410: tens digit is 0, 411-420: tens digit is 1, 421-430: tens digit is 2, 431-440: tens digit is 3, 441-450: tens digit is 4, 451-460: tens digit is 5, 461-470: tens digit is 6, 471-480: tens digit is 7, and 481-488: tens digit is 8. So, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit is 4 only once in 441-450, which is 10 pages. So, that's 10 times. Therefore, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place: in each hundred, 8 appears 10 times, so 4 hundreds give 40 times. In the remaining 88 pages, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 8 times. Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 from 480-489, but since we stop at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages, but 480 is included in the previous hundreds. Wait, no, the hundreds part is up to 400, so 401-488. So, 480 is part of 401-488. So, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 pages: 480,481,...,488. Wait, but 480 is actually in the 400s, so when considering the tens place, 480 has a tens digit of 8. So, from 401-488, how many times does the tens digit 8 appear? It's from 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the remaining 88 pages. Therefore, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 481-488 is 8 pages, but actually, 480 is included in the 401-488 range, so 480 is page 480, which is within 401-488, so the tens digit 8 starts at 480, so that's 9 pages (480-488). Therefore, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the remaining pages. So, total 8's in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. The hundreds part is 1-400, so 401-488 is the remaining. So, in 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, yes, 9 times. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, for the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. So, the difference here is 1 more 4 than 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nFor the digit 8 in the hundreds place, since our book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the hundreds digit 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in the hundreds place: 89, and 8's: 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place:\n- 488 / 10 = 48 full groups, each contributing 1 to 4 and 8 in units place. So, 48 each.\n- Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once, 8 appears once.\n- So, units place: 48 +1 =49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 40 for 4 and 40 for 8.\n- Remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n  - For 4 in tens place: occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times.\n  - For 8 in tens place: occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times.\n- So, total tens place: 40 +10=50 for 4, and 40 +9=49 for 8.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears from 400-488: 89 pages.\n- 8 never appears in hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188.\nTotal 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me think again about the tens place in the remaining pages. From 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages, correct. And tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages, correct.\n\nAnd in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, which is from 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488-400+1=89.\n\nSo, yes, I think the calculation is correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting '4's and '8's in Each Digit Place:**\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 full groups).\n     - In the last 8 pages (481-488), both '4' and '8' appear once in the units place.\n     - Total '4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n     - Total '8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   \n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - Each digit appears 10 times per hundred, so 40 times for '4' and '8' in the first 400 pages.\n     - In the remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n       - '4' appears 10 times in the tens place (440-449).\n       - '8' appears 9 times in the tens place (480-488).\n     - Total '4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n     - Total '8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n   \n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - '4' appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n     - '8' never appears in the hundreds place.\n     - Total '4's: 89.\n     - Total '8's: 0.\n\n2. **Summing Up the Counts:**\n   - Total '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - Total '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Difference = Total '4's - Total '8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think about how digits are counted in page numbers.\n\nMaybe I should approach this by looking at each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. The tens digit can be 0 to 9, and the units digit can also be 0 to 9. Wait, but for page numbers less than 100, the hundreds digit is 0, right?\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place one by one.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of times the digit 4 appears in each position.\n\n1. Units place: The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, like 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such numbers are there? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484, which is within 488. So, that would be 48 times? Wait, but 488 is page 488, so the units digit is 8, so the last 4 in units place is indeed 484. So, 48 times.\n\nWait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but actually, the number of 4's in the units place is 48. Because from 1 to 480, there are 480 numbers, which is 48 groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so no additional 4's. So, total 4's in units place: 48.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, the tens digit is 4. So, this occurs in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there? From 0 to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, for each hundred, there's a 40-49 range. So, 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers), 100-199: 140-149 (10), 200-299: 240-249 (10), 300-399: 340-349 (10), and 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, total 50.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, right? 400 is the first, 488 is the last. So, 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. Units place: Similar to 4's, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many 8's in the units place? Let's see, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, 488 is included. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit is 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times.\n\nWait, let me check: from 1 to 480, there are 480 numbers, which is 48 groups of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then from 481 to 488, the units digit 8 occurs once, at 488. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, the tens digit is 8. So, this occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. So, each of these ranges has 10 numbers except the last one, which has only 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 9 numbers. So, let me count:\n\n- 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers)\n- 100-199: 180-189 (10)\n- 200-299: 280-289 (10)\n- 300-399: 380-389 (10)\n- 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers)\n\nSo, that's 4 ranges with 10 numbers each, and one range with 9. So, total 4*10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, correct. Similarly for each hundred. So, 4 ranges of 10, and the last one is 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, the hundreds digit is 8 only in pages 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are no pages with hundreds digit 8. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds: 0. So, 98 total 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought the hundreds place for 8 would be zero, which is correct because the book only goes up to 488, so no page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: 187, total 8's: 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again, because 89 seems a big difference.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the number of 4's in the hundreds place. Let me recount.\n\nFor the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. That seems correct.\n\nFor the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, etc., which is 5 ranges of 10 each, so 50 times. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 times, as calculated earlier.\n\nSo, 89 + 50 + 48 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49 times.\n\nTens place: 49 times.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for 8 would have some, but no, it's zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I overcounted the 4's in the hundreds place. Let me see: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, correct. So, 89 times 4 in hundreds place.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: 400 is page 400, 401, ..., up to 488. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's in the tens place: from 80-89, that's 10, then 180-189, 10, 280-289, 10, 380-389, 10, and 480-488, which is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 49, correct.\n\nSo, 4's: 187, 8's: 98. Difference is 89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 89 seems a big number, but perhaps it's correct.\n\nWait, another way to check: let's consider each digit place separately.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '4' appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 48 full groups of 10 within 480, contributing 48 occurrences. The last group (481-488) doesn't add another '4' in the units place. Total: 48.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '4' appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10 numbers. There are 5 such ranges (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), but the last range only goes up to 488, still contributing 10. Total: 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. Total: 89.\n   - **Total '4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '8' appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 48 full groups of 10 within 480, contributing 48, plus one more at 488. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '8' appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each range contributes 10 numbers, except the last one (480-488), which contributes 9. Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit '8' does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488. Total: 0.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 187\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 187 - 98 = 89\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Wait, since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488, so the highest is a three-digit number, 488. So, I should probably analyze each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nLet me start by thinking about the units place. For every 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and similarly, the digit 8 appears once. So, for the units place, the number of 4's and 8's should be the same, right? But wait, I should check how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488 pages.\n\nSo, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 pages, and then 8 extra pages (481 to 488). In each complete set, the units digit 4 and 8 each appear once. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48, and the number of 8's is also 48. But wait, I have those extra 8 pages from 481 to 488. Let me check the units digits in those. The units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, in the units place, total 4's are 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, they're equal.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 pages. So, in each 100 pages, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and similarly, 8 appears 10 times. Now, how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, 488 is 4*100 + 88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages in the 401-488 range.\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49), and the same for 8 (80-89). So, for each hundred, 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. Since there are 4 complete hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 4's and 4*10 = 40 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, what about the partial hundred from 401 to 488? Let's see, the tens digit in this range goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? Well, the tens digit is 4 in the range 440-449. That's 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 times (since 488 is the last page). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 pages, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 pages. So, in the tens place, from 401-488, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, adding that to the previous counts, total 4's in the tens place would be 40 (from the four hundreds) + 10 = 50, and 8's would be 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. From 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 pages. When the tens digit is 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages because 488 is the last page. So yes, 10 for 4's and 9 for 8's in the tens place for the last partial hundred.\n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place: 4*10 + 10 = 50\nTotal 8's in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 49, so 4's are one more than 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, 400-488 would have a hundreds digit of 4, right? So, the hundreds digit cycles every 100 pages. So, from 1-99, hundreds digit is 0 (if we consider it as three digits), but maybe we don't count leading zeros. Hmm, maybe I should think differently.\n\nWait, in page numbers, the hundreds digit is only present when the page number is 100 or more. So, from 1-99, there is no hundreds digit. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, appearing 100 times. From 200-299, it's 2, appearing 100 times, and so on. But in our case, the book goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Wait, no, 400 to 488 inclusive is 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 appearing 89 times.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place, how many times does 4 appear? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 in all of them, so 89 times. How about 8 in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears zero times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. The hundreds digit is 1 from 100-199, 2 from 200-299, 3 from 300-399, and 4 from 400-488. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place because 800 would be beyond 488. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n- Units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49\n- Tens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 49\n- Hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0\n\nNow, let's sum up the total number of 4's and 8's across all digit places.\n\nTotal 4's = Units (49) + Tens (50) + Hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal 8's = Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, that can't be right because 4's would be 188 and 8's would be 98, so the difference would be 90. But let me check my calculations again because that seems like a big difference.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me go back.\n\nIn the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, how many pages are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in all 89 pages, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. And since the book doesn't go beyond 488, 8 never appears in the hundreds place, so 0 8's there.\n\nIn the tens place, I had 50 4's and 49 8's. Let me check that again. From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 hundreds would give 40 each. Then from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449 (10 pages) and 8 for 480-488 (9 pages). So, 10 + 40 = 50 for 4's and 9 + 40 = 49 for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nIn the units place, I had 49 4's and 49 8's. Let me check that. From 1-488, each 10 pages contribute one 4 and one 8 in the units place. There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 480 pages, so 48 each. Then, from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, 48 + 1 = 49 for both. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: Units (49) + Tens (50) + Hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n8's: Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that I'm double-counting digits? For example, in page numbers like 444, the digit 4 appears three times, so each occurrence is counted in each digit place. But in my calculation, I'm counting each occurrence separately, which is correct. So, 444 would contribute one 4 in units, one in tens, and one in hundreds, so three 4's. Similarly for 488, it's two 8's (tens and units). So, my method of counting each digit place separately and summing them up is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 4's. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. From 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 4's. And 8 in the tens place is from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 8's. So, 10 + 9 = 19 in the tens place for 401-488, but wait, no, I was adding to the previous 40 from the complete hundreds. So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's in tens place, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's in tens place. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the units place. Let me check again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nWell, every 10 pages, 4 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484). So, total 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly for 8's, same logic: 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nSo, the total 4's are 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\nTotal 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, so the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly? Because from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 4's there. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would be 40 each. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449 (10 pages) and 8 in 480-488 (9 pages). So, 10 + 40 = 50 for 4's and 9 + 40 = 49 for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nWait, another way to calculate the number of times a digit appears in a certain place is to use a formula. For example, for the units digit, the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to n is floor(n/10) + something if the last digit is >= d. Similarly for tens and hundreds.\n\nBut maybe I can cross-verify using that method.\n\nLet me try for 4's in the units place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in units place from 1 to 488:\n\nIt's floor(488/10) = 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4. Then, check the remainder: 488 mod 10 = 8. Since 8 >= 4, we add 1 more. So, total 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: floor(488/10) = 48, and 488 mod 10 = 8 >= 8, so add 1. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nFor the tens place, number of times 4 appears:\n\nIt's floor(488/100) * 10 = 4 * 10 = 40. Then, check the last partial hundred: 488 mod 100 = 88. The tens digit in the last partial hundred is 88, so the tens digit goes up to 8. Since 8 >= 4, we check how many times 4 appears in the tens place in 0-88. It's 10 times (40-49). So, total 40 + 10 = 50. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place:\n\nfloor(488/100) * 10 = 4 * 10 = 40. Then, last partial hundred: 488 mod 100 = 88. The tens digit goes up to 8, so how many times does 8 appear in the tens place from 0-88? It's 10 times (80-89). But since 88 is less than 89, we have to adjust. Wait, 80-88 is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, total 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place, number of times 4 appears:\n\nIt's floor(488/1000) * 100 = 0, since 488 < 1000. Then, check the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, 89 times. Correct.\n\nFor 8's in the hundreds place: since 488 < 800, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Correct.\n\nSo, using this formula, I get the same counts as before. So, the total 4's are 49 + 50 + 89 = 188, and 8's are 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a large number. Let me try another approach to verify.\n\nAlternative approach: Instead of counting each digit place separately, maybe I can count all the 4's and 8's in each position across all pages.\n\nBut that's essentially what I did before. Alternatively, perhaps I can list out the counts for each digit place again.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 4's: 49\n- 8's: 49\n\nTens place:\n\n- 4's: 50\n- 8's: 49\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nSo, adding them up:\n\n4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's there. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if 400 is included. Yes, 400 is page 400, so it's included. So, from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 pages. Correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400 to 488, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but 400 to 488 is 89 pages because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct, and the difference is indeed 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Number of complete sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48.\n   - 4's: 48 + 1 (from 484) = 49.\n   - 8's: 48 + 1 (from 488) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Complete hundreds: 4 sets, contributing 10 each.\n   - 4's: 4*10 + 10 (440-449) = 50.\n   - 8's: 4*10 + 9 (480-488) = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears from 400 to 488: 89 times.\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me think about how to approach counting the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each digit place separately.\n\nMaybe I should consider the units place, tens place, and hundreds place separately because the number of times a digit appears can vary depending on its position. Let me start by considering each digit place one by one.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 pages (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then 8 extra pages. In each full block, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for 48 blocks, that's 48 times each. Now, for the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial block, the units digit 4 appears once, and 8 appears once as well. So, adding that, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's, which is also 49. So, in the units place, both digits appear the same number of times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit appears 10 times in a block of 100 pages. For example, from 0-99, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89). So, in each block of 100, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times in the tens place. Now, how many full blocks of 100 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial block from 401-488. In each of these 4 full blocks, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times each. Now, looking at the partial block from 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. Let's see: from 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, it's 1; and so on up to 481-490, which would be tens digit 8, but since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit in 481-488 is 8. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, looking at 401-410, the tens digit is 0, so no 4's there. Similarly, 411-420, tens digit is 1, so no 4's. Wait, but actually, in the tens place, 4 appears only once in each block of 100, right? So, in the partial block from 401-488, does the tens digit ever reach 4? Let me think: 440-449 would have 4 in the tens place, but since 488 is the end, does 440-449 fall within 401-488? Yes, because 440 is greater than 401 and 449 is less than 488. So, in 440-449, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 times. So, that's 10 more times for 4 in the tens place. For 8, in the partial block, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488), but wait, 480-489 would have 10 pages, but since we're stopping at 488, it's 9 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the partial block. So, adding that up, the total for 4 in the tens place is 40 (from the full blocks) + 10 (from the partial block) = 50. For 8, it's 40 + 9 = 49. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, onto the hundreds place. In the hundreds place, each digit from 1 to 4 appears in the hundreds place for 100 pages each. So, 1 appears from 1-100, 2 from 101-200, 3 from 201-300, and 4 from 301-400, 401-488. Wait, actually, 4 in the hundreds place goes from 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. What about 8 in the hundreds place? Since 800-899 would be where 8 appears in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal for 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal for 8: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations because 188 - 98 is indeed 90, but I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the counts.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- 48 full blocks of 10 pages, each contributing 1 four and 1 eight, so 48 each.\n- Remaining 8 pages: 481-488, units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once, 8 appears once.\nTotal units: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- 4 full blocks of 100, each contributing 10 fours and 10 eights, so 40 each.\n- Partial block 401-488: 4 appears 10 times (440-449), 8 appears 9 times (480-488, which is 9 pages). So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8. That adds up.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488), which is correct.\n- 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place, so 0.\n\nAdding up:\n4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, pages 1 to 9 are single-digit, 10 to 99 are two-digit, and 100 to 488 are three-digit. Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nLet me start by counting how many times the digit 4 appears in each place. Then I'll do the same for the digit 8 and find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles through 0 to 9. So, in every block of 10 pages, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once in the units place every 10 numbers.\n\nHow many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and an extra 8 pages (481 to 488). In each of the 48 blocks, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. In the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1 through 8, so the digit 4 doesn't appear here. So, total 4's in the units place: 48.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place: in each block of 10, it appears once, so 48 times. In the extra 8 pages, the units digit 8 appears once (page 488). So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me check. From 1 to 480, that's 48 blocks of 10, so 48 8's in the units place. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1 to 8, so 8 appears once at 488. So yes, total 49 8's in units place.\n\nNow moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in a block of 100. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, in each block of 100, it appears 10 times. Similarly for 8.\n\nHow many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and an extra 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each of the 4 complete blocks, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the extra 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. Let's see, from 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, it's 1; ... up to 481-490, but wait, our last page is 488, so it's up to 488. So, the tens digit in 401-488 is 0 to 8, but each digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which is only 8 times (since 488 is the end). Wait, no, actually, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490), but since we stop at 488, the tens digit 8 only appears in 481-488, which is 8 times (pages 481-488). So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, in the extra 88 pages, does the tens digit ever reach 4? Let's see, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 4, that's pages 441-450. Wait, but 450 is within 401-488, right? So, pages 441-450 have the tens digit as 4, which is 10 pages. So, in the extra 88 pages, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So total 4's in the tens place: 4*10 + 10 = 50 times.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place. In each of the 4 complete blocks, 10 times, so 4*10=40. In the extra 88 pages, the tens digit 8 appears in pages 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 times. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 8 = 48 times.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 481-488, which is 8 pages. So yes, 8 times. So, 40 (from the complete blocks) + 8 = 48.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. For the hundreds digit, each digit from 1 to 4 appears in the hundreds place for certain ranges.\n\nThe digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488. How many times? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So, digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nThe digit 8 appears in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit goes up to 4 (since 400-488). So, the hundreds digit 8 would only appear if the page numbers went up to 800 or higher, which they don't. So, the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nWait, that's correct. So, digit 8 in the hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit.\n\nFor digit 4:\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\nFor digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the total 8's from the total 4's: 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- 4's: 48\n- 8's: 49\n\nTens place:\n- 4's: 50\n- 8's: 48\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nAdding up:\n4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\nDifference: 187 - 97 = 90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But let me verify each part again.\n\nUnits place:\n- From 1 to 488, every 10 pages, 4 appears once in units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 times. But wait, from 1 to 488, the last page is 488, which is the 48th block plus 8 more pages. So, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1-8, so 4 doesn't appear. So, 48 times for 4's in units place. For 8's, in each block of 10, 8 appears once, so 48 times, plus in the last 8 pages, 8 appears once at 488. So, 49 times. That checks out.\n\nTens place:\n- For 4's, in each block of 100, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so 4*10=40. Then, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 pages. So, 40 +10=50. That's correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, in each block of 100, 8 appears 10 times (80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4*10=40. In the last 88 pages, 481-488, the tens digit is 8, but only 8 pages (481-488), so 8 times. So, 40 +8=48. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, 89 times.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding them up:\n4's: 48 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=187\n8's:49 (units)+48 (tens)+0=97\nDifference:187-97=90\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (once every 10 pages, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 times).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (10 in each of 4 blocks of 100, plus 10 in 441-450).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (pages 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (once every 10 pages, plus once at 488).\n- **Tens place:** 48 occurrences (10 in each of 4 blocks of 100, plus 8 in 481-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nDifference: 187 - 97 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me think about how 4's and 8's appear in each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every set of ten pages, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., each digit from 0-9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for 4's in the units place, each set of ten pages will have one 4. Similarly, each set of ten will have one 8 in the units place. But since the book has 488 pages, I need to check if 488 is a multiple of ten or not. It ends with an 8, so the last set is 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, how many complete sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten, and then an extra 8 pages. \n\nWait, no, actually, from page 1 to 480, that's 48 sets of ten, right? Because 480 divided by 10 is 48. Then from 481 to 488, that's 8 pages. So, for the units place, in each of the 48 complete sets, there's one 4 and one 8. So that's 48 4's and 48 8's. Now, in the last 8 pages, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, there's a 4 in 484, and an 8 in 488. So that's one more 4 and one more 8. So, in total, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 4's and 48 +1 = 49 8's. Wait, but 488 is included, so 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's correct. So, units place contributes 49 4's and 49 8's. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, in the tens place, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for each hundred, there are 10 4's in the tens place (like 40-49) and 10 8's (like 80-89). Now, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, there are 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10=40 4's and 4*10=40 8's. Now, in the last partial hundred, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, in the tens place, how many 4's and 8's are there? \n\nLooking at 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, ..., up to 8 for 480-488. So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 pages, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So, that's 10 4's in the tens place. Similarly, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 pages because 480 is included and 488 is the end. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages. So, in the tens place, from 401-488, we have 10 4's and 9 8's. \n\nTherefore, total in the tens place: 40 (from the first 400 pages) +10=50 4's, and 40 +9=49 8's. So, the tens place contributes 50 4's and 49 8's, making a difference of +1 for 4's.\n\nNow, onto the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, how many 4's are in the hundreds place? That's 89 times, right? Because each page from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. \n\nWhat about 8's in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. The hundreds digits go up to 4, so there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, the hundreds place contributes 89 4's and 0 8's, making a difference of +89 for 4's.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the contributions:\n\n- Units place: 49 4's, 49 8's\n- Tens place: 50 4's, 49 8's\n- Hundreds place: 89 4's, 0 8's\n\nAdding these up:\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, each digit 0-9 appears equally in the units place except possibly the last partial set. Each complete set of 10 pages has one 4 and one 8 in the units place. There are 48 complete sets (since 480 pages), each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 +1=49 4's, 48 +1=49 8's. That's correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach complete hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds contribute 40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (440-449) and 8 for 9 pages (480-488). So, 10 4's and 9 8's. So, total tens place: 40+10=50 4's, 40+9=49 8's. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 400-488, that's 89 pages, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's. No 8's in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 +50 +89 = 188\n8's: 49 +49 +0 = 98\nDifference: 188 -98 =90.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total complete sets of 10: 48 (up to page 480).\n   - Each set contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - Partial set (481-488): 4 and 8 each appear once.\n   - Total 4's: 48 +1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 48 +1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Complete hundreds: 4 (up to page 400).\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's.\n   - Partial hundred (401-488): 4 appears 10 times (440-449), 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 4\u00d710 +10 =50.\n   - Total 8's: 4\u00d710 +9 =49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - 4 appears 89 times (pages 400-488).\n   - 8 appears 0 times.\n   - Total 4's:89.\n   - Total 8's:0.\n\n**Total Counts**:\n- 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188.\n- 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98.\n\n**Difference**:188 -98 =90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, actually, since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488, so the highest is a three-digit number, 488. So, I guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers, and do the same for the digit 8, then subtract the two totals to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately. I'll handle the units place first, then the tens, and then the hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, there's one 4 and one 8. Now, since the book has 488 pages, let me see how many complete blocks of 10 there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and an extra 8 pages (since 48*10=480, and 488-480=8). \n\nIn each of these 48 complete blocks, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, that's 48 4's and 48 8's. Now, for the remaining 8 pages, which are 481 to 488, I need to check the units digits. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in this partial block, there's one 4 and one 8. Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's, which is also 49. So, in the units place, 4's and 8's are equal.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, in each block of 100, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. So, for the digit 4, it appears 10 times in the tens place in each 100-number block, same with 8. \n\nLet me figure out how many complete 100-number blocks there are in 488. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block from 401-488. \n\nIn each of the 4 complete blocks, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40 4's. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times in each block, so 4*10=40 8's. Now, for the partial block from 401-488, let's look at the tens digits. The numbers are 401-488, so the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 times, but wait, our partial block starts at 401, so 440-449 is within 401-488. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place here. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 times (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, but 480 is part of the partial block, so does 480 count? Let me check: 480 is within 401-488, yes. So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the partial block.\n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place: 40 (from complete blocks) + 10 (from partial) = 50. Total 8's in the tens place: 40 (from complete blocks) + 9 (from partial) = 49. So, in the tens place, there are 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit changes every 100 numbers. From 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0 (or not present). From 100-199, it's 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4. So, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488. \n\nHow many numbers are there from 400-488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's in the hundreds place: 89. Total 8's: 0.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts from each place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 48 complete blocks, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8, so 48 each. Then the last 8 pages (481-488) have one 4 and one 8, so total 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: 4 complete blocks, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's, so 40 each. Then the partial block from 401-488: 440-449 is 10 4's, and 480-488 is 9 8's. So, 40+10=50 for 4's, and 40+9=49 for 8's. That seems right.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. 8's: none, so 0. Correct.\n\nAdding up: 49+50+89=188 for 4's, and 49+49+0=98 for 8's. 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 pages contains one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks (480 pages) contributing 48 4's and 48 8's.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one 4 and one 8.\n   - Total: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 pages has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n   - 4 complete blocks (400 pages) contribute 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - The partial block (401-488) adds 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 4's.\n   - No page number has 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, actually, since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers can be 1-digit (1-9), 2-digit (10-99), or 3-digit (100-488). \n\nI think I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Maybe I can calculate how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and then do the same for 8. Then, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4. I'll consider each place one by one.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every group of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such groups are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10 and a partial group of 8. Since each full group contributes one 4 in the units place, that's 48 times. Then, in the partial group (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which is another 4. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check that. If I have 488 pages, then the number of times 4 appears in the units place is actually the number of times 4 is the last digit. So, from 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there here? Let's see, the first term is 4, and the last term is 484. The common difference is 10, so the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Yeah, that's correct. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. For the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers, 10 times in each block. For example, from 40-49, each number has a 4 in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block from 401-488. In each full block, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49). So, 4 blocks * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the partial block from 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-409, 1 for 410-419, etc., up to 8 for 480-488. But wait, the tens digit in 401-488 is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on. Wait, no, actually, 401-410 would have tens digit 0, 411-420 would have 1, etc., up to 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digits go up to 8 in 480-488. But in this case, the tens digit 4 would appear in 440-449. So, that's another 10 times. So, total tens place 4's are 4*10 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 1-400, there are 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. So, total 50. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but actually, page numbers go up to 488, so from 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, how many terms are there?\n\nThe first term is 8, the last term is 488. The common difference is 10. So, number of terms is ((488 -8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\nWait, but let me check. 8,18,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 8 more than 480, so yes, 488 is included. So, 49 times.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, each full block contributes 10 times, and the last block might be partial.\n\nSo, from 1-488, how many full blocks of 100 are there? 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). In each of these, the tens digit 8 appears in 80-89, which is 10 times. So, 4 blocks *10=40 times.\n\nNow, the partial block from 401-488. Here, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, 9 times.\n\nWait, but let me think again. 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the partial block. So, total tens place 8's are 4*10 +9=49.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. From 1-400, each 100 has 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, total 40+9=49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nTherefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds =49 +49 +0=98.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. Since the book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit can only be 1,2,3,4. So, no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0. So, total 8's are 49+49=98.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought the hundreds place for 4's was 89, which is correct because from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check the tens place for 4's. I thought it was 50, but let me recount.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4's, we have:\n\n- 1-100: 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n\n- 101-200: 140-149, another 10.\n\n- 201-300: 240-249, another 10.\n\n- 301-400: 340-349, another 10.\n\n- 401-488: 440-449, another 10.\n\nWait, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5*10=50. So, yes, 50.\n\nBut wait, 401-488 is only part of the 400-499 range, but since we're only going up to 488, 440-449 is fully included, so 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place. So, yes, 50 in total.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, we have:\n\n- 1-100: 80-89, 10 times.\n\n- 101-200:180-189,10.\n\n- 201-300:280-289,10.\n\n- 301-400:380-389,10.\n\n- 401-488:480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, total 4's:188, total 8's:98, difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for 4's was 89, but let me check that again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 4's. That's correct.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 4 to 484, there are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, giving 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with an additional 9 in 480-488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me think about how 4's and 8's appear in different places: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every 10 pages, the digits 0 through 9 each appear once in the units place. So, for 488 pages, how many times does each digit appear in the units place? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times in the units place, and then for the remaining 8 pages, digits 1 through 8 appear once each. So, for 4's in the units place, it's 48 times plus 1 more because 488 is the last page, which ends with an 8, so the 4 would have been in the 484th page. Wait, no, 488 is the last page, so the units digit goes up to 8, so the 4's in the units place would be 48 times because 488 doesn't add another 4. Wait, no, 488 is the 488th page, so the units digits go from 1 to 8 in the last partial set. So, the units digit 4 appears 48 times because each full set of 10 has one 4, and the last 8 pages don't include a 4. So, units place 4's: 48.\n\nNow, for the 8's in the units place, it's similar. Each full set of 10 has one 8, so 48 times, and in the last 8 pages, 8 appears once. So, 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place 8's: 49.\n\nWait, but wait, the last page is 488, so the units digit in 488 is 8, so in the last partial set, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once. So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, 8's in units place: 49, 4's in units place: 48. So, so far, 4's are less than 8's by 1 in the units place. But let me check that again.\n\nWait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets of 10 and a partial set of 8 pages. Each full set contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 times each. Then, in the partial set, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49, and units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, so that's equal. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, 488 pages, so the last page is 488. So, the units digits go from 1 to 8 in the last partial set. So, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, units place 4's: 48 (from full sets) + 1 = 49, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, equal in units place. So, 49 each. So, that's a tie in the units place.\n\nNow, let's move on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times every 100 pages. So, for 488 pages, how many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 pages in the 401-488 range.\n\nSo, in each full hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the digit 8 appears 10 times as well. So, for 4 full hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the 488th page). Let me see, from 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488, so the tens digit is 8 for pages 481-488, which is 8 pages.\n\nSo, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see, in the 401-410 range, the tens digit is 0, so no 4's. Wait, no, wait, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, so no 4's. Then 411-420: tens digit is 1, so no 4's. Similarly, 421-430: tens digit 2, 431-440: tens digit 3, 441-450: tens digit 4. So, from 441-450, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 pages, but since we're only going up to 488, 441-450 is fully included because 450 is less than 488. So, that's 10 times. Then, 451-460: tens digit 5, 461-470: tens digit 6, 471-480: tens digit 7, and 481-490: tens digit 8, but we only go up to 488, so that's 8 pages.\n\nWait, but wait, 401-488 is 88 pages, right? 488 - 400 = 88. So, in the 401-488 range, how many times does the tens digit equal 4? It's from 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. So, total 4's in the tens place from 401-488 is 10.\n\nSimilarly, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place in 401-488? It's from 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, 8 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place: 4 full hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 10 from the partial set, so 50.\n\nTotal 8's in the tens place: 4 full hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 8 from the partial set, so 48.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, 8's appear 48 times. So, 4's are ahead by 2 in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 for this book, since it's a 488-page book. So, the hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, and 4 for 300-399, 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times.\n\nHow many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would be where 8 appears in the hundreds place, but the book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, hundreds place: 4's appear 89 times, 8's appear 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, in the units place, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me recount.\n\nEach full set of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. There are 48 full sets of 10 in 488 pages (since 48*10=480), and then 8 remaining pages (481-488). So, units place:\n\n- 4's: 48 (from full sets) + 1 (from 484) = 49\n- 8's: 48 (from full sets) + 1 (from 488) = 49\n\nThat's correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each full hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so 4*10=40 each.\n\nIn the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (441-450) and 8 for 8 pages (481-488). So, 4's: 40 +10=50, 8's: 40 +8=48.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n- 8's: 0 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I missed something in the tens place. From 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. And 8 for 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times. So, yes, 10 and 8.\n\nWait, but 401-488 is 88 pages. Let me check if the count adds up. 401-410: 10 pages, 411-420:10, 421-430:10, 431-440:10, 441-450:10, 451-460:10, 461-470:10, 471-480:10, 481-488:8. That adds up to 10*8 +8= 88 pages. So, correct.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's:10, 8's:8.\n\nSo, 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50, 8's:40 +8=48.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49+50+89=188, 8's:49+48=97.\n\nDifference: 188-97=91.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Units Place Analysis:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total full sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 sets.\n   - Remaining pages: 8 (481-488).\n   - **4's in units place:** 48 (from full sets) + 1 (484) = 49.\n   - **8's in units place:** 48 (from full sets) + 1 (488) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place Analysis:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Full hundreds: 4 (1-400).\n   - Remaining pages: 88 (401-488).\n   - **4's in tens place:** 4*10=40 + 10 (441-450) = 50.\n   - **8's in tens place:** 4*10=40 + 8 (481-488) = 48.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place Analysis:**\n   - **4's in hundreds place:** 89 (400-488).\n   - **8's in hundreds place:** 0.\n\n4. **Total Count:**\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{91}$"
