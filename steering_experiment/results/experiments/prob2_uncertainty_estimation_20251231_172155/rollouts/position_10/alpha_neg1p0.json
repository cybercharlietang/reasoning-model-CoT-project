    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, there's one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, there are 480/10 = 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so no additional 4 in the units place here. So, total 4's in units place: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, in 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each of these blocks of 10 numbers contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Let me figure out how many such blocks there are up to 488. The first block is 40-49, that's 10 numbers. Then, 140-149, another 10. 240-249, another 10. 340-349, another 10. 440-449, another 10. Now, after 440-449, the next block would be 540-549, but since we're only going up to 488, we don't have that. So, how many complete blocks do we have? From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks. Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 x 10 = 50 4's. Now, let's check if there are any partial blocks. After 440-449, the next page is 450, which is beyond 449 but before 488. So, from 450 to 488, the tens digit doesn't have a 4 in the tens place because the tens digit cycles through 5,6,7,8,9,0, etc., but 488 is the last page. So, no additional 4's in the tens place beyond the 5 blocks. Therefore, total 4's in tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total number of 4's printed is 187. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, then every 10 after that. The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. To find the number of terms, we can think of it as (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place appears in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many complete blocks and any partial ones. Complete blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 x 10 = 40. Now, the partial block is 480-488. How many numbers here have 8 in the tens place? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, in the tens place, each of these has 8, so that's 9 more 8's. So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the Digit 4:**\n1. **Units Place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 480, there are 48 occurrences (480 / 10).\n2. **Tens Place:** 4 appears in blocks of 10 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149). There are 5 such blocks, contributing 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds Place:** 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**.\n\n**Counting the Digit 8:**\n1. **Units Place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 8 to 488, there are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens Place:** 8 appears in blocks of 10 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189) and in the partial block 480-488. This gives 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **89**.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " So, in 1-10, 4 appears once (at 4). Similarly, in 11-20, it appears once at 14, and so on. Since the book has 488 pages, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to how many complete groups of 10 there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, actually, each group of 10 contributes exactly one 4 in the units place, so from 1 to 480, there are 48 fours in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the units place cycles again, so 484 would be another 4. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 fours in the units place. Wait, but when I think about it, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 times completely (each cycle being 10 numbers) and then an extra 8 numbers (481-488). So, in each cycle, the units digit has one 4, so 48 cycles give 48 fours, and then in the last partial cycle, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, in 140-149, and so on. Let's calculate how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 0 to 488, the first range is 40-49, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Each complete group of 10 contributes one 8. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0 to 488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 eights in the tens place. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, in the tens place, each of the first four ranges gives 10 eights, and the last range gives 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 4 * 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, no eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me double-check the tens place for eights. Wait, 480-488 is the last range where the tens digit is 8. So, how many numbers are there from 480 to 488? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the tens place, that's 9 eights. So, the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights, so 4*10=40, plus the last 9, so total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, for fours, I had 188 fours, and for eights, 98 eights. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me recount the fours in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, that's correct.\n\nFor the eights, in the tens place, 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, that's correct.\n\nUnits place for fours: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds: 89. Total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nUnits place for eights: 49, tens place: 49. Total eights: 98.\n\nSo, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly? For the tens place in fours, I considered 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five ranges, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. That seems correct.\n\nFor eights, in the tens place, I have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's five ranges, but the last one only contributes 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place for eights, there are none because the book only goes up to 488, so hundreds digit can't be 8. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can write a small program or use another method to confirm, but since I'm doing this manually, let me see.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of each digit place separately and calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nFor units place:\n\n- Number of 4's: floor(488/10) + 1 if the last partial group includes 4. Wait, 488 /10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. Then, in the last group (481-488), the units digit is 4 at 484, so +1, so 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: floor(488/10)=48, and in the last group, units digit 8 is at 488, so +1, total 49.\n\nFor tens place:\n\n- Number of 4's: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 0-488, there are 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 400-488. Wait, no, actually, the tens digit being 4 occurs in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, that's 5 occurrences, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, 5 ranges, but the last one is only 9 numbers, so 4*10 + 9=49.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\n- 8's: 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are none.\n\nSo, total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because when I think about page numbers, sometimes the hundreds digit doesn't come into play for lower page counts, but I think I accounted for that correctly.\n\nAnother way to think about it: For each digit position, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits digit:\n\n- For 4: Number of complete cycles of 10 is 48 (since 488 /10 = 48.8), so 48 times, plus one more at 484, so 49.\n\n- For 8: Similarly, 48 complete cycles, plus one at 488, so 49.\n\nTens digit:\n\n- For 4: Each hundred has one cycle where the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers. From 0 to 488, how many hundreds are there? Well, the tens digit being 4 occurs in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, that's 5 times, each contributing 10, so 50.\n\n- For 8: Similarly, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, 5 times, but the last one is only 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds digit:\n\n- For 4: 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\n- For 8: 800-899, which is beyond 488, so 0.\n\nSo, adding up, fours: 49 +50 +89=188.\n\nEights: 49 +49=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, like 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such numbers are there? Let me calculate. The last number with 4 in the units place is 484, which is 484 = 4*100 + 84, but wait, 484 is 48*10 + 4, so the units digit is 4. To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full groups of 10, and then check the remainder. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, each group of 10 contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, the last group is 481-490, but since the book only goes up to 488, the units digit 4 appears in 481, 484, but wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit 4 appears in 484, which is the 48th occurrence. Wait, no, maybe I should think differently. From 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra in the incomplete group. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full decades, and the remainder is 8. So, in each full decade, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9, so 4 appears once per decade. So, 48 times. But wait, in the last partial decade, which is 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 4 appear in the units place here? Yes, at 484. So, that's one more. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, but wait, when I think about it, the first occurrence is at 4, then 14, 24,..., 484. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The nth term is 10n - 6, where n starts at 1. Wait, maybe it's better to calculate it as (488 + 1) / 10, taking the integer part. Wait, (488 + 1) is 489, divided by 10 is 48.9, so the integer part is 48. So, 48 times. But then, in the last partial decade, from 481 to 488, the units digits go up to 8, so 4 appears once more, making it 49. So, I think 49 is correct for units place 4's. Now, moving on to the tens place. 2. **Tens place (second digit from the right):** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449, and then maybe in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's calculate. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, right? So, from 1-99: 40-49, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. But wait, 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, but the tens digit is 8 there, so 4 doesn't appear in the tens place beyond 440-449. So, how many hundreds? From 1-400, there are four sets where the tens digit is 4: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349. Each contributes 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but let me check: 40-49: 10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. Now, moving on to the hundreds place. 3. **Hundreds place (third digit from the right):** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, each number has 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears in page numbers. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times? Similar to the 4's, let's calculate. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, each full decade contributes one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Now, in the last partial decade, 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place (second digit from the right):** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, each hundred contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last one, which might be incomplete. Let's calculate. From 1-99: 80-89, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, let me check: 480 is the first, then 481, 482, ..., 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 10 times in each of the first four hundreds (1-399), and 9 times in the last partial hundred (400-488). So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place (third digit from the right):** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check the tens place for 8. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. So, that's 9 numbers, as I thought. So, 4 times 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 (from 480-488) equals 49. So, 49 in tens place. Units place was 49, so total 98.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For units place, 8 appears once every 10 numbers, so 48 full decades give 48, and the last partial decade (481-488) includes 488, which adds one more, so 49 total. For tens place, as calculated, 49. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's was 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 4's. I had 5 sets of 10, so 50. Let me confirm:\n\nFrom 1-99: 40-49: 10\n100-199:140-149:10\n200-299:240-249:10\n300-399:340-349:10\n400-488:440-449:10\nThat's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nFor 8's in tens place:\n\nFrom 1-99:80-89:10\n100-199:180-189:10\n200-299:280-289:10\n300-399:380-389:10\n400-488:480-488:9\nTotal: 4*10 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 49, correct.\n\nUnits place for 8's: 49, correct.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: 89, correct.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about another way to calculate the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nAnother approach is to consider each digit position separately and calculate the number of times each digit appears.\n\nFor the units place:\n\n- For any digit d (other than 0), the number of times it appears in the units place from 1 to N is floor((N + 1)/10). So, for N=488, it's floor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10) = 48. But wait, that gives 48, but earlier I had 49. Hmm, maybe this formula is different.\n\nWait, let me check: from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? The first is 4, then 14, 24, ..., 484. So, the number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, the formula floor((N + 1)/10) would give 48.9, which is 48 when floored, but we need to add 1 because the first occurrence is at 4, which is the first term. So, perhaps the formula is floor((N + 1)/10) if the digit is not zero. But in this case, it's 48.9, so floor is 48, but actual count is 49. So, maybe the formula isn't directly applicable here because the last term is 484, which is less than 490. So, perhaps it's better to calculate as (N // 10) + 1 if the units digit is >= the target digit. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, the formula is a bit more involved. The number of times a digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to N is calculated by considering how many full hundreds there are and then the partial hundreds.\n\nBut perhaps my initial method was correct, and I just need to stick with it.\n\nSo, I think my counts are accurate: 188 4's and 98 8's, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me just recount the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nAnd for 8's, hundreds place: none, since the book ends at 488, which is less than 800. So, 0.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the number of 4's is 188 and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n### Counting the Digit 4:\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is calculated as follows:\n     - Each full group of 10 numbers contributes one 4.\n     - There are 48 full groups of 10, contributing 48 occurrences.\n     - In the partial group (481-488), 484 contributes one more occurrence.\n     - Total: \\(48 + 1 = 49\\).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Total: \\(4 \\times 10 + 10 = 50\\).\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488.\n   - This range includes 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1).\n   - Total: 89.\n\n- **Total occurrences of 4:** \\(49 + 50 + 89 = 188\\).\n\n### Counting the Digit 8:\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 488, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is calculated as follows:\n     - Each full group of 10 numbers contributes one 8.\n     - There are 48 full groups of 10, contributing 48 occurrences.\n     - In the partial group (481-488), 488 contributes one more occurrence.\n     - Total: \\(48 + 1 = 49\\).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences except the last partial range.\n   - The range 480-488 contributes 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: \\(4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49\\).\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n- **Total occurrences of 8:** \\(49 + 49 + 0 = 98\\).\n\n### Difference:\n- The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\(188 - 98 = 90\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{90}\n\\]"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers contributes one 4. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. To find the total, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full groups, each contributing one 4. That's 48 times. But wait, let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so that's 48 full groups, and then the last partial group is 480-488, which includes 484. So yes, that's 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where 4 is in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: one block (40-49). From 100-199: another block (140-149). Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, and 300-399: 340-349. Then, 400-488: 440-449. So that's a total of five blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times. Wait, but let me check the last block: 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's 10 numbers. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. That's 48 times. But wait, let me check: 488 includes 488, which ends with 8, so that's included in the 48th group. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count these blocks. From 0-99: 80-89 is one block. From 100-199: 180-189 is another. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. Then, 400-488: the next block would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488. So, 480-488 is a partial block. Each full block contributes 10 numbers, so let's count: 0-99: 1 block, 100-199: 1, 200-299: 1, 300-399: 1, and 400-488: the block starts at 480, but ends at 488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, the first four blocks are full, contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. The last block is partial, contributing 9 numbers. So total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, but let me check: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, yes, 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, 97 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract: 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 times (every 10 numbers).\n- **Tens place:** 50 times (five blocks of 10 numbers each).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 times (pages 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 times (every 10 numbers).\n- **Tens place:** 49 times (four full blocks and a partial block).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 times.\n\nTotal 8's = 48 + 49 + 0 = 97.\n\nDifference = 187 - 97 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, in every set of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. Now, how many such sets are there up to 488? Well, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers, so the number of sets of 10 is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a set, we'll take the integer part, which is 48 sets, and then check the remaining numbers. Each of these 48 sets contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, the remaining numbers after 48 sets (which is 480) are 481 to 488. In these, the units place goes from 1 to 8, so the digit 4 appears once more (at 484). So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. Specifically, in each block of 100, the 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Well, from 1 to 488, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. Each of the first four hundreds has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, ..., up to 8 for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 is present only up to 488. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only from 440-449. That's another 10 numbers, so adding 10 more. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 401-488 is actually 88 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 = 88. So, from 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 only once, from 440 to 449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, that's correct. So, total 4's in tens place: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400 up to 488. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, let's add them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears once every 10 numbers in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many such sets of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. That's 48. Then, the remaining numbers from 481 to 488: the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once at 488. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the 80-89 range, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since we're only going up to 488, the last block is 480-488. So, each of the first four hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) has one block of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 more. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check that again. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so 4 hundreds * 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the end). So, yes, 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of 10, contributing 48 fours. The remaining numbers (481-488) add one more 4, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers. From 1 to 400, there are 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 fours, totaling 40. From 401-488, 440-449 adds 10 more, making 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets, contributing 48 eights. The remaining numbers (481-488) add one more, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers. From 1 to 400, there are 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 eights, totaling 40. From 401-488, 480-488 adds 9 more, making 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, in each set of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once. How many such sets are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10, and then a partial set from 481 to 488. But wait, actually, since 488 is the last page, the units digit cycles every 10. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (sets of 10) plus any extra in the incomplete set. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48*1 = 48. Now, in the incomplete set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. Does 484 fall within this range? Yes, 484 is in 481-488, so that's one more 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block of 100 numbers has 10 instances where 4 is in the tens place. How many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial hundred from 401-488. Each complete hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10 = 40. Now, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The 4 in the tens place occurs in 440-449. So, from 401-488, how many numbers have 4 in the tens place? That's 10 numbers: 440-449. So, that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, in each set of 10, there's one 8. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place. That's 48. Then, in the incomplete set (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each such block has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there up to 488? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds. Each contributes one block of 10 with 8 in the tens place, so 4*10 = 40. Now, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes up to 8. So, 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but since the book ends at 488, that's 9 numbers: 480-488. Wait, no: 480-489 is 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers. Wait, but 488 is included, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would occur from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me verify each step again. For 4's: Units place: 48 complete sets (1-480) give 48, and 484 adds one more, total 49. Tens place: 4 complete hundreds (1-400) give 40, and 440-449 in the next partial hundred give 10, total 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89. Total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct. For 8's: Units place: 48 complete sets (1-480) give 48, and 488 adds one more, total 49. Tens place: 4 complete hundreds (1-400) give 40, and 480-488 gives 9, total 49. Hundreds place: 0. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers.

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks and then 8 numbers in the last partial block. But wait, in each full block, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9, so each block contributes one 4. So, 48 blocks give 48 fours in the units place. Now, in the last partial block, which is 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 484 fall into this? Yes, so that's another 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 fours in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 40-49: that's one block, 140-149: another, 240-249: another, 340-349: another, and 440-449: the fifth. So, 5 blocks each contributing 10 fours. So that's 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so does the 440-449 block go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, all five blocks are within 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400 up to 488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, let me add up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many 8's in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the last partial block is 481-488, which has 8 in the units place at 488. So, that's another 8. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's check each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: how many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, each of these blocks contributes 10 eights except the last one, which contributes 9 eights. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me think again. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 eights in the tens place, so that's 4*10 = 40. Then, the 480-488 block has 9 eights in the tens place because the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 more, making it 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, let's add up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of 4's = 48 (from 1-480) + 1 (484) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 fours.\n   - Number of blocks = 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total 4's = 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of 4's = 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of 8's = 48 (from 1-480) + 1 (488) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 eights, except the last block (480-488) which contributes 9.\n   - Number of blocks = 5 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488).\n   - Total 8's = 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of 8's = 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers contributes one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, there are 488 / 10 = 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so that means there are 48 full blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). In each full block, there's a 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial block, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484). So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the 40-49 range of each hundred. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see. The hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 (since 488 is the last page). For each hundred block (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens place 4 appears 10 times in each block (e.g., 40-49 in the first block, 140-149 in the second, etc.), except possibly the last block if it's incomplete. Wait, but the last block is 400-488, so the tens digit 4 would be in 440-449. So, in each of the first four hundred blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times each. That's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 times. Then, in the last block (400-488), the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So that's another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Wait, actually, from 0-99, the tens digit 4 is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, 100-199: 140-149, another 10. 200-299: 240-249, 10. 300-399: 340-349, 10. And 400-488: 440-449, 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5\u00d710=50. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me check: 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. Again, units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times? Similar to the 4's. 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, the last partial block, 481-488, has 8 in the units place once (488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 +1=49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, how many times? Each hundred block contributes 10 times in the tens place. Let's see: 0-99: 80-89, 10 times. 100-199: 180-189, 10 times. 200-299: 280-289, 10 times. 300-399: 380-389, 10 times. 400-488: 480-488. Wait, in the last block, 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so 9 times. So, total for tens place: 4 blocks \u00d710=40, plus the last block's 9, so 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the hundreds place contributes 0 times. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: (488 \u00f7 10) = 48 full cycles, plus 1 in the last partial cycle (484).\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block of 100 contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Total blocks: 5 (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n   - Total 4's: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total 4's: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: (488 \u00f7 10) = 48 full cycles, plus 1 in the last partial cycle (488).\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each block of 100 contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block which contributes 9 (480-488).\n   - Total blocks: 4 full blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and the last partial block.\n   - Total 8's: (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n- More 4's than 8's: 188 - 98 = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, from 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. How many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the 48th set would end at 480. Then, from 481 to 488, we have another 4 in 484. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, no, because 488 divided by 10 is 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the next partial cycle from 481-488, the 4 in the units place occurs once (at 484). So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, but wait, actually, 488 is the last page, so the units digit 4's would be every 10 pages, so from 4,14,...,484. Let me calculate how many terms are in this sequence. The first term is 4, the last term is 484. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are up to 488. The first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), the second is 140-149, third 240-249, fourth 340-349, and fifth 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. How many blocks are there? From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449: that's 5 blocks. So, 5 blocks \u00d710 =50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm. The first block is 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 4's. Then 140-149: another 10, so 20. 240-249: 30. 340-349:40. 440-449:50. So, yes, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. So, pages 400-488: how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 pages (since 488 -400 +1=89). But in the hundreds place, each of these pages has a 4. So, that's 89 times. So, total 4's in hundreds place:89. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds:49 +50 +89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so let's see how many terms are there. The first term is 8, the last term is 488, but wait, 488 is 488, which is in the hundreds place, but the units digit is 8. So, the sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1=(480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Each full block (like 80-89) contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's see how many full blocks there are and if there's a partial block. The blocks are: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place, each full block contributes 10 8's, and the last block contributes 9 8's. So, number of 8's in tens place:4 blocks \u00d710=40, plus 9 from the last partial block, so total 49. Wait, but let me check: from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4\u00d710 +9=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds:49 +49 +0=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 -98=90.

So, total 4's in units place would be 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, no, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete decades (sets of 10) times 1, plus any extra in the incomplete decade. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the incomplete decade from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (at 484). So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. Okay, that seems right. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: 40-49 (block 1), 140-149 (block 2), 240-249 (block 3), 340-349 (block 4), and 440-449 (block 5). Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, that's 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times. Wait, but does the last block go up to 449? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, let's add up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, I need to count the number of 8's in the same way. Let's go through each digit position again. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the incomplete decade from 481 to 488, the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once at 488. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let me count these blocks: 80-89 (block 1), 180-189 (block 2), 280-289 (block 3), 380-389 (block 4), and 480-488 (block 5). Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place, but the last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, in the tens place, each of the first four blocks has 10 8's, and the last block has 9 8's. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks \u00d710 + 1 block \u00d79 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check. From 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for all numbers from 480 to 489, but since we're only going up to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, yes, 9 times in the tens place for that block. So, total tens place 8's: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's: Units place: 48 complete decades (1-480) with 48 4's, plus 484, so 49. Tens place: 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, etc.), each contributing 10, so 5\u00d710=50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Total 4's: 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. Now, the 8's: Units place: 48 complete decades, 48 8's, plus 488, so 49. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4\u00d710=40 +9=49. Hundreds place: 0. Total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 480: 480 / 10 = 48 occurrences.\n   - From 481 to 488: 484 has a 4 in the units place, adding 1.\n   - Total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Total in tens place: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - This is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 480: 480 / 10 = 48 occurrences.\n   - From 481 to 488: 488 has an 8 in the units place, adding 1.\n   - Total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - There are 4 complete blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - The fifth block is 480-488, contributing 9 occurrences.\n   - Total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total in hundreds place: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every set of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, from 1 to 480, there are 480 numbers, which makes 48 groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digit cycles from 1 to 8, so the 48th group ends at 480, and the next group (481-490) would have a 4 in 484, but since we're only going up to 488, 484 is included. So, actually, we have 48 full groups plus one more 4 in the units place at 484. Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra in the incomplete decade. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and in the last partial decade (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 is included once. Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, so 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's look at the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, in 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, in 140-149, 240-249, etc. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, each subsequent block is 100 apart. So, the next block is 140-149, then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another block. So, how many blocks is that? Let's count: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 instances where 4 is in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is fully included in 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so the entire block is included. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 times. Therefore, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? It's the number of numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 times. Therefore, the total number of 4's is the sum of units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Wait, let me add that again: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Again, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and in the last partial decade (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 is included once. Therefore, total number of 8's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place. The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's count the blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 instances where 8 is in the tens place, except the last block, which is only 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, in the tens place, 8 appears in 480-488, but only in the tens digit for 480-488, which is 9 times, not 10. Wait, but actually, in the tens place, the digit is 8 for the entire block 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, each block contributes 10 times except the last one, which contributes 9 times. So, let's see: the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 times, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 times. So, total number of 8's in the tens place is 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check that again. From 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 times. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. And 480-488: 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 8 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, the number of times 8 appears in the hundreds place is 0. So, total number of 8's is the sum of units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Wait, let me add that again: 49 + 49 is 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For the 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400-488, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That seems right. And for the 8's in the hundreds place, since the book ends at 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, that's 0. Okay, so I think the calculations are correct. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades and one partial decade (481-488), totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks of 10 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), resulting in 5 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks of 10 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), with the last block (480-488) contributing 9 occurrences, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does this happen? Well, every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, I can divide 488 by 10 to find how many such blocks there are, but I need to be careful because 488 isn't a multiple of 10. Let me calculate: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a block, we take the integer part, which is 48. So, there are 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, does the 48th block end at 480, and then from 481 to 488, there's another 4 in the units place at 484? So, actually, I think I should add one more to account for that. So, units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, let me check that. The first block is 1-10, so 4 is at 4. The second block is 11-20, 4 at 14, and so on. Each block contributes one 4 in the units place, and since 488 is the last page, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is in the 48th block (since 48*10=480, so 480+4=484). So, actually, it's 48 times because from 1 to 480, there are 48 blocks, each contributing one 4. But wait, 488 is beyond 480, so from 481-488, the units place 4 is at 484, which is within this range. So, that's an additional 4, making it 49. Hmm, maybe I was right the first time. Alternatively, I can think of it as the number of 4's in the units place is the number of times 4 appears in 1-488, which is the integer division of 488 by 10, which is 48, plus 1 if the remainder is >=4. The remainder when 488 is divided by 10 is 8, which is >=4, so we add 1, making it 49. So, units place 4's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. In this case, the 4 is in the tens digit, so every block of 100 numbers will have 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. For example, from 40-49, each number has a 4 in the tens place. Similarly, from 140-149, and so on. So, let's see how many such blocks there are up to 488. The first block is 40-49, the second is 140-149, the third is 240-249, the fourth is 340-349, and the fifth would be 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 blocks * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check if the last block is complete. The last block is 440-449, which is entirely within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place 4's: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This happens when the page number is between 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? It's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. So, hundreds place 4's: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Using the same method as for 4's: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8. Now, the remainder is 8, which is >=8, so we add 1. So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, let me check: The last 8 in the units place before 488 is at 488 itself, which is 488. So, yes, that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place 8's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. So, how many complete blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five blocks. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 8's in the tens place. The last block, 480-488, contributes 9 8's (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, actually, in the tens place, it's the second digit. So, from 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for each, so that's 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks * 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, tens place 8's: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: Units place: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds:89. Total: 49+50=99; 99+89=188. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. From 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's. Similarly, 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: that's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so 9 8's. So, 4*10 +9=49. That's correct. For 4's in the tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 50. That's correct. For the hundreds place, 400-488: 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. That's correct. For 8's in the units place: same as 4's, 49. So, yes, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place (Ones Place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets of 10, plus an additional 4 at 484, totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, similar to 4, totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 8 appears in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and 480-488 contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place within 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, in the range 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, from 1 to 488, every set of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one number ending with 4. So, how many such sets are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets and then 8 more numbers (481-488). In each full set, there's one 4, so that's 48 times. Now, in the last partial set (481-488), does the units digit 4 appear? Yes, in 484. So that's one more. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each of these blocks contributes 10 times the digit 4 in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there in 1-488? Let's see: 40-49 (1 block), 140-149 (another), 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488? Yes, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, 400-488 is 89 numbers, but since we're only considering the hundreds digit, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. Wait, no, that's not correct. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book ends at 488, it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 4's. Wait, but actually, when counting digits, each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, let me add up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's printed: 188. Now, I need to do the same for 8's. Let's count the number of 8's in each digit position. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, and then 8 in the last partial set (481-488) as 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is the last block. So, how many such blocks? Let's see: 80-89 (1), 180-189 (2), 280-289 (3), 380-389 (4), and 480-488 (5). Each of these blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except the last one, which is only 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers, since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). Wait, no: 480 is the first, then 481, up to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 8's, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 8's. So, total 8's in the tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the 4's:**\n1. **Units Place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of 10 and one partial set (481-488). Thus, 48 + 1 = 49 4's.\n2. **Tens Place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are five such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 4's. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 4's.\n3. **Hundreds Place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 4's.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the 8's:**\n1. **Units Place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, 48 full sets and one partial set (481-488). Thus, 48 + 1 = 49 8's.\n2. **Tens Place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are four full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 10 each, and the partial block 480-488 contributing 9. So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49 8's.\n3. **Hundreds Place:** No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, in the range 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, there's one 4. So, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, I'll take the integer part, which is 48 times. Wait, but actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4, and then in the 489th group, which is just the number 488, the units digit is 8, so no extra 4 there. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. The tens place cycles every 100 numbers. In each hundred, the 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set in the hundreds would be 440-449, and then we have 450-488. So, how many full hundreds are there? From 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488. So, there are five sets where the tens digit is 4. Each set contributes 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50 times. Wait, but does 400-499 go beyond 488? Yes, because 488 is less than 499. So, the last set in the hundreds would be 440-449, which is within 488. So, from 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So that's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, that's 89 times. Now, adding up the number of 4's: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 fours in total. Now, I need to count the number of 8's in the same way. Let's go through units, tens, and hundreds place again. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 1-488, the number of 8's in the units place is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48 times. But wait, let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and then in the 489th group, which is 488, the units digit is 8, so that's an extra one. So, actually, it's 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but 488 is included, so when I divide 488 by 10, I get 48.8, meaning that the 48th group ends at 480, and then 481-488 is the 49th group. So, in the units place, 8 appears once every 10 numbers, so from 1-488, it's 48 full groups (1-480) giving 48 eights, and then in 481-488, the units digit 8 occurs once in 488. So, total 49 times. So, units place: 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 can appear in the tens place. Similar to 4's, in each hundred, the 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488, which is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, how many full sets? From 1-100: 80-89: 10 numbers. 101-200: 180-189:10. 201-300:280-289:10. 301-400:380-389:10. 401-488:480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 4 full sets with 10 each, and one set with 9. So, total in tens place: 4x10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4x10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that's 98. So, number of 4's is 187, number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units:48, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total:48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total:49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Yes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of 10, contributing 48 fours.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred (e.g., 40-49, 140-149). There are 5 such sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), contributing 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal number of 4's = 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of 10, plus one more in 488, totaling 49 eights.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred (e.g., 80-89, 180-189). There are 4 full sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights. Additionally, in the range 480-488, there are 9 numbers, contributing 9 eights. Total tens place eights = 40 + 9 = 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal number of 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " So, in each set of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. How many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, we'll take the whole number, which is 48. But wait, that might not account for the last partial set. Let me think. Each full set of 10 contributes one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, there are 48 sets, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this last partial set, does the units place have a 4? Yes, when the page is 484. So that's one more 4. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, no, that's not right. Because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets and then 8 extra numbers. So in each full set, 10 numbers, we have one 4 in the units place. So 48 sets give 48*1=48. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So that's 1 more. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. In this case, every block of 100 numbers has 10 instances where the tens digit is 4. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, etc. So, how many such blocks are there in 488? Let's see, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full blocks (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-499). Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last block (400-499) doesn't go all the way to 499, but only up to 488. So, in each full block, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 4 blocks give 4*10=40. Now, in the last partial block (400-488), the tens digit is 4 for numbers 440-449, right? Wait, no. Wait, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, etc. Wait, no, actually, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, 480-489. But our book only goes up to 488, so in the 400-488 range, how many times does the tens digit 4 occur? Let's think. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, in the partial block, we have 10 instances where the tens digit is 4. So total tens place 4's: 4 blocks *10=40, plus 10 in the partial block, so 40+10=50. Wait, no, that can't be right because 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but the tens digit cycles every 10. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10. So total tens place 4's: 4*10=40 (from 100-399) plus 10 (from 400-488) = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens in the numbers 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, 89 times. So total hundreds place 4's: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total number of 4's printed is 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. I need to count how many times 8 appears in the units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears once every 10 numbers in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full sets of 10 are there? 488/10=48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 488 is the only one with an 8 in the units place. So, that's 1 more. So total units place 8's: 48 +1=49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, in blocks of 10. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but our book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. So, how many full blocks are there? From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last). So, let's calculate: 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10, so 4*10=40. Then, the last partial block, 480-488, has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (480-488). So, 9. So total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total number of 8's printed is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract 98 from 188: 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 full sets of 10 in 480, contributing 48 instances. The last 8 numbers (481-488) include one more 4 (484). Total: 49.\n- **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each block of 100. There are 4 full blocks (100-399) contributing 40 instances. The last block (400-488) includes another 10 instances (440-449). Total: 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers 400-488, totaling 89 instances.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 full sets of 10 in 480, contributing 48 instances. The last 8 numbers (481-488) include one more 8 (488). Total: 49.\n- **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each block of 100. There are 4 full blocks (80-799) contributing 40 instances. The last partial block (480-488) includes 9 instances (480-488). Total: 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Since the book has 488 pages, the total number of times 4 appears in the units place is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we'll take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, actually, that's not quite right. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each complete group of 10, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so each digit, including 4, appears exactly once per group. So, 48 groups mean 48 times 4 appears in the units place. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. Therefore, total 4's in the units place are 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's look at the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, starting from 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where 4 is in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, from 1-100, 100-200, 200-300, 300-400, and 400-488. So, that's five blocks. Wait, no, from 1-100, 40-49 is one block. Then 140-149 is another, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's the fifth block. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where 4 is in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: from 1-100, 40-49: 10 numbers. 100-200, 140-149: 10. 200-300, 240-249: 10. 300-400, 340-349: 10. 400-488, 440-449: 10. So yes, that's 5\u00d710=50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Wait, but actually, in the hundreds place, each number from 400 to 488 has 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 numbers, but each contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, let me add up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's are 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers. So, from 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits from 1-8, so 8 appears once more at 488. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. This occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many full blocks there are. From 1-100: 80-89: 10 numbers. 100-200: 180-189: 10. 200-300: 280-289: 10. 300-400: 380-389: 10. 400-488: 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 4 blocks \u00d710 = 40, plus 9 in the last partial block. So, 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place, right? Because 480 has 8 in tens, 481, etc., up to 488. So yes, 9 times. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8 in the hundreds place. Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3, or 4. 8 would only appear in the hundreds place if the number is 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers where 8 is in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, let's add up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 complete groups of 10 in 488 pages, contributing 48 occurrences. The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) don't add any 4's in the units place. Total: 48.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks (1-100, 100-200, 200-300, 300-400, 400-488), each contributing 10 occurrences. Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. Total: 89.\n\nTotal number of 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 complete groups, contributing 48 occurrences. The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include one more 8 at 488. Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 complete blocks contributing 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 occurrences. Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488. Total: 0.\n\nTotal number of 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, like 4,14,24,...,484. To find how many such numbers there are, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full groups of 10, and then the remainder is 8. So, 48 full groups would give 48 times 4 in the units place, and then in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (484). So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, and the 49th group starts at 481 and ends at 490, but since we only go up to 488, the units digit 4 appears at 484, which is within this group. So yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, in 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each of these blocks contributes 10 times the digit 4 in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: from 0-99: 40-49 is one block. 100-199: 140-149. 200-299: 240-249. 300-399: 340-349. 400-488: 440-449. So, that's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, the last block is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4, so every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and the last partial group (481-488) includes 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count how many such blocks are there up to 488. 0-99: 80-89 (1 block). 100-199: 180-189 (1 block). 200-299: 280-289 (1 block). 300-399: 380-389 (1 block). 400-488: 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488. So, that's the fifth block, but does it count as a full block? Each block contributes 10 8's in the tens place. So, 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers, but wait, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the number of 8's in the tens place here is 9, not 10. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks with 10 each (from 0-399) and 1 block with 9. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189: 10. 200-299: 280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488:9 numbers. So, 4x10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, zero 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484), totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488), totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in 1-488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, in each set of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. How many such sets are there up to 488? Well, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48 full sets (which is 480 numbers) and 8 remaining numbers (481-488). Each full set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so the 4 appears once more in 484. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks exist up to 488. The first block is 40-49, the second is 140-149, the third is 240-249, the fourth is 340-349, and the fifth would be 440-449. Each contributes 10 4's, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, let's check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, it is. So that's 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages. How many pages are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, the number of 8's in the units place is 48 full sets (480 numbers) contributing 48 times, and the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 488, so that's one more 8. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block contributes 10 8's. Let's count how many such blocks are there up to 488. The blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. That's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 8's, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. However, the last block is only up to 488, so the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 for all these, so actually, it's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 8's in the tens place for the last block. Wait, no, because 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but we only have up to 488, so 9 numbers. But the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers, so that's 9 8's in the tens place for the last block. So, adjusting that, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. The last block (480-488) contributes 9 8's. So total 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 5 blocks, but now I'm getting 49. Let me double-check. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in the following ranges: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 4 full blocks and one partial block. So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of 10 (480 numbers), each contributing one 4, totaling 48.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 484, adding one more.\n   - **Total in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 4's.\n   - **Total in tens place:** 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets, contributing 48, plus one more in 488.\n   - **Total in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - There are 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), contributing 40, plus 9 more in 480-488.\n   - **Total in tens place:** 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, in each set of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once. How many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets and then an extra 8 pages. But since we're only looking at the units place, each set contributes one 4. So, 48 times 1 is 48. But wait, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit 4 appears in 484. So, that's one more 4. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where 4 is in the tens place. How many such blocks are there in 488? Well, the first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, in 488 pages, there are 48 full sets of 10, contributing 48 8's. Plus, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit 8 appears in 488. So, that's one more 8. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers. So, from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Each full block (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 8's in the tens place. So, let's see how many full blocks there are. The first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 8's, so that's 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, the last partial block is 480-488, which has 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can only appear in the hundreds place if the number is 800 or above, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

    "text": " So, from 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Let me calculate how many such numbers there are. The sequence starts at 4 and ends at 484, with each step being 10. The formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. Wait, but does 484 count? Yes, because 484 is within 488. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, starting at 40-49, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then each subsequent hundred adds another 10. So, 40-49 (1st hundred), 140-149 (2nd), 240-249 (3rd), 340-349 (4th), and 440-449 (5th). But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 only from 400-488. So, in the hundreds place, every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, let me confirm: 400 is the first, 401, 402, ..., up to 488. So, yes, that's 89 numbers. So, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me calculate how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. The common difference is 10. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let me check each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, total in the tens place: 4 ranges with 10 numbers each and one range with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, in 1-10, 4 appears once. Then in 11-20, again once, and so on. Since the book has 488 pages, let's see how many complete groups of 10 there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups and then a partial group of 8 numbers (481-488). So, in each complete group, 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once here as well. So total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, in 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, in 140-149, and so on. Let's see how many such blocks there are up to 488. The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10, then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. Now, how many such blocks are there? Let me count: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 488 is less than 490, so in the hundreds place, 440-449 is okay, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 blocks, each with 10 4's, so 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But 488 is the last page, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4. Now, when does 4 appear in the hundreds place? That's from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400-488? Let's see, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, wait, but 488 is included, so 488 is the 89th number. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 4's. Now, let me add up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers in the units place. So, from 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups and a partial group of 8 numbers. Each complete group has one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. In the partial group, 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once here as well. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that block. So, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers where 8 is in the tens place. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers, since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, for the first four blocks, 4 blocks * 10 = 40. The last block contributes 9 8's in the tens place. So total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8 in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 when the number is from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, and hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - There are 48 complete groups of 10 (1-480) and a partial group (481-488).\n   - Each group contributes 1 occurrence, totaling 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers every 100 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n   - There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488.\n   - There are 89 numbers (400-488), each contributing 1 occurrence, totaling 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - There are 48 complete groups and a partial group (481-488), contributing 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers every 100 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n   - There are 5 blocks, but the last block (480-488) has only 9 numbers.\n   - Total occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, in each set of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once. Let me calculate how many such sets there are up to 488. The total number of units places is 488, so the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a count, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but let me check that. For example, from 1 to 480, there are exactly 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the units place goes from 1 to 8, so there's one more 4 in 484. So, actually, it's 48 (from 1-480) plus 1 (from 484), making it 49. Hmm, so maybe my initial thought was wrong. Let me think again. The number of 4's in the units place is the number of times 4 appears in the units digit from 1 to 488. That would be every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, but since we're counting whole numbers, it's actually 48 full sets (each contributing one 4) plus an extra 4 in 484, so total 49. Okay, so 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where 4 is in the tens place. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the ranges would be 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Since 449 is less than 488, yes, it is. So 5 ranges, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's see. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, and then in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so that's one more 8 in 488. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488). Let me count each range: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me think again. When counting the tens place for 4's, I had 5 ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's, so 50. That's correct. For 8's in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. That's 5 ranges, but the last one is only 9 numbers, so 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems right. Units place for both digits: 4's had 49, 8's had 49 as well. So, yes, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers.

Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets and then a partial set from 481 to 488. So, in each full set, there's one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the partial set from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which adds one more 4. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Let's see: 40-49 is the first block, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50. So, tens place 4's: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 4's: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188.

So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is included, but since the book only goes up to 488, the tens place 8's in 480-488 would be from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 9 times. So, how many blocks are there? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 full blocks and one partial block. Each full block contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40, plus 9 from the partial block, so total tens place 8's: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can only appear in the hundreds place if the number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Total occurrences: 48 full sets of 10 (480 numbers) + 1 in the partial set (484), totaling 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, so 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89 (from 400 to 488 inclusive).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Total occurrences: 48 full sets of 10 (480 numbers) + 1 in the partial set (488), totaling 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges contribute 10 each (4 \u00d7 10 = 40), and the last range contributes 9 (480-488).\n   - Total occurrences: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, in each set of 10 numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., there's exactly one 4 in the units place. Now, how many such sets are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10 and then a partial set from 481 to 488. In each full set, there's one 4, so that's 48 fours. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is the only number with a 4 in the units place. So that's 1 more. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, in 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all ten numbers. Similarly, in 140-149, 240-249, etc. How many such sets are there? Well, up to 488, the hundreds digits go up to 4. So, for each hundred, there's a set where the tens digit is 4. Let's see: 40-49: that's one set. Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? So that's five sets in total. Each set contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 fours. Wait, but wait: 440-449 is the last set, and 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, 50 fours from the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, let me add up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers in the units place. So, up to 488, how many such sets are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets and a partial set. Each full set contributes one 8, so 48 eights. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is the only number with an 8 in the units place. So, that's 1 more. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9, so 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers each time. Let me check how many such sets there are up to 488. The hundreds digits go up to 4, so we have 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. In each of the first four hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit cycles through 0-9, so each has exactly 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. That's 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40 eights. Now, in the last set, 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for numbers 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but wait: 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 eights. So, total in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can only appear in the hundreds place if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that seems a bit low. Let me double-check the tens place for 400-488. So, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? Because 480 is the first number with 8 in the tens place, and 488 is the last. So, that's 9 eights. So, 40 from the first four hundreds and 9 from the last partial hundred, total 49. So, 49 in tens place. Units place is 49, so total 98 eights. Now, let's compare the number of 4's and 8's. Number of 4's: 188. Number of 8's: 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with the 4's: Units place: 48 full sets (1-480) contributing 48 fours, and then 484, so 49. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449: that's 5 sets, each with 10 fours, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct. Now for 8's: Units place: 48 full sets, each contributing 1 eight, so 48, plus 488, so 49. Tens place: in each full hundred (0-99, 100-199, etc.), 10 eights each, so 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 40 + 9 = 49. Hundreds place: none, so 0. Total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - There are 48 full sets of 10 in 480, contributing 48 fours.\n   - The last partial set (481-488) includes 484, adding 1 more.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in sequences like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - There are 5 such sequences up to 488 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Each sequence contributes 10 fours.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - This is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1).\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - There are 48 full sets of 10 in 480, contributing 48 eights.\n   - The last partial set (481-488) includes 488, adding 1 more.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in sequences like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - There are 4 full sequences up to 400 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights.\n   - In the last partial hundred (400-488), 480-488 contributes 9 eights.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n- More 4's than 8's: 188 - 98 = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, in each set of 10 numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the digit 4 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many such sets are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, I'll take the integer part, which is 48 complete sets. Each set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, the last set is 481-490, but our book stops at 488. So, the units place in 481, 482, ..., 488 will still have a 4 in the units place for 484. So, actually, the count remains 48 because even though we don't go all the way to 490, the 48th set ends at 480, and then the next 4 in the units place is at 484, which is within 488. So, 48 times. Wait, no, actually, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so the number of times 4 appears in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48 times. So, 48 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where 4 is in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, all 5 blocks are within the range. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, 400-488 is indeed 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, let me add up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's floor(488/10) = 48 times. Wait, but let me check: 10 numbers per set, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, in the last set, which is 481-490, the units digit 8 would be at 488, which is within the book. So, yes, 48 times. So, 48 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's see how many full blocks there are. Each block is 10 numbers where 8 is in the tens place. So, 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-489: but our book stops at 488, so only 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many full blocks? The first four blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's four blocks, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. Wait, but let me double-check: from 80-89: 10 8's. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, let me add up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, 97 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets of 10, resulting in 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each block of 100 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, like 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. To find the total number, I can calculate how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets, and then a partial set from 481 to 488. Each complete set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the partial set, the units digit is 4 in 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, total 4's in the units place: 49. Wait, let me check that again. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, the number of 4's in the units place is the number of times 4 appears in 1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490. But since 488 is the last page, the last set is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in each set of 10, there's one 4 in the units place, so 48 full sets (from 1-10 to 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the last set is incomplete). So, 48 sets \u00d7 1 = 48, plus the 484 which is the 49th occurrence. So yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place (second digit):** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which is the second digit from the right. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in each hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. Let me see how many hundreds we have. 488 is less than 500, so we have 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), there's a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. That's 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, in the last set, 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, total in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place (third digit):** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place, which is the third digit from the right. This happens in the range 400-488. In this range, every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, let me add up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times? From 1 to 488, each 10 numbers contribute one 8. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, and then in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit is 8 in 488. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place (second digit):** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count: From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Each hundred has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, in 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers). 101-200: 180-189 (10). 201-300: 280-289 (10). 301-400: 380-389 (10). And 401-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 is the last page, so from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, each of the first four hundreds contributes 10, and the last contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place (third digit):** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units Place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens Place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, contributing 50 occurrences (4 sets of 10 in each hundred and one more in the last partial hundred).\n3. **Hundreds Place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n1. **Units Place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens Place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, contributing 49 occurrences (four full sets of 10 and a partial set of 9 in the last hundred).\n3. **Hundreds Place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, there's one 4. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, let me check: the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, there are 48 full cycles of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, that's 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page. The last units digit is 8, so 488 doesn't add an extra 4 in the units place beyond the 48 cycles. So, 48 times is correct. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. Similarly, every block of 100 numbers, the 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: The first block is 0-99, then 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, in each hundred block, the tens place cycles every 100 numbers. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Each hundred block contributes 10 instances where the tens digit is 4. So, from 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers), 100-199: 140-149 (10), 200-299: 240-249 (10), 300-399: 340-349 (10), and 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, 400-488 is only up to 488, so 440-449 is within that, so yes, 10 numbers. So, total 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place when the number is between 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 ends with 8, so the last number is 488, which is the 48th cycle plus one more. Wait, no, 488 is the 48th cycle plus 8 more numbers beyond 480. So, the units digit 8 appears once in each cycle, so 48 times, plus one more in 488, making it 49 times. Wait, let me check: From 1 to 480, that's 480 numbers, which is 48 cycles of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digit cycles 8 again at 488, so that's one more, making it 49. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 in the tens place. Similar to 4, every block of 100 numbers, the 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers. So, from 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers), 100-199: 180-189 (10), 200-299: 280-289 (10), 300-399: 380-389 (10), and 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, because 488 is the end). Wait, so in the 400-488 block, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, how many blocks have 10 numbers? The first four blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each contribute 10, so 4*10=40. The last block (400-488) contributes 9. So, total in the tens place: 40+9=49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place. From 1-488, when does the hundreds digit become 8? That would be from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's: units place: 48, tens place: 50, hundreds place:89. 48+50=98, +89=187. That seems correct. Now, 8's: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place (1s place):** Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full cycles of 10, so 48 times.\n   - **Tens place (10s place):** Every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. There are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), each contributing 10 times, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place (100s place):** From 400 to 488, 4 appears in the hundreds place for 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1).\n   - **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place (1s place):** Every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full cycles, plus one more at 488, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens place (10s place):** Every 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times. The first four blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) contribute 40, and the last block (400-488) contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place (100s place):** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place up to 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** Subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many such sets are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That's 48 times. But wait, in the last partial set from 481 to 488, the units place 4 appears once (484). So that's 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each of these sets has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such sets are there up to 488? Well, the first set is 40-49, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's five sets. Each set contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400 to 488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears once every 10 numbers in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. Plus, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be another set, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488. Let me count how many sets. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10, and 480-488: which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's five sets, but the last one only has 9 numbers. Each of the first four sets contributes 10 8's, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. The last set (480-488) contributes 9 8's in the tens place. So total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book is only 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the hundreds place contributes 0 8's. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets of 10, contributing 48 times. Additionally, in the last partial set (481-488), 484 contributes one more. Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers. There are five sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 occurrences. Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400 to 488, 4 appears in the hundreds place for 89 numbers. Total: 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets, contributing 48 times. Additionally, 488 contributes one more. Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers. There are four complete sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 occurrences, and the last partial set (480-488) contributes 9. Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No page number reaches 800, so 8 doesn't appear here. Total: 0.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers contributes one 4. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Let's see, the last number with 4 in the units place before 488 is 484. To find how many such numbers there are, I can calculate how many full groups of 10 are there in 488 and then see if there's a partial group. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, and then the 49th group starts at 480 and ends at 488. So, from 480 to 488, the units digit 4 occurs at 484. So, total 4's in units place are 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 488 is the last number, so from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48 times, because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4. Wait, but 488 is the 489th number, but the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. Wait, but when I think about 1 to 488, the number 484 is the last one with 4 in the units place. So, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? It's 48 times because 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4. So, 48 times. So, 48 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. So, every block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Let's see how many such blocks there are in 488. The first block is 40-49, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. That happens from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 187 4's. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll go through each digit position as well. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. So, 48 times. Wait, but let me check the last group: 480-488. The units digit 8 occurs at 488. So, that's included in the 48 groups, so 48 times. So, 48 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place every block of 100. So, from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's see how many full blocks there are. The blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except the last block, which only goes up to 488, so it's 9 numbers (480-488) where the tens digit is 8. Wait, no: 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them except 488, which is 488, so the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but wait, 480 is 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Wait, no, from 480 to 489, the tens digit is 8, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, in each block, except the last one, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. The last block has 9 numbers. So, the number of 8's in the tens place is 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 from the last block, totaling 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, total 97 8's. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups).\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks of 10 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149), totaling 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, totaling 89 times (488 - 400 + 1).\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks of 10 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189), with the last block (480-488) contributing 9 times, totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** No 8's appear since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 48 + 49 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers contributes one 4. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, the last page is 488, which is a units digit of 8, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484. So, actually, it's exactly 48 times. Wait, no, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full blocks, each contributing a 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the blocks 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 4's in the tens place. But wait, does the 440-449 block go beyond 488? Let's see. 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers), 100-199: 140-149 (10), 200-299: 240-249 (10), 300-399: 340-349 (10), 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's. So, 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place only in the numbers 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Similar to the 4's, it's 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full blocks. But wait, the last page is 488, which is an 8 in the units place. So, actually, it's 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, let me think again. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is the number of complete decades (blocks of 10) plus any extra in the last partial block. The total number is floor(488 / 10) = 48, but since 488 ends with 8, we add 1 more, making it 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the blocks 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last block. Each full block (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's count how many full blocks there are. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers), 100-199: 180-189 (10), 200-299: 280-289 (10), 300-399: 380-389 (10), 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last page). So, for the first four blocks, each contributes 10 8's, so 4 * 10 = 40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is in the 800-899 range. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units: 48, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. For 8's: units: 49, tens: 49, hundreds: 0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, but wait, let me check the units place for 8's again. From 1 to 488, how many 8's in units place? The last number is 488, which is 8 in units. So, 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing an 8, plus the last 8 in 488, so 49. Correct. For tens place: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Correct. So, 98 8's. So, 187-98=89. So, the answer should be 89. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because I thought maybe the hundreds place for 8's would have some, but no, since the book only goes up to 488, which is less than 800, so no 8's in hundreds place. So, yes, 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets of 10, so 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (including 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No numbers have 8 in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " So, in 1-10, 4 appears once (at 4). In 11-20, it's at 14, and so on. To find how many times 4 appears in the units place up to 488, I can calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are and then check the remaining numbers. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place, which is 48 times. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit cycles from 1 to 8, so 484 is the only number with a 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Similarly, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, in 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see: from 1-99, 40-49 gives 10 times. Then from 100-199, 140-149 is another 10 times. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10 times. Let me count how many hundreds: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, for each hundred, except the last one, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, 100-199: 10, 200-299: 10, 300-399:10, and 400-488: the tens digit 4 would be in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 10 (from 40-49) + 10 (140-149) + 10 (240-249) + 10 (340-349) + 10 (440-449) = 50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So, total 4's in hundreds place: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, I need to count the number of 8's. Let's do the same approach, checking each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, starting at 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. From 1-99: 80-89, which is 10 times. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10 times. From 200-299: 280-289, 10 times. From 300-399: 380-389, 10 times. From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 10 (from 80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can only appear in the hundreds place if the number is 800 or above, but since the book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of 4's: (488 \u00f7 10) = 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, plus one more in the partial group (484).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 occurrences, and all are within 488 except possibly the last.\n   - Total: 10 (40-49) + 10 (140-149) + 10 (240-249) + 10 (340-349) + 10 (440-449) = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of 8's: (488 - 8) \u00f7 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each set contributes 10 occurrences except the last, which contributes 9.\n   - Total: 10 (80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book only has 488 pages.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers has one 4 in the units place. So, for example, 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. Let me calculate how many such numbers there are. The last number with 4 in the units place is 484, which is 484 = 480 + 4, so that's the 48th set of 10 numbers. So, that would be 48 times. Wait, but wait, 488 is the last page. So, 484 is within 488, so yes, 48 times. Wait, but let me check: from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? It's 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 complete groups. Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, 488 is the 489th number, but the last group is 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the last group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, does that affect the count? Hmm, no, because in each group of 10, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9, so the 4 in the units place occurs once per group. So, even if the last group isn't complete, the 4 would still occur once in each group. So, 48 times for the units place. 2. **Tens place (second digit):** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks exist up to 488. The first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), the next is 140-149, then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (1 block). From 100-199: 140-149 (1 block). From 200-299: 240-249 (1 block). From 300-399: 340-349 (1 block). From 400-488: 440-449 (1 block). So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, does the last block (440-449) fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times for the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place (third digit):** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's see, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit 8 occurs in 488. So, how many such numbers? Let's calculate. The first occurrence is 8, then every 10 numbers after that. The last occurrence is 488, which is 488 = 480 + 8, so that's the 48th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is the 489th number, but the units digit 8 occurs once every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many times? It's the same as the number of complete groups of 10, which is 48, plus one more if the last number is 488, which has an 8 in the units place. Wait, no, because 488 is included in the 48th group (480-489), but since we only go up to 488, it's still included. So, 48 times. Wait, but let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks exist up to 488. From 0-99: 80-89 (1 block). From 100-199: 180-189 (1 block). From 200-299: 280-289 (1 block). From 300-399: 380-389 (1 block). From 400-488: Does 480-489 fall within 488? Yes, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 block, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481,...,488). Wait, but in the tens place, it's the second digit. So, 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but each block of 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 8, contributing 10 8's. But in the last block (400-488), the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-489, but we only go up to 488, so it's 9 numbers instead of 10. So, for the tens place, how many times does 8 appear? Let's see: From 0-99: 10 times (80-89). From 100-199: 10 times (180-189). From 200-299: 10 times (280-289). From 300-399: 10 times (380-389). From 400-488: 9 times (480-488). So total is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, so that's 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 49 + 0 = 97. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times (from 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times (from 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488, totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n- **Total 8's:** 48 + 49 + 0 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every set of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of 4's in the units place would be the total number of such sets. Let me calculate that. The total number of units places from 1 to 488 is 488. Since every 10 numbers contribute one 4, the number of 4's in the units place is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but actually, 488 is a multiple of 10? No, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. So, in the 49th set (which would be 481-490), but since the book only goes up to 488, the units digit 4 appears once more at 484. So, actually, it's 48 full sets plus one more, making it 49 times. Wait, maybe I should think of it as (488 // 10) + 1 if the last number is beyond the next multiple. Hmm, maybe a better approach is to calculate how many complete decades there are and then check the remainder. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48*1=48. Then, in the incomplete decade (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once at 484. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, so 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. Each time, it's a block of 100 numbers where the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. For example, in 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149, 240-249, etc. So, how many such blocks are there in 1-488? Let's see. The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10, and so on. Each block contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Well, let's see. The blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks in total. Each block gives 10 4's in the tens place, so 5*10=50. But wait, let me check. From 40-49: yes, that's 10. 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 blocks, 5*10=50. Now, is there any more? After 440-449, the next would be 540-549, but since the book ends at 488, that's beyond, so no. So, total 4's in the tens place are 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This would be from 400-488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, let me add up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, just like 4. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Using the same method as before: 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48*1=48. Then, in the incomplete decade (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once at 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of that block. Let me count how many such blocks. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place, and the last block contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page numbers are from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, checking the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49. Correct, since 488//10=48 with remainder 8, so 48 +1=49.\n- Tens place: 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89. Correct.\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89=188. That seems right.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49. Correct, same as 4's.\n- Tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one block of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 0. Correct.\nTotal 8's: 49 +49=98. Correct.\n\nSo, difference: 188 -98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I just thought, when counting the hundreds place for 4's, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 -400 +1=89. So, that's correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place of 8's, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place there. That's correct.\n\nHmm, seems like I didn't make a mistake. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place (Ones Place):** The digit '4' appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades (480 numbers) contributing 48 occurrences, plus one more at 484, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** '4' appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** '4' appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to '4', '8' appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** '8' appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full blocks contributing 40, plus 9 more in 480-488, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** '8' does not appear in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the number of '8's from '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, it appears once. So, how many sets of 10 are there in 488? Let me calculate 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. Since we can't have a fraction of a set, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, each set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, let me check: from 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. In the tens place, 4 appears in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where 4 is in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, the last block is 400-488, which is only 89 numbers, but the 4 in the tens place would be from 400-409, 410-419, etc., but actually, the 4 in the tens place in 400-488 would be from 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, and 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, 480-489. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the last block in the 400s would be 480-488, which is 9 numbers. But actually, the tens digit is 4 in the block 400-409, which is 10 numbers, but wait, no: the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, but 400-409 is 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, in each hundred block, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many hundred blocks do we have? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So that's 5 blocks. But wait, in the 400-488 block, does the tens digit 4 go up to 480-489? But since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 4 in the 400s would be from 400-409, 410-419, ..., up to 480-488. Wait, but in the 400s, the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409, 410-419, etc., but actually, the tens digit being 4 in the 400s would be when the tens place is 4, regardless of the hundreds place. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, and 480-488. Wait, but that's 9 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers except the last one, which is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, no: the tens digit is 4 in the tens place, so in each block of 100, the tens digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each 100 numbers, the tens digit is 4 exactly 10 times. So, from 0-488, how many hundreds? 5 hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. But the last one is only 89 numbers (from 400-488). However, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, and 480-488. Wait, that's 9 blocks, but each of these blocks has 10 numbers except the last one, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but the tens digit is 4 in the tens place, so in 400-409, the tens digit is 0, right? Wait, no: 400-409, the tens digit is 0, and the units digit cycles from 0-9. So, actually, the tens digit being 4 occurs when the tens place is 4, which would be in 400-409? No, wait, that's not correct. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The tens digit is 4 when the number is in the form x4y, where x is the hundreds digit and y is the units digit. So, for example, 400-409: tens digit is 0, so that's not 4. Wait, no, 400-409: the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit is 0, and the units digit cycles from 0-9. So, the tens digit is 4 when the number is like x4y, where x is the hundreds digit, and y is the units digit. So, in each hundred block, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: e.g., 040-049, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but in the 0-99 block, the hundreds digit is 0, so the numbers are 040-049, which is 40-49. Similarly, in 100-199, it's 140-149, and so on. So, in each hundred block, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times. So, from 0-488, how many hundred blocks? 5: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Now, in each of the first four hundred blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit 4 occurs exactly 10 times each. So that's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, in the 400-488 block, how many times does the tens digit 4 occur? The numbers where tens digit is 4 are 440-449. Wait, because in 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, and the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. So that's 10 numbers: 440,441,...,449. But wait, does 449 exist? Since the book goes up to 488, yes, 449 is within 400-488. So, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times. So total tens digit 4's: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 4 blocks \u00d710 is 40, plus 10 is 50. So, total 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, let me check: the last 8 in the units place is at 488, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Each block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last one, which is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many blocks? From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers). So, total in tens place: 4 blocks \u00d710 + 1\u00d79 = 40 +9=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times. Therefore, total number of 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 +49=97. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, for the 4's: units place 48, tens place 50, hundreds place 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. For the 8's: units place 48, tens place 49, hundreds 0. 48+49=97. So, 187-97=90. Hmm, but let me think again about the tens place for 4's. I had 50 occurrences. Let me verify that. From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so 4\u00d710=40. In the 400-488 block, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 40+10=50. That seems correct. For the 8's in the tens place, I had 4 blocks contributing 10 each (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399) and the last block 400-488 contributing 9 (480-488). So, 4\u00d710=40 +9=49. That seems correct. Units place: both 4 and 8 have 48 occurrences each. So, the difference is 187-97=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers.

    "text": " So, in each set of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. To find how many times this happens, I can calculate how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488. That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a set, we take the integer part, which is 48. So, 48 times 4 appears in the units place. But wait, I think I should check if the last set is complete. The last set would be 481-490, but since the book only goes up to 488, the units place 4 in 484 is still counted. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, in 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. So, how many such sets are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete sets. Each set contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, 4 x 10 = 40. But wait, let me check the last set. The last set would be 400-499, but our book ends at 488. So, in the 400-488 range, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? From 400 to 488, the tens digit is 0-8. So, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449. That's 10 numbers. So, yes, 40 times in total. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. Wait, but actually, each of these numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, let me sum up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 40 = 88, 88 + 89 = 177. So, 177 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets. Each set contributes one 8 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, let me check the last set. The last number is 488, so the units digit is 8, which is included in the 48th set (480-488). So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, in 80-89, the tens digit is 8 for all 10 numbers. So, how many such sets are there in 488? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete sets. Each set contributes 10 occurrences. So, 4 x 10 = 40. But wait, let's check the last set. The last set would be 400-499, but our book ends at 488. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, instead of 10, it's 9. Therefore, total tens place 8's would be (4-1) sets of 10 and one set of 9. Wait, no. Let me think again. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's five sets. The first four are complete (each has 10 numbers), and the last one is incomplete with 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 x 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but earlier I thought 4 sets, but actually, it's five sets because 480-488 is the fifth set. So, 4 full sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 4 x 10 = 40, and the fifth set (480-488) contributes 9, so total 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, sum up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, total 8's are 97. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 177 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 80. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 48, tens 40, hundreds 89. 48+40=88, 88+89=177. For 8's: units 48, tens 49, hundreds 0. 48+49=97. 177-97=80. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. And for 4's, the hundreds place is from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's there. Units place: 48 times. Tens place: 40 times (from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449). Wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's 10 each for the four sets: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, that's five sets, each contributing 10, so 5x10=50. But earlier I thought it was 40. Wait, I must have made a mistake here. Let me correct that. So, in the tens place for 4's, from 1-488, the 4 appears in the tens place in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets x10=50. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by only counting 4 sets. So, actually, the tens place for 4's is 50, not 40. So, let me recalculate the total number of 4's. Units: 48, tens:50, hundreds:89. So, 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, total 4's are 187. Now, let's recount the 8's to see if I made a similar mistake. For 8's in the tens place, we had 49, which was correct because it included five sets: four full and one partial. So, 48 units, 49 tens, 0 hundreds, totaling 97. So, now the difference is 187-97=90. Wait, so I think I initially miscalculated the tens place for 4's. It should be 50, not 40. So, the correct number of 4's is 187, and 8's are 97, so the difference is 90. Let me confirm this again. For 4's in the tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's five sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5x10=50. So, yes, 50 in the tens place. So, total 4's: 48 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=187. 8's: 48 (units) +49 (tens)=97. So, 187-97=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make another mistake. Let's check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct. Units place: every 10 numbers, so 488/10=48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48. Tens place: five sets, each contributing 10, so 50. So, 48+50+89=187. For 8's: units place, 488/10=48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 48. Tens place: five sets, but the first four are full (10 each), and the fifth is partial (9). So, 4x10 +9=49. So, 48+49=97. So, 187-97=90. Yes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488, so 48 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers. There are 5 sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From page 400 to 488, there are 89 numbers with 4 in the hundreds place.\n\n   Total '4's = 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in sets 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four sets contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n   Total '8's = 48 (units) + 49 (tens) = 97.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's - Number of '8's = 187 - 97 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.

    "text": " So, in 1-10, it's 4; 11-20, it's 14; and so on. I need to find how many such numbers are there up to 488. The formula for the number of times a digit appears in the units place is: Number of cycles = total numbers / cycle length. Here, the cycle length is 10 (since every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9). So, for units place, the number of 4's would be total numbers divided by 10, which is 488 / 10 = 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. However, wait, I think this is a bit off because 488 is not a multiple of 10. The last cycle would be from 481 to 490, but since the book ends at 488, we have to check if the last page is beyond 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last units digit 4 would be at 484. Let me recast this. The number of 4's in the units place is the number of complete groups of 10 within 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is the 488th page, so the last group is 481-490, but 490 is beyond 488, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is within 488. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, etc. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there up to 488? Let's see: The first is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10, 240-249, another 10, and 340-349, another 10. Then, we have 440-449, which is another 10, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is part of the 400-488 range. Let me count how many complete hundreds are there. From 0-99: 40-49: 10 numbers. 100-199: 140-149: 10. 200-299: 240-249:10. 300-399: 340-349:10. 400-488: 440-449:10. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, so that's correct. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete cycles. But wait, let's check if 488 is included. The last 8 in the units place would be at 488, which is the last page. So, how many 8's in units place: Each cycle of 10 numbers contributes one 8 (e.g., 8,18,28,...488). So, the number of 8's is 488//10 = 48 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so integer division gives 48). But wait, 488 is the last page, which is 8 in the units place, so that should be included. So, 48+1=49? Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th occurrence. Let me think: The first 8 is at 8, then 18, 28,... up to 488. The number of terms in this sequence is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** A 4 appears every 10 numbers. There are 48 complete groups of 10 within 488, contributing 48 fours.\n2. **Tens place:** A 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges, each contributing 10 fours, totaling 50 fours.\n3. **Hundreds place:** A 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, contributing 89 fours.\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** An 8 appears every 10 numbers. The sequence 8, 18, ..., 488 has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** An 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. The ranges contribute 10 fours each for the first four sets and 9 for the last (480-488), totaling 49 eights.\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " So, in each set of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. How many such sets are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place, which gives 48*1 = 48. But wait, the 488th page is included, so after 480, the 481-488 pages would have 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. In this last partial set, the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, in 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: the first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), the second is 140-149 (another 10), the third is 240-249, the fourth is 340-349, and the fifth would be 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5*10 = 50. But wait, let me check: from 0-99: 40-49 is one block. Then 100-199: 140-149. 200-299: 240-249. 300-399: 340-349. 400-488: 440-449. So, that's five blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5*10=50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400 up to 488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Wait, but each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Wait, but wait, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 = 88, so plus 1 is 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. So, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units: 48 full tens (1-480), each contributing 1, so 48, plus 1 more in 484, so 49. Tens: 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, etc.), each 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Hundreds: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers in the units place. So, similar to the 4's, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. But then, the last partial set is 481-488, which includes 488, so units digit 8 appears once here as well. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such blocks are there up to 488. The first block is 80-89 (10 numbers), then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. The next would be 480-489, but since our book ends at 488, that block is only up to 488. So, how many full blocks? 80-89: yes, 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. And then 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 8's, and the last partial block contributes 9 8's. Wait, but wait, 480-488: the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, right? Because 480 is 4 8 0, 481 is 4 8 1, up to 488. So, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks *10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: from 0-99: 80-89: 10. 100-199: 180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488:9. So, yes, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of 10, contributing 48 \u00d7 1 = 48. Additionally, 484 adds one more, totaling 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks of 10 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149). There are 5 such blocks, each contributing 10, totaling 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, contributing 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers.

There are 4 full blocks contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40, and the partial block 480-488 contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, in 1-10, 4 appears once (at 4). In 11-20, it's at 14, and so on. Since the book goes up to 488, I can calculate how many full groups of 10 there are and then see if there are any extra numbers beyond that. From 1 to 488, how many full decades are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full decades (since 48*10=480) and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in each full decade, there's one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 instances. Now, in the last partial decade (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. The number 484 has a 4 in the units place, so that's one more. So total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, from 140-149, and so on. Let me figure out how many such blocks exist up to 488. The first block is 40-49: 10 numbers. The next would be 140-149: another 10. Then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So how many blocks is that? Let's see: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So that's 5 * 10 = 50. Now, after 449, the next block would be 540-549, but that's beyond 488, so we don't count that. So total 4's in the tens place: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 up to 488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, let me add up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, I'll do the same for 8's. Let me count how many times 8 appears in each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many full decades are there? 48 full decades (48*10=480) and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). Each full decade contributes one 8 in the units place, so that's 48. In the last partial decade, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100, specifically in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Let me count how many full blocks there are. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers. So that's 4 full blocks (each contributing 10 8's in the tens place) and one partial block with 9. So total 8's in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can only appear in the hundreds place if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total 8's in the hundreds place: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. But actually, in the tens place, each number from 480-488 has 8 in the tens place, right? So that's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place, so 9 8's. So that's correct. Similarly, the other blocks each have 10 numbers, so 4 blocks give 40, plus 9 gives 49. So that's correct. So, yes, the difference is 90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe I missed something. Let me check the hundreds place for 4's: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. So, 89 4's there. So, adding up, 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. For 8's, units 49, tens 49, so 98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. Wait, but let me think again about the tens place for 4's. I had 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct. So, yes, 50 4's in the tens place. So, everything adds up. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, 8's is 98, so 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers.

    "text": " So, in 1-10, it's 4; in 11-20, it's 14; and so on. How many such sets are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That's 48 times. But wait, in the last partial set, from 481 to 488, the 48th set would be 481-490, but our book stops at 488. So, in this last set, the units digit 4 would occur at 484, which is within 481-488. So, actually, it's 48 times for the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the 48th set ends at 480, and then 481-488 is the 49th set. But in 481-488, the units digit 4 occurs once (484). So, total units place 4's would be 48 (from 1-480) plus 1 (484), making it 49. Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there in this sequence? The first term is 4, the last term is 484. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is fully included. Since 449 is less than 488, yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But wait, we're only concerned with the hundreds digit being 4. Each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's do the same for 8's. I'll go through each digit position again: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's count how many terms there are. The first term is 8, the last term is 488. Common difference is 10. Number of terms: ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the 480-489 block, but only up to 488. Each block contributes 10 numbers, except possibly the last one. Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10, which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, 40 +9=49. Wait, but wait, let me check. 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, right? From 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks *10 + 9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. Wait, that's a big number. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through each digit again for 4's: Units place: 49 times. Tens place: 50 times. Hundreds place: 89 times. Total: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: Units place:49, Tens place:49, Hundreds place:0. Total:98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 is correct. For 8's, in the tens place, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 49 in total for tens place. So, yes, 98 for 8's. So, the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, totaling 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 times.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188 times.**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, except the last block (480-488) which contributes 9 numbers.\n   - Total: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 + 9 = **49 times.**\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of times: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98 times.**\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = **90.**\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, in each block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. How many such blocks are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks and then an extra 8 numbers (481-488). So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times. But wait, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digit cycles from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the block from x40 to x49, where x is any digit. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there up to 488? Well, from 1-488, there are 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 400-488. In each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears once, contributing 10 numbers each time. So, 4 hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40 occurrences. Now, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there from 400-488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through each digit position again. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers in the units place. So, in each block of 10, once. Up to 488, there are 48 full blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, units place 8's: 48 times in full blocks, and in the last partial block, 8 appears once (at 488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like x80 to x89. Each such block contributes 10 occurrences. How many full hundreds are there up to 488? 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399). In each, the tens digit 8 appears once, contributing 10 numbers each. So, 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, from 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8, so each number from 480 to 488 has 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 numbers, but actually, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we stop at 488, it's 9. Wait, but 480 is the first number, so from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them. So, that's 9 occurrences. So, total tens place 8's: 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me double-check. From 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 8's. Let me recount that. For the tens place of 8's, in each hundred, it's 10 numbers, so 4 hundreds give 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct. For the units place, in 400-488, the units digit 8 appears once at 488, so 48 full blocks (1-480) give 48, plus 1 more at 488, total 49. That seems correct. For 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times. That's correct. So, the difference is indeed 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
