    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Let me see how many such numbers there are. The first number is 4, and the last number is 484. To find how many terms are in this sequence, I can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d. Here, a_n is 484, a_1 is 4, and d is 10. So, 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 4 from both sides: 480 = (n-1)*10. Divide both sides by 10: 48 = n-1. So, n = 49. That means there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many such groups there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. Similarly, 240-249 is 10, 340-349 is 10, and 440-449 is 10. So that's 5 groups, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 occurrences. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can be 4 only in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first number is 8, the last is 488. Using the same arithmetic sequence formula: a_n = 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. Subtract 8: (n-1)*10 = 480. Divide by 10: n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last group is 480-488. Let me check each group: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 groups of 10 and 1 group of 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, there's one 4. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4. But wait, the last set would be 481-490, but since the book ends at 488, the units digit 4 appears in 484, 494, etc., but 494 is beyond 488, so actually, from 1 to 488, the number of 4's in the units place is 48. Wait, no, let me think again. Each 10 numbers have exactly one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is within 488. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. Every 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. In each of the first four hundreds, there's a block of 10 where the tens digit is 4. So that's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, that's another 10. So, total 40 + 10 = 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since our book ends at 488, it's 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. Wait, no, 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, the units digit is 8 once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. But wait, the last page is 488, so the units digit 8 appears in 488 as well. So, from 1 to 488, how many 8's in the units place? Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms? The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8. This happens in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. So, each full hundred has one block of 10 where the tens digit is 8. There are four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), so the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the units place for 4's again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first 4 is at 4, then 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many terms? The sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The nth term is 10n - 6. Wait, no, 4 + 10(n-1) = 10n - 6. Wait, that might not be the best way. Alternatively, the number of terms is floor((488 - 4)/10) + 1. So, (488 - 4)/10 = 484/10 = 48.4, so floor is 48, plus 1 is 49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, that's conflicting. Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount. The units digit 4 occurs at 4,14,24,...,484. So, the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, actually, it's 49 times, not 48. So, I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought it was 48. So, units place for 4's: 49. Then, tens place for 4's: 50, as before. Hundreds place: 89. So, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, but earlier I had 187, but that was because I thought units was 48. So, correcting that, units is 49, so total 4's is 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, for 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, so total 98. So, difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, so now I'm getting a different answer. Hmm, so where did I go wrong earlier? Let me check again. Units place for 4's: from 4 to 484, step 10. Number of terms: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times. So, I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought it was 48. So, total 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98. So, difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, so the correct answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. But let me check the tens place for 4's again. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so yes, 5 blocks. So, 50. So, 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. 8's: units 49, tens 49, so 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, how many numbers? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times. That's correct. So, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 188. 8's: units 49, tens 49, total 98. So, difference is 90. Therefore, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 488, the sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks within 488 pages.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 times.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 488, the sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers).\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many such blocks are there? Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, that means there are 48 full blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). Each full block contributes one 4, so that's 48 times. Now, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484). So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, etc. Each of these ranges contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Let me calculate how many such ranges there are. From 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, meaning there are 4 full hundreds and a partial hundred. Each full hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 4 full hundreds give 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, that's 10 more. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, right? So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me check again. From 1-100: 40-49 \u2192 10 4's. 101-200: 140-149 \u2192 10 4's. 201-300: 240-249 \u2192 10 4's. 301-400: 340-349 \u2192 10 4's. Then, 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 4's. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. Wait, but 400-488 is only up to 488, so 440-449 is within that. So, yes, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, each of these numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the last partial block is 481-488, which includes 488, so units digit 8 appears once (488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last partial set. Each full range (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.) contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let me count how many full ranges there are. From 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, meaning 4 full hundreds and a partial hundred. Each full hundred has one range where the tens digit is 8, contributing 10 8's. So, 4 full hundreds: 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), but only the tens digit is 8, so each of these 9 numbers contributes an 8 in the tens place. Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9. So, 9 8's in the tens place from 480-488. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, when counting the 4's in the tens place, I considered 5 sets: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each contributes 10 4's, so 5*10=50. That seems right.\n\nFor the 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's there.\n\nUnits place: 49 4's, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. Total 4's: 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nFor 8's: Units place: 49, tens place: 40 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 from 480-488, so 40+9=49. Hundreds place: 0. So, total 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check the 4's in the tens place again. From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's think differently: each hundred has 10 occurrences, so 1-100: 10, 101-200:10, 201-300:10, 301-400:10, and 401-488: 10 (from 440-449). So, that's 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place: 1-100:10 (80-89), 101-200:10 (180-189), 201-300:10 (280-289), 301-400:10 (380-389), and 401-488:9 (480-488). So, 4*10=40 plus 9=49. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 4: every 10 numbers, so 48 full tens (480) plus 484, so 48+1=49. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 8: same logic, 48 full tens plus 488, so 48+1=49.\n\nHundreds place: 4's have 89, 8's have 0.\n\nSo, 4's total: 49+50+89=188.\n\n8's total: 49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check the 4's in the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the hundreds place, since 800 is beyond 488, there are none. So, 0.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** Every 10 numbers have one '4'. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades (480 numbers) plus the last 8 numbers (481-488). Each full decade contributes one '4', so 48. The last partial decade (481-488) includes 484, adding one more. Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens place:** Every 100 numbers have a block of 10 where the tens digit is '4' (e.g., 40-49).

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, in every block of 10 numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. But wait, since the book ends at 488, the last block is 481-488, which is only 8 numbers. Let me calculate how many complete blocks of 10 there are and then check the last partial block. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 numbers. So, in each complete block, 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the partial block from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once in the units place here as well (484). So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, from 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10 times, and so on. Let me figure out how many such blocks there are up to 488. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds and a partial hundred from 401-488. Each complete hundred contributes 10 times 4 in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8. So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so another 10 times. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the page numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, but with 8's. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Each block of 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Now, the last partial block is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. The units digits here are 1-8, so 8 appears once (488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, counting 8's in the tens place. Each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, up to 488, how many such blocks are there? 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds and a partial hundred. Each complete hundred contributes 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times 8 in the tens place. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in page numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that can't be right because 188 - 98 is 90, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the 4's in the tens place. Let me double-check that. For the 4's in the tens place, I considered each hundred block contributing 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40, and then in the partial block 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, 40 + 10 = 50. That seems correct. For the 8's in the tens place, I had 40 from the complete hundreds and 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. So, 4's total 188, 8's total 98, so 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have overcounted the 4's in the hundreds place. Let me check: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the hundreds place differently. Wait, another approach: for the hundreds place, only numbers from 400 to 488 have 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times. So, that's correct. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but when I think about it, the difference is 90. But I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to make off-by-one errors. Let me recount the 4's and 8's again more carefully.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: Every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8. So, 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, the last partial ten is 481-488, which includes 484, so +1. Total 49.\n- Tens place: Every 100 numbers, 10 times. So, 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in the last partial hundred, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so +10. Total 50.\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so +89.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: Similar to 4's, 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Last partial ten is 481-488, which includes 488, so +1. Total 49.\n- Tens place: Every 100 numbers, 10 times. So, 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in the last partial hundred, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, +9. Total 49.\n- Hundreds place: None, as the book ends at 488.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm thinking, maybe I should check if the last partial block for 4's in the tens place is correctly accounted for. From 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. Similarly, for 8's in the tens place, from 400-488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 complete groups of 10 (48 occurrences) + 1 in 484 \u2192 Total: 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 complete groups of 100 (40 occurrences) + 10 in 440-449 \u2192 Total: 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 numbers from 400-488 \u2192 Total: 89.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 complete groups of 10 (48 occurrences) + 1 in 488 \u2192 Total: 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 complete groups of 100 (40 occurrences) + 9 in 480-488 \u2192 Total: 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** None \u2192 Total: 0.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full groups of 10, and then there's a remainder of 8. So, in each group of 10, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. Therefore, 48 times 1 is 48, but wait, I think I need to check if the 48th group ends at 480, so the next group would be 481-490, but since the book only goes up to 488, the 48th group would actually have 488 as the last page. So, in the units place, the 4 appears 48 times? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let me think differently. For the units place, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, total number of 4's in units place is floor(488/10) = 48 times. Wait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, but actually, from 1 to 480, that's 48 times, and then from 481 to 488, there's no 4 in the units place because 484 is within that range, right? Wait, 484 is 484, so that's another 4 in the units place. So, actually, it's 48 + 1 = 49 times? Wait, no, because 480 is the last multiple of 10 before 488, so from 1 to 480, it's 48 times, and then from 481 to 488, 484 is within that range, so that's one more, making it 49. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there up to 488? Let's see: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Now, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 times. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is fully included. Since 449 is less than 488, yes, so 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400 to 488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, so that's 89 numbers where the hundreds digit is 4. So, that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, but let's check. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is included, so the last one is 488. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? It's 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full times, but since 488 is included, that's actually 49 times. Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th term. Let me check: 8,18,...,488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, (n-1)*10 = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. The ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, and the last one (480-488) has 9 numbers. So, total number of 8's in the tens place is 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (including 484).\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n  \nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (including 488).\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last range being 480-488 (9 numbers), totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, like 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Let me calculate how many such numbers there are. The last number with 4 in the units place is 484, which is 484 = 40*12 + 4, but maybe a better way is to divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So that's 48 times. Wait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so it's 48 full groups, each contributing a 4, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is within 488. So yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, contributing 10 numbers. Then 100-199: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, another 10. 300-399: 340-349, another 10. 400-488: 440-449, which is another 10, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is all within 488. So that's five ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. Hmm, but wait, let me check: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: 10, 240-249: 10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. Yes, that's 5 ranges, so 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, in each of these, the hundreds digit is 4. So that's 89 times. Wait, but I'm only counting the hundreds digit, so each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. So total number of 4's is units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. Wait, that can't be right because 187 seems high. Let me check again. Wait, no, that's the total number of 4's. Wait, 48 in units, 50 in tens, 89 in hundreds, so 48+50=98, 98+89=187. Hmm, seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The last one is 488, which is 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? That's 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so does that add an extra? Let me see: 1-480, that's 480 numbers, so 480/10=48 numbers ending with 8. Then 488 is the 489th number, which is 488, so that's another 8 in the units place. So total units place 8's: 48 +1=49? Wait, no, because 488 is included in the 488 numbers. Wait, 488 is the 488th page, so 488 is the last page. So, how many numbers end with 8 up to 488? Let's see: 8,18,...,488. So, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. Let me count how many such ranges. From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189, another 10. 200-299: 280-289, another 10. 300-399: 380-389, another 10. 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place, that's 4 ranges of 10 and one range of 9. So total is 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but each of these contributes how many 8's in the tens place? For each range, it's 10 numbers except the last one, which is 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. So total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that seems correct? Wait, let me double-check my counts. For 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. 48+50=98, +89=187. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct because 488-400+1=89. So, yes, that's correct. And for the 8's in the tens place, I had 4 ranges of 10 and one range of 9, totaling 49. That seems correct. Units place for 8's: 49 numbers ending with 8. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds. Total 98. So, 187-98=89.

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let me divide 488 by 10. That gives 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. In each of these 48 blocks, there's one 4, so that's 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so there's no 4 in the units place here. So, total 4's in the units place: 48. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can also appear in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, how many full hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, the next block is 401-488. Here, the tens digit is 4 for the numbers 401-410. Wait, no, actually, 401-410 would have tens digit 0, but 410-419 would have tens digit 1, right? Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me correct that. The tens digit is 4 in the block 400-499, but since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit 4 appears from 400-409. That's 10 numbers: 400, 401, ..., 409. So, that's another 10 4's. Therefore, total 4's in the tens place: 40 (from the four hundreds) + 10 (from 400-409) = 50. Wait, but 400-409 is part of the 400-499 block, which is the fifth hundred. So, actually, the first four hundreds (1-400) contribute 4*10=40, and then 400-488 adds another 10 (from 400-409). So, total 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, let me add up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. From 1-488, how many full blocks of 10 are there? 48 full blocks (since 488 / 10 = 48.8). Each block contributes one 8, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once (at 488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Now, in the fifth hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488. That's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's 9 8's. Therefore, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place, but since our book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400-488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (once every 10 numbers, 48 full blocks of 10).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (10 in each of the first four hundreds, plus 10 in 400-409).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488).\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = **187**.\n\n**Counting the 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (48 in full blocks, plus one in 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (40 in the first four hundreds, plus 9 in 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **89**.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many times does this happen? From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full cycles of 10, and then 8 extra numbers. In each full cycle, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, the last partial cycle is from 481 to 488. In this partial cycle, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once in this partial cycle as well (484). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place (second digit from the right):** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 1 to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're dealing with three-digit numbers, the hundreds digit starts from 1. Wait, actually, when considering the tens place, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for numbers 1-99), 1, 2, 3, or 4. But in reality, the hundreds digit is 0 only for numbers 1-99, which are two-digit numbers. So, let's see: - For hundreds digit 0 (pages 1-99), the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. - For hundreds digit 1 (pages 100-199), the tens digit 4 appears in 140-149, another 10 numbers. - Similarly, for hundreds digit 2 (200-299), 240-249: 10 numbers. - For hundreds digit 3 (300-399), 340-349: 10 numbers. - For hundreds digit 4 (400-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's fine. So, each hundreds block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many hundreds blocks are there? From 0 to 4, that's 5 blocks. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 numbers = 50 times. But wait, let me double-check. For the hundreds digit 4, the block is 400-488, and the tens digit 4 runs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 50 in total. 3. **Hundreds place (third digit from the right):** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, I'm only counting the digit 4 in the hundreds place. Each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. The problem is about how many times the digit 4 is printed, not how many numbers have a 4 in a particular place. So, each number from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. But wait, let me check: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. So, total number of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, 49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99, plus 89 (hundreds) = 188. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, in the partial cycle (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 8 appears once more (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's calculate: - For hundreds digit 0 (pages 1-99), the tens digit 8 appears in 80-89: 10 numbers. - For hundreds digit 1 (100-199), 180-189: 10 numbers. - For hundreds digit 2 (200-299), 280-289: 10 numbers. - For hundreds digit 3 (300-399), 380-389: 10 numbers. - For hundreds digit 4 (400-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers? Wait, 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, in the hundreds digit 4 block, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me confirm: hundreds digits 0,1,2,3 each contribute 10, so 4\u00d710=40, and hundreds digit 4 contributes 9, so total 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place 8's: 0. So, total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. Difference: 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me think again. Wait, when counting the tens place for 4's, I considered 5 blocks (0-4), each contributing 10, so 50. But for 8's, in the tens place, I had 4 blocks contributing 10 each, and the last block contributing 9, totaling 49. So, that seems correct. Similarly, for the hundreds place, 4's have 89, 8's have 0. So, yes, 188 vs 98, difference of 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, contributing 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, contributing 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, for every set of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, the total number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete sets of 10 in 488. Let me calculate that. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10. But wait, 48 times 10 is 480, so from 1 to 480, there are 48 sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. So, total 4's in units place: 48. But wait, I think I might be missing something. Because in each set of 10, the 4 appears once, so 48 sets would give 48 times. So, 48 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, from 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set would be 440-449, since 450-488 is beyond that. Let me count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each hundred block (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) will have a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 40-49: 10 times. From 140-149: another 10. From 240-249: another 10. From 340-349: another 10. From 440-449: another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 times. So, 5 times 10 is 50. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's printed: 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, similar to 4. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Again, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets. Each set contributes one 8, so 48 times. But wait, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 8 appears once more. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers every 100. So, from 80-89: 10 times. From 180-189: another 10. From 280-289: another 10. From 380-389: another 10. From 480-488: here, the tens digit is 8, but how many numbers are there? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers. So, that's 9 times instead of 10. So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 4*10 = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through each part again. **Counting 4's:**\n- Units place: 48 times. Because 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 in units place. From 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so no additional 4 in units place. So, 48 is correct.\n- Tens place: 5 sets of 10 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). Each contributes 10, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times. Correct.\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems right.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- Units place: 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, from 481-488, units digit 8 appears once (at 488), so total 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n- Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers). So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 0. Correct.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.

There are 4 such sets, contributing 40 times, plus 9 times in 480-488.\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, there's one 4. So, from 1 to 480, that's 480/10 = 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so no additional 4 in the units place. So, total 4's in units place: 48. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each of these sets has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's figure out how many such sets there are. From 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is okay. So that's four sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40. So, 40 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 40 = 88; 88 + 89 = 177. So, 177 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. From 1 to 488, that's 488 / 10 = 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction, we take the integer part. Wait, actually, from 1 to 488, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48, but let me check. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 8, and then in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place. Wait, let me confirm: from 1-10: 8 at 8; 11-20: 18; ... 481-488: 488. So, yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in sets like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each set contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's see how many such sets there are up to 488. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in the following ranges: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). Then, 480-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), but the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them because 480 is 4-8-0, so the tens digit is 8. Wait, no, 480 is 4-8-0, so the tens digit is 8. Similarly, 481 is 4-8-1, so tens digit 8, up to 488, which is 4-8-8. So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, that's an additional 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, so 4\u00d710=40, plus the 9 from 480-488, so 40+9=49. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, so is that a separate set? Let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, 80-89. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. Then, 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total 4\u00d710 +9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Wait, that can't be right because 49+49=98, but let me double-check. Units: 49, Tens:49, so total 98 8's. Wait, but earlier, when counting 4's, I got 177. So, the difference would be 177 - 98 = 79. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 8's. Let me recount the units place: from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The last term is 488, which is 8 + 10*(n-1) =488. So, 10*(n-1)=480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 times. That's correct. Now, tens place: as above, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total 49 in tens place. So, total 8's: 49+49=98. Now, 4's total: 177. So, 177-98=79. Therefore, there are 79 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For example, in the hundreds place, 4's go from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. For 8's, since 800 is beyond 488, no 8's in hundreds place. Units and tens seem correct. So, the difference is 79. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of 10, contributing 48 4's. The last partial set (481-488) doesn't add more 4's in the units place. Total: 48.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place in sets like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are four such sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 4's. Total: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Total: 89.\n**Total 4's:** 48 + 40 + 89 = 177.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (including 488). Total: 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in sets like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are four full sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 8's, and an additional 9 from 480-488. Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488. Total: 0.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 177 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 79.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{79}"

    "text": " So from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many such blocks are there? Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks and then 8 more numbers in the 489th block (481-488). Each full block contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the incomplete block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once in this block as well (484). So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, from 1 to 488, how many such blocks are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then the 401-488 block. Each full block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, in the 401-488 block, the tens digit is 4 for the entire block (from 401 to 488). How many numbers is that? From 401 to 488, that's 88 numbers, but since we're only considering the tens place, it's 10 numbers for each hundred, but wait, in this case, it's from 401-488, which is 88 numbers, so the tens digit is 4 for all of them. Wait, no, actually, the tens digit is 0-9 in each hundred. Wait, no, in the 401-488 block, the tens digit is 0-8 for 401-488, but since we're looking for when the tens digit is 4, that would be 440-449. So, that's 10 numbers. So, in the 401-488 block, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total 4's in the tens place: 40 (from the first four blocks) + 10 = 50. Wait, but let me check: the first four blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) each have 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4\u00d710=40. Then, in the 401-488 block, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so another 10. So total 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. From 1-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 4's in the hundreds place. So, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many full blocks of 10 are there? 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48. Then, in the incomplete block (481-488), the units digits go from 1-8, so 8 appears once (488). So total 8's in units place: 48 +1=49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8's in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.). From 1-488, how many full blocks of 100 are there? 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4\u00d710=40. Now, in the 401-488 block, the tens digit is 8 for numbers 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8? Wait, from 1-488, the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's there. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times in each block of 100, totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears 89 times in the range 400-488.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears 10 times in each block of 100 and 9 times in the incomplete block, totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every set of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one number ending with 4. So, the total number of 4's in the units place would be the number of complete tens in 488. Let me calculate that. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, that would be from 1-480, right? Then, from 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so 484 is the last number ending with 4 in that range. So, that's 48 times in the units place. Wait, but actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full tens and then 8 extra numbers. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1? No, wait, no. Because each ten has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, 488 pages mean 48 full tens (1-480) and then 8 more pages (481-488). So, in the 48 full tens, we have 48 times 4 in the units place. Then, in the last 8 pages, 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, from 1-480, there are 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48. Then, from 481-488, which is 8 numbers, the units digits go from 1-8, so 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 40-49 (that's 40-49, which is 10 numbers), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 1-488, right? 440-449 is 10 numbers, and 450-488 comes after. So, how many blocks of 100 are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, in each of the first four centuries (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), there's a block where the tens digit is 4: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349. That's four blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 4's in the tens place. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 40 from the first four centuries and 10 from the last partial century, making 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. That happens from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. So, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99; 99+89=188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, but let's go through it again. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48. Then, from 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so 488 is the only one ending with 8 in that range. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks are in 1-488. 80-89: yes, that's one block (10 numbers). Then 180-189: another block. 280-289: another. 380-389: another. Now, 480-488: the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, the tens digit is 8 in all these numbers, but the units digits vary. So, how many 8's in the tens place here? From 480-488, the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 4*10=40, plus the 9 from 480-488, so total 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only has 488 pages, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's: 188, total 8's:98. Difference: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because 188 - 98 is 90, but I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit place again for both 4's and 8's to ensure accuracy. For 4's: Units place: 48 full tens (1-480) with one 4 each, so 48, plus 484, so 49. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each with 10, so 5*10=50. Wait, earlier I thought 4 blocks, but actually, 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. So, that's correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. For 8's: Units place: 48 full tens, 48, plus 488, so 49. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, totaling 4*10 +9=49. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49+49=98. Therefore, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 48 full sets of 10 (1-480) contribute 48 fours, plus one more in 484, totaling 49.\n2. **Tens place:** Five blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449) each contribute 10 fours, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 contribute 89 fours.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 48 full sets of 10 contribute 48 eights, plus one in 488, totaling 49.\n2. **Tens place:** Four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 40 eights, plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No eights since the book doesn't reach 800.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, I can calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488. Dividing 488 by 10 gives me 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups and a partial group. Each complete group contributes one 4 in the units place. So, that's 48 fours. Now, the partial group is from 481 to 488. The units digit in this group is 1 to 8, so 484 is within this range. That's another 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 1 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. Now, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 page numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's calculate how many such numbers there are. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning 48 complete groups and a partial group. Each complete group gives one 8 in the units place, so 48 eights. The partial group is 481-488, and the units digit here goes up to 8, so 488 is included. That's another 8 in the units place. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let me check each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights. - 180-189: 10 eights. - 280-289: 10 eights. - 380-389: 10 eights. - 480-488: Since 488 is the last page, this range has 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, 9 eights in the tens place here. So, total tens place 8's: 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9, so 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct. For 8's: units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. 49 + 49 = 98. Correct. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. The last range for tens place 8's is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one range of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 = 40, plus 9 is 49. That's correct. Similarly, for the 4's in the hundreds place: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 48 complete groups of 10 (48\u00d710=480) plus one more in 484, totaling 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range contributes 10, totaling 5\u00d710=50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 48 complete groups of 10 plus one more in 488, totaling 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last range contributes 9, totaling 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in any page number up to 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, I can divide 488 by 10 to find how many complete groups of 10 there are. 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups and a partial group of 8 numbers. In each complete group, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, that's 48 fours. Now, in the partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the number 484 has a 4 in the units place. That's one more 4. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's look at the tens place. The 4 appears in the tens place for a block of 10 numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 fours in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, 488 \u00f7 100 = 4.88, which means there are 4 complete hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and a partial hundred (400-488). In each complete hundred, there's exactly one block where the tens digit is 4, contributing 10 fours. So, 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 fours. Now, in the partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 4 in the block 440-449. That's another 10 fours. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, no, hold on. Wait, in the partial hundred, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 fours. So, total tens place fours: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 10 from the partial block, making it 50. Hmm, that seems correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total 4's in hundreds place: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll go through each digit position similarly. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups and a partial group of 8 numbers. Each complete group has one 8 in the units place, so 48 eights. In the partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the number 488 has an 8 in the units place. That's one more 8. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each complete block (like 80-89) contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, 488 \u00f7 100 = 4.88, meaning 4 complete hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and a partial hundred (400-488). In each complete hundred, there's exactly one block where the tens digit is 8, contributing 10 eights. So, 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 eights. Now, in the partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480-488) but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, how many eights in the tens place here? Each of these 9 numbers has an 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 eights. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's in hundreds place: 0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me recount the 4's and 8's again, perhaps I overcounted or undercounted somewhere.\n\nFirst, 4's:\n\n- Units place: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the partial group (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 484 is included, adding 1 more. So, 49 units place 4's.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred has one block of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers), 100-199: 140-149, 200-299: 240-249, 300-399: 340-349. That's 4 blocks \u00d710 =40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 more, making total tens place 4's: 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 488 - 400 +1=89 numbers, each with a 4 in hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89= 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units place: 488 \u00f710=48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the partial group (481-488), the units digit reaches 8 at 488, so 1 more. Total units place 8's:49.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred has one block where tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks \u00d710=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but in the tens place, it's the second digit. So, 480-489 would be the tens digit 8, but our book stops at 488. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 more. So, total tens place 8's:40+9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: As before, none, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I feel like maybe I'm overcounting in the tens place for 4's. Let me check again.\n\nIn the tens place for 4's: Each hundred from 0-99, 100-199, etc., each has a block of 10 where tens digit is 4. So, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349. That's four blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So, 40+10=50. That's correct.\n\nFor 8's in tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: 4 blocks \u00d710=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 40+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 90. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4's appear every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4, totaling 48. The partial group (481-488) includes 484, adding one more 4. Total: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 4's appear in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block contributes 10 fours. There are 4 complete blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), totaling 40. The block 440-449 in the 400-488 range adds another 10. Total: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4's appear from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Total: 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8's appear every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8, totaling 48. The partial group (481-488) includes 488, adding one more 8. Total: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8's appear in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block contributes 10 eights. There are 4 complete blocks, totaling 40. The block 480-488 adds 9 eights. Total: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's appear since the book ends at 488. Total: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of such blocks. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, that means there are 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 4. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the 488th page is included. Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so the 48th block ends at 480, and then we have pages 481 to 488. In the units place, the 4 would have been in 484, which is within the 481-490 range, but since the book ends at 488, 484 is included. So, actually, there are 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, but when I think about it, from 1 to 488, the number of 4's in the units place is indeed 48 because each 10-number block contributes one, and 488 is the 48th block (since 48*10=480, and 480+8=488). So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. Each time the tens digit is 4, which happens in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within the range, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so the last block is 440-449. Let me count how many full blocks of 100 there are. From 1 to 488, the hundreds digit goes from 0 (for 1-99) to 4 (for 400-488). So, for the tens place, the 4 appears in each hundred block. Let's see: - In the first hundred (1-99), the tens digit is 4 in 40-49: that's 10 numbers, so 10 times. - In the second hundred (100-199), the tens digit is 4 in 140-149: another 10 times. - Similarly, in the third hundred (200-299), it's 240-249: 10 times. - In the fourth hundred (300-399), it's 340-349: 10 times. - Now, in the fifth hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449: that's 10 times, but wait, 449 is within 488, so yes, 10 times. So, each hundred contributes 10 times, and there are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only part of the fifth hundred. However, the tens digit being 4 occurs in 440-449, which is entirely within 400-488, so that's 10 times. Therefore, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 5 times 10, which is 50. Wait, but let me check: 1-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 4's in tens place. 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10. 200-299: 240-249 \u219210. 300-399: 340-349 \u219210. 400-488: 440-449 \u219210. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. That seems right. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. This occurs from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. Wait, but I'm supposed to count how many times the digit 4 appears, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 48+50=98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, let's check: the last page is 488, which ends with an 8, so that would be the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8. This occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. - In the first hundred (1-99), the tens digit is 8 in 80-89: 10 times. - In the second hundred (100-199), it's 180-189: 10 times. - Third hundred (200-299): 280-289:10 times. - Fourth hundred (300-399): 380-389:10 times. - Fifth hundred (400-488): 480-488: here, the tens digit is 8, but the units digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, the tens digit is 8 in all these, so that's 9 times. Therefore, total 8's in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. Wait, let me confirm: 1-99: 10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, 10*4=40 plus 9 is 49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. This occurs from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 times. So, total 8's: units place (48) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 48+49=97. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90. Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check my calculations because 187-97 is 90, but I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each step again. For 4's: units place: 48, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total: 48+50=98, +89=187. That seems correct. For 8's: units:48, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total:48+49=97. So, 187-97=90. Hmm, but I have a feeling I might have overcounted the hundreds place for 4's. Wait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. For 8's, in the tens place, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 10 in each hundred except the last one, which has 9. So, 49 in total. So, 48+49=97. So, 187-97=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me think again. When counting the units place for 4's, I had 48. Let me confirm: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Correct. Similarly, for 8's in units place: same logic, 48 times. For tens place: 4's had 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10, so 50. 8's had 4 full blocks (1-399) contributing 10 each, and the last block (400-488) contributing 9, so 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 4's had 89, 8's had 0. So, 187-97=90. So, yes, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - Occurs once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total: 488 / 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Occurs in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 times, and there are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Occurs from 400 to 488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total: 89 times.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - Occurs once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total: 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - First four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0 times.\n\n**Total 8's:** 48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **97**\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = **90**\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Well, every 10 numbers, there's exactly one number ending with 4. So, from 1-480, that's 48 sets of 10, so 48 numbers ending with 4. Then, 484 is the 49th. So, yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then, 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4. This happens from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Wait, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is indeed 4 for all 89 numbers. So, 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is included. So, how many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the formula: ((488 -8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This occurs in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, each of these ranges has 10 numbers except the last one, which has 9 numbers (from 480 to 488). Let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. That would be from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449, each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 (9 numbers), totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every set of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of 4's in the units place would be the number of complete tens in 488. Let me calculate that: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, we take the integer part, which is 48. So, 48 times. But wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of 4's in the units place is indeed 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. Each set of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many such sets are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds. Each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40. But wait, let me check the last partial hundred. From 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10. So, total 40 +10=50? Wait, no, because 400-488 includes the 400-488 range, but the tens digit is 4 only from 400-409, which is 10 numbers, right? Wait, no, 400-488 includes 400-488, so the tens digit being 4 is from 400-409, which is 10 numbers, so that's another 10. So, from 1-400, how many 4's in the tens place? Each hundred has 10, so 4 hundreds would have 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, it's another 10, so total 50. Wait, but 400-488 is part of the same set, so actually, it's 5 sets of 100? No, 488 is less than 500, so it's only 4 full hundreds plus the 400-488 part. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each 100 numbers, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 401-410, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10. So, total 40+10=50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's. Wait, no, that's not right. Each number from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. So, 48 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, for 10 numbers each time. So, from 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Each hundred contributes 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) contribute 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total 40+9=49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, the total number of 8's is 48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers within each hundred, totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, totaling 89 times.\n   \nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers within each hundred and additionally from 480 to 488, totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   \nTotal 8's = 48 + 49 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, there's a 4. So, for each ten numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, I can calculate the total number by dividing 488 by 10. 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, we'll take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but let me check: from 1 to 488, the last group is 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the last 4 in the units place is 484. So, that's 48 times. But wait, actually, when you divide 488 by 10, you get 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then 8 more pages (481-488), which don't include another 4 in the units place. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. How often does that happen? Every 100 numbers, the digit in the tens place cycles from 0 to 9. So, for each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 consecutive numbers (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, from 1 to 488, how many such groups are there? Let's see: the hundreds go from 0 to 4 (since 488 is in the 400s). For each hundred, there's one group where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 hundreds (0-4), but wait, actually, the hundreds start at 1 for page 100. Hmm, maybe it's better to think of it as from 0 to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488). So, in each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9, so each hundred has exactly 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. But wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 only up to 449, right? Because 450-488 would have tens digits 5-8. So, actually, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, except maybe the last one, we have 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, let's count: - 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. - 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. - 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. - 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. - 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 groups, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 50 in total. So, the tens place contributes 50 4's. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, let's check the last group: 481-490, but since we go up to 488, the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 in the tens place occurs every 100 numbers, for 10 consecutive numbers (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, how many such groups are there up to 488? Let's see: - 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. - 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. - 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. - 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. - 400-488: 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 4 groups of 10 and 1 group of 9. So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 8's. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, total 8's: 97. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 187. For 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 97. So, 187 - 97 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for 4's and 8's. For 4's in tens place: from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50. Correct. For 8's in tens place: from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four are 10 each, so 40, and the last is 9, so total 49. Correct. Units place for both is 48, correct. Hundreds place for 4's is 89, correct. Hundreds place for 8's is 0, correct. So, 187 - 97 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, and hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.) in each hundred.\n   - There are 5 such groups (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n   - Each group contributes 10 occurrences, except the last group, which is fully included (440-449).\n   - Total occurrences: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - Total occurrences: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total 4's:**\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\n- **Total:** \\( 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.) in each hundred.\n   - There are 4 full groups (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 occurrences.\n   - The last group (400-488) contributes 9 occurrences (480-488).\n   - Total occurrences: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:**\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\n- **Total:** \\( 48 + 49 + 0 = 97 \\).\n\n**Difference:**\n- More 4's than 8's: \\( 187 - 97 = 90 \\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every set of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one number ending with 4. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) in 488. To calculate that, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives me 48 complete decades and a remainder of 8. So, 48 times 1 is 48, but wait, I think I need to check if the last partial decade (481-488) includes a 4 in the units place. Let's see, 484 is in that range, so that's one more. So, total 4's in units place would be 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, no, that's not right. Because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but the last partial decade is 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, 484 is the only number with 4 in the units place in that last partial decade. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 140-149 (10) From 200-299: 240-249 (10) From 300-399: 340-349 (10) From 400-488: 440-449 (10) Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for page numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, let me add up all the 4's: Units place: 49, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. Total 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades. Each contributes one 8 in the units place, so 48. But check the last partial decade: 481-488. The numbers ending with 8 here are 488. So, that's one more. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last block. Let's count how many full blocks there are. From 0-99: 80-89 (10) From 100-199: 180-189 (10) From 200-299: 280-289 (10) From 300-399: 380-389 (10) From 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (from 80-89, etc.) plus 9 from 480-488. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, total 8's: Units place:49, Tens place:49, Hundreds place:0. Total 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, when I calculated the units place for 4's, I got 49, and for 8's, also 49. That seems correct because each digit from 0-9 appears equally in the units place across complete decades, plus the partial decade.\n\nFor the tens place, for 4's, I had 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, etc.), each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. For 8's, I had 4 full blocks (80-89, etc.) and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place, 4's: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. 8's: none, so 0.\n\nSo, 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\n8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because I remember sometimes when counting digits, especially in higher places, there might be overlaps or miscounts. Let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 is correct.\n\nFor the tens place of 4's: 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nFor the 8's in tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nUnits place: for both 4 and 8, 49 each. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the units place for 4's. Let me recount that. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there in this sequence?\n\nThe first term is 4, last term is 484. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, correct.\n\nSimilarly for 8's in units place: 8,18,28,...,488. The last term is 488. So, number of terms: ((488-8)/10)+1=(480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nSo, the total counts seem accurate. Therefore, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Let's see how many such numbers there are. Starting from 4, each subsequent number is 10 more. So, the first number is 4, and the last number before 488 would be 484. To find how many terms are in this sequence, I can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: a_n = a_1 + (n-1)*d, where d is the common difference (which is 10 here). So, 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10. Subtracting 4 from both sides: 480 = (n-1)*10. Dividing both sides by 10: 48 = n-1. Adding 1: n = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which would be in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 40-49: that's one block. Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's a total of 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50 occurrences. Wait, but I should check if the last block, 440-449, is entirely within 488. Since 449 is less than 488, yes, it's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Let's see how many numbers that is. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 occurrences of the digit 4. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through each place again. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same arithmetic sequence formula: a_n = 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, 8 + 10(n-1) = 488. Subtracting 8: 10(n-1) = 480. Dividing by 10: n-1 = 48. So, n = 49. Wait, but 488 is included, so that's correct. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). Let me count each block. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9. So, total in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, then each subsequent block is 10, but 480-488 is only 9. So, 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9: 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 occurrences of the digit 8. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For the 4's: units place: 4,14,...,484. Let me see: 484 is the last one. So, from 4 to 484, how many terms? The formula is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Correct. For the 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488. Let me check the last term. 488 is included, so the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49 + 49 = 98. Correct. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly for 4? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That's correct. For 8's, in the hundreds place, there are none because 800 is beyond 488. So, yes, 0. So, the total for 4's is 188, 8's is 98. 188 - 98 = 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every set of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of 4's in the units place would be the number of complete sets of 10 in 488, which is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a set, we take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but wait a second, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in each set of 10, there's exactly one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, in the last partial set (481-488), does 484 have a 4 in the units place? Yes, 484 ends with 4, so that's another one. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. Let's think about how often that happens. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in the numbers 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, in each block of 100, there are 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, since the book has 488 pages, we can think of it as 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, for each hundred block, there are 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, let's check the last partial block from 401-488. The tens digit is 4 in the numbers 440-449. That's another 10 numbers, so 10 more 4's. So, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, let me add up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through each place again: 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many 8's in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), 488 ends with 8, so that's another one. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. Again, each block of 100 has numbers where the tens digit is 8, specifically 80-89 in each block. So, each hundred block contributes 10 8's in the tens place. There are 4 full hundred blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10, so 4\u00d710=40. Now, in the last partial block (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 98 8's. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 full sets of 10 and an additional 4 in 484, totaling 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each block of 100.

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, like 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. To find how many such numbers there are, I can divide 488 by 10 and take the integer part. 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of 10. But wait, in each group, the units digit 4 appears exactly once. So, that's 48 times. But wait, does 488 include 484? Yes, because 484 is less than 488. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there? From 0 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges. Each has 10 numbers, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? 449 is less than 488, so yes, that's valid. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This occurs in page numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 page numbers. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 4 appears 187 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. Again, units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me calculate how many times. 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 48 times. Wait, but 488 itself is page 488, so the units digit is 8. So, that's included in the 48, right? Because 488 is the 49th occurrence? Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th group if we count starting from 0. Wait, maybe I should think differently. Let me list the numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. The first is 8, which is 8 = 8\u00d71, then 18=8\u00d72 + 2? Wait, no, better to think of it as numbers ending with 8. The last such number is 488, which is 8\u00d761, because 8\u00d761=488. Wait, but 8\u00d761 is 488, so how many numbers ending with 8 are there up to 488? It's 61 numbers because 8\u00d71=8, 8\u00d72=16, ..., 8\u00d761=488. Wait, but 8\u00d761 is 488, so that's 61 numbers. But wait, 8\u00d761 is 488, which is the last page. So, that would mean 61 times. But earlier, I thought it was 48 because 488 \u00f710=48.8, so 48 times. Hmm, I'm confused. Let me check with smaller numbers. From 1 to 80, how many 8's in units place? 8,18,28,...,78,88. Wait, 80 is 8\u00d710, so 88 is 8\u00d711, which is 88, but 80 is included as 80. So, from 1 to 88, how many 8's in units place? 8,18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88: that's 9 numbers, which is 88 \u00f710 = 8.8, so 8 full groups, but since 88 is included, it's 9. So, perhaps the formula is floor((n + 1)/10). Let me test that. For n=88, floor((88 +1)/10)=floor(89/10)=8. Hmm, that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe it's (n // 10) + 1 if n mod 10 >=8. Wait, maybe a better approach is to calculate how many full tens are there, and then see if the last number is beyond that. So, for units digit 8 up to 488: The first number is 8, the last is 488. The number of such numbers is ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = (480 /10) +1 = 48 +1=49. Wait, that makes sense because 8 to 488 is 480 numbers apart, divided by 10 steps, so 48 intervals, which gives 49 numbers. So, 49 times. So, 8's in units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. This occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since our book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. So, let's count each range. - 80-89: 10 numbers (80-89), so 10 times. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: 488 - 480 +1 = 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 times. Wait, but wait: 80-89 is 10 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189 is another 10, etc. So, up to 380-389, that's 4 ranges, each 10, so 40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 40 +9=49. So, 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8 in the hundreds place. This would be pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98 times. Wait, that can't be right because earlier, when I thought units was 48, but now I'm getting 49. Let me double-check. For units place, using the formula: number of 8's in units place up to n is floor((n + 1)/10). For n=488, floor((488 +1)/10)=floor(489/10)=48.9, which floors to 48. But when I listed it as 8,18,...,488, that's 49 numbers because 488 is the 49th term. So, perhaps the formula is ceiling(n/10) if the last digit is >=8. Alternatively, maybe it's better to calculate it as (n - (n % 10 +1)) /10 +1. Let me test that. For n=488: 488 - (8 +1) =488 -9=479. 479 /10=47.9, which is 47, then +1=48. Hmm, that gives 48, but when I count manually, it's 49. So, perhaps my manual count was wrong. Wait, let's see: starting at 8, each step of 10. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, that's correct. So, units place 8's:49. Similarly, for tens place, I had 49. So, total 8's:49+49=98. Wait, but earlier, when I thought units was 48, but now I'm getting 49. Let me confirm: from 8 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, yes, 49 times. So, 8's in units place:49. 8's in tens place:49. So, total 8's:98. Now, 4's were 187, as calculated earlier. So, the difference is 187 -98=89. Wait, but let me check again because I might have made a mistake in counting 4's. Let me recount the 4's: units, tens, hundreds. Units place: from 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many? (484 -4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Wait, no, 484 is the last number ending with 4 before 488. So, 4,14,...,484. That's (484 -4)/10 +1=48.4, so 48.4, which is 48 full steps, but since 484 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, but earlier I thought units place for 4's was 48. So, which is correct? Let me check: 4,14,24,...,484. The first term is 4, the last term is 484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place 4's:49. Then, tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 ranges, 5\u00d710=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's valid. So, 50 times. Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 488 -400 +1=89 numbers. So, 4's in hundreds place:89. So, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=49+50=99, 99+89=188. Wait, earlier I thought it was 187, but now it's 188. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me recount. Units place:49. Tens place:50. Hundreds place:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 4's:188. 8's:98. So, difference:188-98=90. Wait, but earlier I thought 4's were 187, but now it's 188. Let me check where I went wrong. When I first calculated 4's, I thought units place was 48, but now I see it's 49. So, that's an increase of 1, making total 4's 188 instead of 187. So, the difference would be 188-98=90. But let me double-check all counts again to be sure.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of 4's printed is \\boxed{90} more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we need to count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n### Counting the number of 4's:\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - The number of such terms is calculated as: \n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488 + 1}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 49\n     \\]\n   - So, 4 appears 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges.\n   - So, 4 appears \\(5 \\times 10 = 50\\) times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The 4 appears in numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - The number of such terms is:\n     \\[\n     488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n     \\]\n   - So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding these together, the total number of 4's is:\n\\[\n49 \\text{ (units)} + 50 \\text{ (tens)} + 89 \\text{ (hundreds)} = 188\n\\]\n\n### Counting the number of 8's:\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - The number of such terms is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488 + 1}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 49\n     \\]\n   - So, 8 appears 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, except the last range which contributes 9 numbers.\n   - So, 8 appears \\(4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49\\) times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The 8 does not appear in any page number since the book only has 488 pages.\n   - So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding these together, the total number of 8's is:\n\\[\n49 \\text{ (units)} + 49 \\text{ (tens)} + 0 \\text{ (hundreds)} = 98\n\\]\n\n### Calculating the difference:\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's printed is 98.

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, like 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. To find how many such numbers there are, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives me 48 full groups of 10, and then check if the 49th group (481-490) has a 4 in the units place. Since 484 is within the 480-489 range, that's the last one. So, 48 times in the units place. Wait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so actually, it's 48 full cycles and then 8 more numbers. So, the units digit 4 appears 48 times? Wait, no, maybe I should think differently. Let's see: from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? It's the same as how many numbers are there where the last digit is 4. So, starting at 4, every 10th number. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there? Let me calculate: The first term is 4, the last term is 484. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that seems right. So, 49 times in the units place. Hmm, maybe I was wrong earlier. So, 49 times for units digit 4. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. So, numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has a set of 10 where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-100: 40-49, that's 10 numbers. From 101-200: 140-149, another 10. From 201-300: 240-249, another 10. From 301-400: 340-349, another 10. From 401-488: 440-449, which is another 10, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, how many blocks is that? 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, let me check: 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is 10, 240-249 is 10, 340-349 is 10, and 440-449 is 10. So that's 5*10=50 times. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. So, numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers are there from 400-488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** How many times does 8 appear in the units place? From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 ends with 8, so that's included. So, how many such numbers? Let's see: The first term is 8, last term is 488. The common difference is 10. So, number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8. So, numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has a set of 10 where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-100: 80-89, that's 10 numbers. From 101-200: 180-189, another 10. From 201-300: 280-289, another 10. From 301-400: 380-389, another 10. From 401-488: 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, for the hundreds place 4, the tens digit 8 occurs only 9 times. So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can only be 1,2,3,4. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8 because 800 would be beyond 488. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in sequences like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. There are 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in numbers 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in sequences like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. There are 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488. Occurrences: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Let me see how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 4, and the last one before 488 is 484. To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can calculate the number of terms in this sequence. The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term a1 = 4, the common difference d = 10, and the last term an = 484. The formula for the nth term is an = a1 + (n-1)d. Plugging in the values: 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10 \u2192 484 - 4 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 480 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n = 49. So, 4 appears 49 times in the units place. Wait, but 484 is the last page, which is page 484. So, from 4 to 484, every 10 pages, 4 appears once in the units place. Let me check: 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so there are 48 full decades and then 4 in the 49th. So, yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. This happens in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, which is correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, let me check that addition: 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, last is 488. So, the sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Using the same arithmetic sequence formula: an = a1 + (n-1)d. Here, a1=8, d=10, an=488. So, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2192 488 -8= (n-1)*10 \u2192 480 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is a partial range because the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Let's break it down: - From 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. - From 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. - From 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. - From 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. - From 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488). So, the first four ranges each contribute 10, and the last contributes 9. So total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because the hundreds place for 4's contributes a lot. Let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's correct. Now, for the tens place of 8's, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct because 488 is the last page. So, 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, that part is correct. So, the total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. So, the difference is indeed 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me think again. When counting the tens place for 8's, I considered 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contributing 10, but in the last range, 480-488, it's only 9 numbers. So, 4 ranges of 10 and one range of 9, so 4*10 +9=49, which is correct. Similarly, for 4's in the tens place, I had 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 ranges, 5*10=50. That's correct. So, yes, 50 in tens place for 4's. So, total 4's: 49+50+89=188. 8's: 49+49=98. Difference: 188-98=90. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).

This gives 49 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, like 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. To find how many there are, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So that's 48 times. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're dealing with whole numbers, it's 48 full groups. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, for the tens place, the 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers, specifically from 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5 blocks would give 5*10=50 times. Wait, but the last block is 400-488, which is only 89 numbers, but since we're looking at the tens place, it's still 10 numbers from 400-409, 410-419, etc., up to 440-449. So, actually, the last block is complete up to 440-449, which is 5 blocks, each contributing 10. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding them all up for 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process for 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, which gives 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, which is 488, so does that add another 8 in the units place? Wait, 488 is the last page. So, 488 is included, so the units digit 8 appears in 8, 18, ..., 488. So, from 1 to 488, how many multiples of 10 plus 8? The last one is 488, which is 48*10 + 8 = 488. So, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is 49? Wait, no. Let me think again. The first occurrence is 8, which is the 8th number. Then every 10 numbers after that. So, the number of times is floor((488 - 8)/10) + 1. Let me compute that: (488 - 8) = 480, 480/10=48, so 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier when considering 4's. Let me check that again. For 4's in units place: 4,14,...,484. 484 is 48*10 + 4, so that's 48 times. But for 8's, 8,18,...,488. 488 is 48*10 + 8, so that's 49 times. So, 49 times in units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Each full block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, 5 blocks. Each full block (like 80-89) contributes 10 numbers. However, the last block is 480-488, which is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, for the tens place, the number of times 8 appears is 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. Wait, no, let me think again. The blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each of the first four blocks is 10 numbers, and the last block is 9 numbers (480-488). So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 times. Wait, but earlier I thought units place was 49, tens place was 49, so total 98. But wait, let me check again. For the tens place, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. So, 5 blocks, but the last block is only 9 numbers. So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10, so 4*10=40, and the last block contributes 9, so total 49. So, 49 in tens place. Units place was 49, so total 98. So, 98 times 8 appears. Wait, but earlier for 4's, I had 187. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, but that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: Units place: 48 times. Tens place: 50 times. Hundreds place: 89 times. Total: 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: Units place: 49 times. Tens place: 49 times. Hundreds place: 0 times. Total: 49+49=98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. So, 49 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the units place for 8's. Let me recount that. The units digit 8 appears in 8,18,28,...,488. So, the first one is 8, which is page 8. The last one is 488. How many terms are there in this sequence? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + 10(n-1) = 488. Let's solve for n: 10(n-1) = 480 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, 49 times. So, units place for 8's is 49. Similarly, for 4's in units place: 4,14,...,484. Let's check n: 4 + 10(n-1) = 484 => 10(n-1)=480 => n-1=48 => n=49. Wait, but 484 is 48*10 +4, which is 484. So, 484 is included, so n=49. But earlier I thought 4's in units place were 48. Hmm, that's a mistake. So, for 4's in units place, it's 49 times, not 48. So, I need to correct that. Let me go back. So, for 4's: Units place: 49 times. Tens place: 50 times. Hundreds place: 89 times. Total: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: Units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds place:0, total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but earlier I thought 4's in units place were 48, but now I see it's 49. So, that changes the total. Let me confirm this. For 4's in units place: starting at 4, each 10 numbers. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The last term is 484, which is 4 + 10*(n-1) =484. So, 10*(n-1)=480 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, 49 times. Similarly, for 8's in units place: 8,18,...,488. 488=8 +10*(n-1) => 10*(n-1)=480 => n=49. So, 49 times. So, I was wrong earlier when I thought 4's in units place were 48; it's actually 49. So, correcting that: 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)= 49+50=99, 99+89=188. 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check the tens place again for 4's. The tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these blocks is 10 numbers. From 0-99:40-49:10 numbers. 100-199:140-149:10. 200-299:240-249:10. 300-399:340-349:10. 400-488:440-449:10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. So, 50 in tens place. So, 4's:49+50+89=188. 8's:49+49=98. So, difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such occurrences (from 4 to 484).\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449). There are 5 such blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total for 4:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences (from 8 to 488).\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488). The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.\n   - **Total for 8:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:**\nThe digit 4 is printed 90 times more than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, there are 488 divided by 10, which is 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4. That's 48 times. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so actually, it's 48 full blocks (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490). Wait, but 488 is less than 490, so the last block is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in the units place, the number of 4's is 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, from 140-149, and so on. Let me figure out how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, every subsequent hundred will have another block: 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? So that's 5 blocks in total. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. Therefore, there are 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll check each digit position again. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Again, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me check how many such blocks there are. The first block is 80-89 (10 numbers), then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. So, that's 4 blocks. Each block contributes 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 8's in the tens place. Wait, but does 480-489 have an 8 in the tens place? Yes, 480-489 is part of the book, so that's another block. Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? So, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers. So, that's 9 8's in the tens place for that block. So, total tens place 8's would be 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, but wait, the last block is only 9 numbers, so it's 9 instead of 10. So, actually, 4 blocks: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Hmm, so I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount. From 80-89: 10 8's in tens place. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9. So, total is 10\u00d74 +9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, there are 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, there are 97 8's in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 97 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, +89=187. That seems right. For 8's: units 48, tens 49, hundreds 0. 48+49=97. 187-97=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 48 + 49 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. To find how many times this happens, I can divide 488 by 10 and take the integer part. 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, let me check the last group. The last number with a 4 in the units place is 484, which is within 488. So, that's 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. But wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's correct. So, 50 times for the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. Each number here has a hundreds digit of 4. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, the last number is 488, which is 8 in the units place, so that's included. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89 is one range, contributing 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. From 400-488: Hmm, does 480-489 fall within 488? Yes, up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, but wait, the tens digit is 8, so 480-489 would have 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 9 numbers. Wait, no, the tens digit is 8, so the numbers are 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's one more range but with only 9 numbers. So, how many full ranges of 10 are there? Let me count: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 full ranges with 10 each and one with 9. So, total in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, zero times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, 97 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: \u230a488 \u00f7 10\u230b = 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such ranges (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n   - Number of occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in page numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \u230a488 \u00f7 10\u230b = 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four ranges contributes 10 occurrences, and the last range contributes 9 (since 488 is the last page).\n   - Number of occurrences: (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, like 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. To find how many such numbers there are, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a number, it's 48 full groups of 10. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last group is 480-488. In the units place, 484 is the last number with a 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, there are 48 times the 4 appears in the units place (since 480/10 = 48). But wait, 480 is the 48th group, so the 48th 4 in the units place is at 480? Wait, no, because 480 is 480, so the units digit is 0. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). In each complete block, there's one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. Now, in the partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. So, total 4's in units place: 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers) From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers) From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers) From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers) Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, how many blocks? 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 x 10 = 50 times. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, total 4's in the tens place: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. That happens in numbers from 400 to 488. Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Again, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks. Each block contributes one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Now, the partial block is 481-488. The units digits here are 1-8, so 8 appears once in this partial block (at 488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count these blocks. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers) From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers) From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers) From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 has 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), but the tens digit is 8 here. So, how many numbers? From 480-488, the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). But wait, in the tens place, 480-488: the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, how many blocks? The first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, etc.) each contribute 10 numbers, so 4 x 10 = 40. Then, the last block (480-488) contributes 9 numbers. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 times. So, total 8's in the tens place: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times. Adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Checking 4's: units: 48, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 48 + 50 = 98, +89 = 187. That seems correct. Checking 8's: units: 49, tens: 49, hundreds: 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, so the difference is 89. Wait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. I said that from 480-488, the tens digit is 8, which is 9 numbers. But wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but in terms of the tens digit being 8, each of these numbers has 8 in the tens place. So, that's correct, 9 numbers. So, 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, etc.) and one block of 9 (480-488). So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. That seems correct. Similarly, for 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. So, the difference is indeed 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times from 1 to 480, and once in 484, totaling 48 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times from 1 to 480, and once in 488, totaling 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any page number up to 488.\n   - Total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one number ending with 4. So, how many such blocks are there? Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, that means there are 48 full blocks and then a partial block from 481 to 488. In each full block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial block, 481-488, the number 484 has a 4 in the units place, so that's one more. So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, no, actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full decades and then 8 extra numbers. So, in each full decade, one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, so 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one block, so 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is another 10, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is only 10 numbers, right? So, how many blocks? 5 blocks in total, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So that's 5 * 10 = 50. Wait, but let me check. From 1-99: 40-49: 10. 100-199: 140-149: 10. 200-299: 240-249: 10. 300-399: 340-349: 10. 400-488: 440-449: 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each with 10, so 50. But wait, 400-488: 440-449 is within that range, so yes, 10 numbers. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. That happens from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. So, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Similar to 4's, it's every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then in the last partial block (481-488), the number 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last block. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189: 10. From 200-299: 280-289: 10. From 300-399: 380-389: 10. From 400-488: 480-488: 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place, and the last block contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, yes, 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 full decades (1-480) contributing 48 occurrences, plus one more in 484, totaling 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10 occurrences.

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, like 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Let me calculate how many such numbers there are. The first number with 4 in the units place is 4, and the last is 484. The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term a1 = 4, the common difference d = 10, and the last term an = 484. The formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is an = a1 + (n-1)d. Plugging in the values: 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 4 from both sides: 480 = (n-1)*10. Divide both sides by 10: 48 = n - 1. So, n = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, but wait a second. The last page is 488, so 484 is the last number with a 4 in the units place before 488. So, yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers long, so each contributes 10 occurrences. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, wait. Let me check if 440-449 is within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, that's valid. So, 5 ranges, 10 each, so 50 times. Hmm, but wait, wait again. Let me think about the hundreds place. If the hundreds digit is 4, then the tens digit can be 4 as well, but I'm only considering the tens digit here. So, yes, 5 ranges, 10 each, so 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? That would be for numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers are there from 400-488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188? Hmm, but let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. Yes, that's correct. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Using the same arithmetic sequence formula: an = a1 + (n-1)d. Here, a1=8, d=10, an=488. So, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 8: 480 = (n-1)*10. Divide by 10: 48 = n - 1. So, n=49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, counting 8's in the tens place. The tens digit is 8 for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is valid, but 489 is beyond 488, so the last number is 488. So, each of these ranges is 10 numbers except possibly the last one. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: that's 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, total in the tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but wait, let me think again. 80-89: 10. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, total is 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences here. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's. Units place: 49, correct. Tens place: 50, correct. Hundreds place: 89, correct. Total 4's: 49+50+89=188. Now, 8's: units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me think again. Wait, in the tens place for 4's, I had 5 ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each contributes 10, so 5*10=50. Correct. For 8's in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. That's 5 ranges, but the last one is only 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Units place for 4's: 4,14,...,484. How many terms? From 4 to 484 with step 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Similarly for 8's in units place: 8,18,...,488. ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Hundreds place for 4's: 400-488. 488-400+1=89. Correct. So, yes, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but wait a second. Let me think about the hundreds place for 8's. Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can't be 8, so 0 there. So, that's correct. I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every set of 10 numbers has one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, that's 480/10 = 48 sets, each contributing one 4. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so from 481 to 488, that's 8 more numbers. In these, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So, total 4's in units place: 48. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. How many such sets are there? From 1 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, 4 appears in the tens place in the 40-49 range (10 times), then in 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), and 340-349 (another 10). That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40. Wait, but does 488 include any more? 480-489 would be the next set, but since we stop at 488, that's only up to 488. So, in the 480-488 range, the tens digit is 8, not 4. So, no additional 4's in the tens place beyond the 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, 40 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, actually, in the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book stops at 488, it's 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 times. So, total 4's: 48 (units) + 40 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 177. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. But wait, 488 is included, so the last set is 480-488, which includes 488. So, that's 48 times. Wait, no, actually, 488/10=48.8, so 48 full tens, each with one 8, so 48. But wait, 488 is the 48th set? Let me think again. The first 8 in units is at 8, then 18, 28,... up to 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers ending with 8? The first is 8, which is the 1st, then 18 (2nd), ..., 488 (49th). Wait, so that's 49 times? Because 488 is the 49th number ending with 8. Wait, let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. The difference between 488 and 8 is 480, so 480/10=48, so 48 intervals, which means 49 numbers. So, units place 8's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Let's see how many such sets are within 488. From 1 to 488, the tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since we stop at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers each, contributing 10 times each. The last one, 480-488, has 9 numbers. So, total 8's in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 0 times. So, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. For 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 times. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. And 480-488: 9 numbers. So, 4*10=40 plus 9=49. That seems correct. So, total 8's: 49+49=98. Now, the number of 4's was 177, and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 177-98=79. Wait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=48, tens=40, hundreds=89. 48+40=88, 88+89=177. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 177-98=79. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 79 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4.\n   - Total: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - There are 4 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), each contributing 10 times.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488.\n   - This range includes 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive).\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 + 40 + 89 = 177.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 49 numbers ending with 8 (8, 18, ..., 488).\n   - Total: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - There are 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 times, and the range 480-488 contributes 9 times.\n   - Total: (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers are in the 800s, so no 8's here.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's minus number of 8's: 177 - 98 = 79.\n\n$\\boxed{79}$"

    "text": " So, in 1-10, it's 4; in 11-20, it's 14; and so on. To find how many times 4 appears in the units place up to 488, I can calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are and then see if there's a partial group. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete groups and then 8 more numbers. Each complete group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is within this range, adding one more 4. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49 have 4 in the tens place, then 140-149, 240-249, etc. Let's see how many such groups there are up to 488. Each hundred has one group of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers), so 10 times. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. Now, from 400-488: the tens digit can be 4 in 440-449, which is another 10. So, that's 5 groups, each contributing 10 times, so 5*10 = 50. Wait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 groups, so 5*10=50. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so that's 89 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488? 488 / 10 = 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 is within this range, adding one more 8. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's calculate each hundred: From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers) = 10 times. From 100-199: 180-189 (10) = 10. From 200-299: 280-289 (10) = 10. From 300-399: 380-389 (10) = 10. From 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 480-488 contributes 9 times. So, total in tens place: 10 (from 0-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the Digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - Total groups of 10: 48 (from 1-480) + 1 (481-488) = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49).\n   - From 1-488, there are 5 such groups (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89 times.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188 times.**\n\n**Counting the Digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total groups of 10: 48 (from 1-480) + 1 (481-488) = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89).\n   - From 1-488, there are 4 full groups (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and an additional 9 times in 480-488.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers in 488 pages have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0 times.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98 times.**\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90.**\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every set of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one number ending with 4. So, I can calculate how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That's 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, which is 488. Let me check if 488 ends with an 8, so the units digit isn't 4. So, actually, the last set is 480-488, which doesn't include a number ending with 4. So, I think I was right with 48 times for the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, in 140-149, 240-249, etc. How many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see. The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, 140-149, that's another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many such blocks? From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, and since 488 is higher, that's fine. So, 50 times. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This would be for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 4's. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets. Each set contributes one 8. So, 48 times. But wait, the last set is 480-488, which includes 488, so that's an extra 8 in the units place. So, actually, 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, no. Wait, 488 is included, so in the units place, 488 has an 8, so yes, that's an extra. So, 48 complete sets, each giving one 8, and then the 488 gives another 8, making it 49. Wait, but 480-488 is the 49th set? Let me think. From 1-10: 8 is in 8. 11-20: 18. 21-30: 28. ... 481-490: 488 would be in this set, but 488 is the last page. So, 488 is the 49th occurrence of 8 in the units place. So, units place: 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 can appear in the tens place. This occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's see how many full blocks there are. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, how many 8's in the tens place? Each full block contributes 10 8's, and the last block contributes 9. So, 4 full blocks \u00d710 = 40, plus 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, total is 4\u00d710 +9=49. So, tens place: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8 can appear in the hundreds place. But since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. 8 in the hundreds place would be 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. Wait, that can't be right because earlier I had 187 4's and 98 8's, so the difference would be 89. But let me double-check my counting for 8's. Let me recount the units place: from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 \u00f710=48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, and then the 488 is an extra, so 49. That seems correct. For the tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4\u00d710 +9=49. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 4's:187, 8's:98. The difference is 187-98=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For the 4's in the hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. For the tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 4's, so 50. Units place:48 times. So, 50+48+89=187. For 8's: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. So, 98. So, 187-98=89. I think that's correct. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets of 10, contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - Total: 48\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - This range includes 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets of 10, contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - Additionally, 488 includes another 8.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks each contribute 10 occurrences, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's: 187\n- Number of 8's: 98\n- Difference: 187 - 98 = 89\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " So from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every set of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, I can calculate how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488 and then see if there's a partial set. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and a partial set of 8 numbers (481-488). Each complete set contributes one 4, so that's 48 times. Now, in the partial set, 481-488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484). So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, for each hundred, there's a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. That would be 4 times 10 = 40. But wait, I should check if the last partial hundred (80-88) has any 4's in the tens place. The last hundred is 400-488, but wait, no, actually, the hundreds are 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers each. That's 4 x 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 0-8, so 4 appears in the tens place from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10. Wait, but 400-488 is actually 89 numbers, so the tens digit goes up to 8. So, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 more. So total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me correct that. From 0-99, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10. Same for 200-299 (240-249) and 300-399 (340-349). That's 4 x 10 = 40. Now, in 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, so 40-49 in the tens place would be 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's 10 more, making it 40 + 10 = 50. So total 4's in tens place: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, total 4's in hundreds place: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. In the tens place, I had 50, and units place 49. So 89 + 50 + 49 = 188. Hmm, but let me think again. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. In the tens place, from 0-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see: 40-49: 10 numbers, then 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50. So that's correct. Units place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in 481-488, 484 is the only one, so 49. So total 4's: 89 + 50 + 49 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the partial set 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so 8 appears once (488). So total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, how many 8's? From 0-399: 4 sets of 10, so 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. So total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: units (49), tens (50), hundreds (89). Total 188. For 8's: units (49), tens (49), hundreds (0). Total 98. Difference: 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but let me think again. When counting the 4's in the hundreds place, it's from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, correct. For the tens place, 50, correct. Units place, 49, correct. So 188 seems right. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, so 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total sets of 10 in 488: 48 full sets (480 numbers) + 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n   - Each set contributes one 4: 48 \u00d7 1 = 48.\n   - In 481-488, 484 has a 4: +1.\n   - Total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers every 100 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149).\n   - Number of hundreds in 488: 4 full hundreds (0-399) + 1 partial hundred (400-488).\n   - Each full hundred contributes 10 4's: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - In 400-488, 440-449 contributes another 10 4's.\n   - Total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total sets of 10 in 488: 48 full sets + 8 extra numbers.\n   - Each set contributes one 8: 48 \u00d7 1 = 48.\n   - In 481-488, 488 has an 8: +1.\n   - Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers every 100 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189).\n   - Number of hundreds in 488: 4 full hundreds + 1 partial hundred.\n   - Each full hundred contributes 10 8's: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - In 400-488, 480-488 contributes 9 8's (480, 481, ..., 488).\n   - Total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is the number of such blocks. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, that means there are 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 4. But wait, 488 is not a multiple of 10, so the last block is 481-488, which doesn't add an extra 4 in the units place. So, units place 4's: 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, from 140-149, 240-249, etc. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, in the hundreds, each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) has a block where the tens digit is 4. So, from 40-49: 10 numbers. Then, 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. Now, 400-488: The tens digit here would be 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. Wait, but 488 is beyond 449, so that's still 10 numbers. So, that's 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does the 400-488 block include 440-449? Yes, because 440 is within 400-488. So, that's 5 blocks, so 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can also be 4. This happens from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let's do the same for 8's. I'll go through each digit position again. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Again, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8. So, units place 8's: 48. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count these blocks. First, 80-89: 10 numbers. Then, 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. Now, 480-488: The tens digit is 8 here, so that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, 488 is the last page, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks each contribute 10 8's in the tens place, and the last block contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, total 8's: 97. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 97 = 90. Wait, that can't be right because 187 - 97 is 90. But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's in the tens place. I thought there were 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That seems correct. For the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Units place: 48. So, 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct. Now for the 8's: units place is 48. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 48+49=97. So, 187 - 97 = 90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting the tens place, I might have miscounted. Let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 1 to 488, the tens digit is 8 in the following ranges: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the end). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, that's correct. So, the difference is 187 - 97 = 90. Wait, but I thought the answer might be different. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 is correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, that's correct. So, I think my calculation is correct, and the difference is 90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be 90, but sometimes when I do these problems, I might have missed something. Let me try another approach. Let me count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position again, but more carefully. **Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** For every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets. Each set contributes one 4, so 48 * 1 = 48.\n- **Tens place:** For every 100 numbers, 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). So, how many hundreds are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, that's 5 hundreds blocks. Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place, except the last one, 400-488. Wait, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, each of the 5 blocks contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** Same as 4's, 48 times.\n- **Tens place:** For every 100 numbers, 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89). From 1-488, how many such blocks are there? Let's see:\n  - 1-99: 80-89 (10 numbers)\n  - 100-199: 180-189 (10)\n  - 200-299: 280-289 (10)\n  - 300-399: 380-389 (10)\n  - 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the end)\nSo, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, totaling 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so 0.\nTotal 8's: 48 + 49 + 0 = 97.\n\nDifference: 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes when counting in ranges, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me check the tens place for 8's again. For 480-488, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place? The tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's correct. So, 4 blocks of 10 and one of 9, totaling 49. So, I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, the number of 4's exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 4 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total units place 4's: \\( \\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\rfloor = 48 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n   - There are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), each contributing 10 4's.\n   - Total tens place 4's: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in page numbers 400-488.\n   - Total hundreds place 4's: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total units place 8's: \\( \\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\rfloor = 48 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n   - There are 4 full blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 8's.\n   - The last block (400-488) contributes 9 8's (480-488).\n   - Total tens place 8's: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 48 + 49 + 0 = 97 \\).\n\n**Difference:**\n\\( 187 - 97 = 90 \\).\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, I can calculate how many such blocks there are. The total number of units digits is 488, so the number of complete blocks of 10 is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, it's 48 full blocks. Each block contributes one 4, so that's 48 fours. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last block is 481-490, but since the book ends at 488, I need to check if there's an extra 4 in the units place beyond the 48 blocks. From 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is within this range, which adds another 4. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let me figure out how many such blocks there are up to 488. The hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're dealing with page numbers starting at 1, the first block is 40-49 (which is in the 0 hundreds, but since page numbers start at 1, 40 is the 40th page). Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 would be pages 440 to 449, but since the book goes up to 488, 440-449 is a full block. So, how many blocks is that? Let's count: 40-49 (1 block), 140-149 (2), 240-249 (3), 340-349 (4), 440-449 (5). Each of these contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 50 fours from the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens from page 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my math again. Units place: 48 blocks \u00d7 1 = 48, plus one more in 484, so 49. Tens place: 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. Hundreds place: 89 numbers from 400-488, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, total blocks of 10 up to 488: 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is the last page, so in the last block (481-490), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included. So, the units place 8's are 48 (from 1-480) plus one more in 488, so 49. Wait, no, because each block of 10 contributes one 8, so from 1-480, that's 48 blocks, so 48 eights. Then, in 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which adds another 8. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8's in the tens place occur in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. So, how many such blocks? Let's see: 80-89 (1 block), 180-189 (2), 280-289 (3), 380-389 (4), 480-488 (5). Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place, but the last block (480-488) has only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), so how many eights in the tens place? The tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, so from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers. So, for the first four blocks, each contributes 10 eights, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. The last block contributes 9 eights. So total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me think again. The block 480-489 would have 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 for all these 9 numbers, so that's 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8's in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place for 8's, I thought the last block was 480-488, which has 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. But let me confirm: from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, so that's correct, 9 eights. So, 4 blocks \u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So, that's correct. Similarly, for 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 is correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. But wait, let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct. Similarly, for the tens place of 4's, I had 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block has 10 fours in the tens place, so 5\u00d710=50. Correct. Units place for 4's: 48 full blocks (1-480) with one 4 each, so 48, plus 484, which is in 481-488, so that's one more, totaling 49. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place, 48 full blocks (1-480) with one 8 each, so 48, plus 488, which is one more, so 49. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So, total 8's: 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a big difference. Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, I could calculate the total number of digits and see how many 4's and 8's there are. But that might be more complicated. Alternatively, I could use a formula for counting digits in each position. For example, for the units place, the number of times a digit d appears is (n / 10) + extra if the remainder is >= d. Similarly for tens and hundreds places. Let me try that approach for 4's and 8's. Let's start with 4's. **Units place for 4's:** Total pages = 488. Number of complete decades (blocks of 10) is 488 // 10 = 48. The remainder is 488 % 10 = 8. Since 8 >=4, we add 1 more. So, units place 4's: 48 +1 =49. **Tens place for 4's:** Now, for the tens place, we consider blocks of 100. The number of complete centuries is 488 // 100 =4. The remainder is 488 % 100 =88. Now, for each century, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times. So, for each complete century, the number of 4's in the tens place is 10. So, 4 complete centuries contribute 4\u00d710=40. Now, the remaining 88 pages (from 400-488) need to be considered. The tens digit in these pages ranges from 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). The tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times. So, total tens place 4's: 4\u00d710 +10=50. **Hundreds place for 4's:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488. The number of pages here is 89 (as calculated before). So, hundreds place 4's:89. Total 4's:49+50+89=188. Now, for 8's. **Units place for 8's:** Total pages=488. Number of complete decades:488//10=48. Remainder=8. Since 8>=8, we add 1 more. So, units place 8's:48+1=49. **Tens place for 8's:** Blocks of 100. Complete centuries:4. Each contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4\u00d710=40. Remaining pages:488-400+1=89 pages. The tens digit in these pages goes up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488 inclusive). So, in the remaining 89 pages, the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times. So, total tens place 8's:40+9=49. **Hundreds place for 8's:** As before, no pages have 8 in the hundreds place, so 0. Total 8's:49+49=98. So, difference is 188-98=90. Okay, so after using the formulaic approach, I still get the same result: 90 more 4's than 8's. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have exactly one 4 in the units place. So, total 4's in units place would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, so 48 times. Wait, but let me check. The last number with a 4 in the units place before 488 is 484, which is 484. So, from 4 to 484, how many numbers? That's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Oh, so actually, it's 49 times. Hmm, maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me think again. Each block of 10 numbers contributes exactly one 4 in the units place, so from 1 to 480, that's 480/10 = 48. Then, from 481 to 488, we have 484 as the next number with a 4 in the units place, so that's one more, making it 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place can have 4 as well. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in 1-99, 40-49 is one range, that's 10 numbers. Then in 100-199, 140-149 is another range, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many ranges? That's five ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. That would be from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, from 1 to 488, how many 8's in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but let's check the last one. The last number with 8 in units place is 488, so from 8 to 488, that's (488 - 8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. That would be 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers. Let's count how many such ranges fit into 488. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-489 would be the next range, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, does that count as a full range? No, because the tens digit is 8 only from 480-489, but we only go up to 488. So, in the hundreds place, 480-488 has 8 in the tens place for 9 numbers (480, 481,...,488). Wait, but in the tens place, the digit is 8 for all these numbers. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's see, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 times. Wait, but is 480-488 considered as 9 numbers? Let me check: 480 is the first, then 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times 8 in the tens place for that last partial range. So total tens place 8's: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 4 appears in 400-488, giving 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of 8's from 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 90 times more than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every set of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has one number ending with 4. So, the total number of such sets is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a set, we take the integer part, which is 48. However, wait, that's not quite right because the last set might not be complete. Let me think again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete tens in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. Plus, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 is included once (484). Therefore, total 4's in units place = 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. Each set of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, how many such sets are there in 488? The hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we start from page 1, the first set is 40-49, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many sets? From 0 to 4 in the hundreds place, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does the hundreds digit go up to 4? Yes, because 440-449 is within 488. So, that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (including both 400 and 488). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book ends at 488, it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's printed: 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. Plus, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 8 appears once (488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in sets like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of that set. So, how many such sets? The hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, 5 sets. Each set contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except the last one, which only goes up to 488, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480-488), so the tens digit is 8 for all of them, which is 9 times. Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 for all numbers from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers (480-488), each having 8 in the tens place. So, for the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributes 10 8's in the tens place. That's 4*10=40. Then, the last set (480-488) contributes 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488, plus one more in the last partial set (484), totaling 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 40-49) for each hundred. There are 5 such sets (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), contributing 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in all numbers from 400-488, totaling 89.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers.

So, the total number of 4's in the units place is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning there are 48 full groups of 10 and then 8 extra pages. So, in the 490th page, but since we only go up to 488, the last 4 in the units place is at 484. So, actually, it's 48 times. Wait, but let me check: from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is indeed 48, because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we stop at 488, the last occurrence is 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, there are 5 blocks, but wait, the last block only goes up to 488, so does it include 440-449? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, each of these blocks contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Therefore, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, let me confirm: 40-49 is one block, 140-149 is another, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks. Each has 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, let's add them up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's printed are 187. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so we take 48 full groups, meaning 48 occurrences. But wait, 488 is included, which ends with an 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me check: from 1-488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is given by (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which only goes up to 488. So, let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total is 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 +9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total 8's printed are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 187. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. Difference is 187-98=89.

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, in every set of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, I can divide 488 by 10 to find how many complete sets of 10 there are. 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives me 48 fours. But wait, in the last set, from 481 to 490, but since the book only goes up to 488, the 48th set would be 481-490, but we only go up to 488. So, actually, the 48th set would be 481-488, which is 8 numbers. But the units digit 4 would still appear once in 484. So, actually, I think my initial calculation of 48 is correct because even though the last set is incomplete, the units digit 4 still appears once in each set. So, 48 fours from the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place. The digit 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see. The blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 488 is beyond that, so do we have to consider anything else? No, because 440-449 is entirely within 488, so it's fine. So, 50 fours from the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The digit 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up all the fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Again, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. So, 48 eights. But wait, in the last set, 481-490, but we only go up to 488, so 488 is included. So, 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So, actually, it's 49 eights in the units place. Wait, let me check that again. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus one if the last number is in the 8th position of the last incomplete decade. Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, how many complete decades are there? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete decades (each contributing one 8) and then the last partial decade is 481-488, which includes 488. So, in the units place, 8 appears once in each of the 48 complete decades, and once in the last partial decade (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. So, let's count how many blocks there are. The blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one, which is only 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, each block contributes 10 eights, except the last one, which contributes 9 eights? Wait, no, because the tens digit is 8 for all numbers from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the last block. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The digit 8 can only appear in the hundreds place if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: number of 4's (187) - number of 8's (98) = 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For the 4's: units place: 48, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For the 8's: units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check the tens place for 8's again. The blocks are 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. Similarly, for the 4's in the hundreds place: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. So, the difference is indeed 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 48 occurrences (once every 10 numbers, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets).\n2. **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (blocks 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449, each contributing 10 fours).\n3. **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (pages 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 49 occurrences (48 complete sets plus one in 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (blocks 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488, contributing 10 each except the last which contributes 9).\n3. **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"
