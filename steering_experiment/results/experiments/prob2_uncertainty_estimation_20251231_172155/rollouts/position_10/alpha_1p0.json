    "text": " Let me think, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, like 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such numbers are there? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets of 10. But wait, does 488 include a 484? Yes, 484 is within 488, so that's the 48th occurrence. Wait, but actually, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so the number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So that's 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, which is 488. So, the last group is 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, does that affect the count? Hmm, maybe not because even though 488 is the last page, the units digit 4 occurs in 484, which is within 488. So, I think 48 is correct for the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, moving to the tens place. The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? Well, from 0 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in 0-99, we have 40-49: 10 numbers. Then in 100-199: 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249: 10. 300-399: 340-349: 10. 400-488: 440-449: 10, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's count the ranges: 40-49: 10, 140-149: 10, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, 440-449: 10. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. Wait, but does 440-449 fit within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. So, total number of 4's is units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups. Each group contributes one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so the last occurrence is 488, which is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, the count is 49? Wait, because 8 is the first, then 18, 28,...,488. So, let's see: The first number is 8 (which is 8\u00d71), then 18 (8\u00d72), ..., up to 488 (8\u00d761). Wait, 8\u00d761 is 488. So, how many terms are there? 61 terms? Wait, no, because 8\u00d71=8, 8\u00d72=16, but wait, no, stepping by 10 each time, so actually, the units digit 8 occurs once every 10 numbers, so the count should be floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 ends with 8, it's 49. Wait, let me check. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, 28,...,488. So, the sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? Let's see, the nth term is 8 + (n-1)\u00d710. We need the nth term \u2264488. So, 8 + (n-1)\u00d710 \u2264488 \u21d2 (n-1)\u00d710 \u2264480 \u21d2 n-1 \u226448 \u21d2 n\u226449. So, there are 49 numbers ending with 8. So, units place: 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count the ranges: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. So, the first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last range contributes 9. So, total in the tens place: 4\u00d710 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, total 8's:49+49=98. Now, the number of 4's was 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187-98=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's. Units place:48, tens:50, hundreds:89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, total 98. So, 187-98=89. Yes, that seems right. So, the answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 48 such occurrences (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups).\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges, totaling 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, and including 488).\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last range (480-488) contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. How many such numbers are there? Let's see. The last page is 488, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484. To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide 484 by 10 and take the integer part. 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, so there are 48 instances. But wait, does 484 count as the 49th? Let me check: from 4 to 484, that's 484 - 4 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 gives 49. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many full tens are there? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, the first 4 in the units place is at 4, which is in the first ten (1-10). So, from 1-488, the number of 4's in the units place would be 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does 484 count as the 48th? Let me think again: from 4 to 484, that's 484 - 4 = 480, which is 48 tens, so 48 times. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? This would be in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. The hundreds digit can be 0 (for 40-49), 1 (140-149), 2 (240-249), 3 (340-349), and 4 (440-449). So that's 5 ranges. Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how about the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? Let's see, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, the last 8 in the units place is 488, so from 8 to 488, how many? 488 - 8 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 gives 49. Wait, that's conflicting with the earlier thought. Let me think: from 1 to 488, the number of 8's in the units place is how many? Each ten has one 8 in the units place, so 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, meaning 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so 488 is the 49th occurrence. Hmm, so maybe it's 49 times. Wait, let me check with a smaller number. For example, from 1-18: 8,18, so 2 times. 18 \u00f710=1.8, so 1 full ten, but 2 times. So, the formula is floor((n + 1)/10). Wait, maybe I should calculate it as (488 + 1) // 10, which is 489 // 10 = 48.9, so 48 times? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think differently. The first 8 is at 8, then every 10 after that: 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms are there? It's an arithmetic sequence starting at 8, ending at 488, with a common difference of 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? This occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such ranges there are. The hundreds digit can be 0 (80-89), 1 (180-189), 2 (280-289), 3 (380-389). So that's 4 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 4 * 10 = 40 times. Wait, but does 380-389 go up to 488? Yes, because 389 is less than 488. So, 40 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit would be 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 times in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 40 + 0 = 89. Wait, that can't be right because earlier for 4's, the total was 187, and 8's are 89, so 187 - 89 = 98 more 4's. But let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: Units place: 48 times. Tens place: 50 times. Hundreds place: 89 times. Total: 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 = 187. For 8's: Units place: 49 times. Tens place: 40 times. Hundreds place: 0. Total: 49 + 40 = 89. So, the difference is 187 - 89 = 98. Therefore, there are 98 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me confirm the units place for 8. I thought it was 49 times, but earlier I was confused. Let me recount. From 1-488, the units digit 8 occurs at 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? Let's use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: n = ((last - first)/difference) + 1. Here, first term is 8, last term is 488, difference is 10. So, n = ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, yes, 49 times. So, 8's total is 49 + 40 = 89. 4's total is 187. So, 187 - 89 = 98. So, the answer should be 98 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (4, 14, 24, ..., 484):**\n   - Total: 48 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449):**\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place (400-488):**\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (8, 18, 28, ..., 488):**\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place (80-89, 180-189, ..., 380-389):**\n   - Total: 40 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Total: 0 occurrences (since the book ends at 488).\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 40 + 0 = 89.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 89 (8's) = 98.\n\n$\\boxed{98}$"

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. How many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, how many sets of 10 are there in 488? That's 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. So, 48 times 4 appears in the units place. Wait, but wait, 488 is the last page. Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the last full set is 480, which is 48 sets of 10. So, 48 times. But wait, does 488 itself have a 4 in the units place? No, it has an 8. So, the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is within the 480-489 range. So, 48 times is correct. But wait, let me make sure. Let me think: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Oh, so actually, it's 49 times. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but the number of terms ending with 4 is 49 because we start counting from 4, which is the first term. So, maybe 49 times. Let me confirm: from 1 to 488, the number of numbers ending with 4 is floor(488/10) + 1 if the last number is >= 4. Since 488/10 is 48.8, floor is 48, and 48*10 +4 = 484, which is less than 488, so the number of terms is 48 +1=49. So, 49 times in the units place for 4. 2. **Tens place:** Now, for the tens digit. The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but our book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within range, but 440-449 is part of the three-digit numbers. Let me count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each set of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. For example, 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488? Yes, so all 10 numbers in 440-449 are included. So, 50 times in the tens place for 4. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up the three places: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's are 188. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** Numbers ending with 8: 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, but the last term is 488, which ends with 8. So, the number of terms is 48 +1=49. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 terms. So, 49 times in units place. 2. **Tens place:** Tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is included. So, each set of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with tens digit 8, except maybe the last set. Let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers). So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, so 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 times in tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, 0 times in hundreds place. Now, adding up units (49) + tens (49) = 98 times. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the difference is number of 4's minus number of 8's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. How many such numbers are there? Since the last page is 488, the last 4 in the units place is 484. So, from 4 to 484, how many numbers are there? Well, the first 4 is at 4, then every 10 pages. So, the number of 4's in the units place would be the number of times 4 appears in each set of 10 pages. From 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then a partial set from 481 to 488, which includes 484. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, no, actually, each set of 10 has exactly one 4 in the units place, so for 488 pages, the number of 4's in the units place is (488 // 10) + 1 if the units digit is >=4. Wait, maybe a better way is to calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. The formula is floor((488 + 1)/10) * 1 for each occurrence. Wait, no, perhaps I should think of it as for each digit place, the number of times a digit appears is calculated as follows: For the units place, the number of 4's is the number of times 4 appears in the units position from 1 to 488. Since every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9, so in each 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, total number of 4's in units place is floor(488 / 10) * 1 + extra if the last partial set includes a 4. Let me compute it as:\n\nNumber of complete decades: 488 // 10 = 48 (since 48 * 10 = 480). Each contributes one 4, so 48 * 1 = 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484). So total 48 + 1 = 49 times 4 in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, let's count the number of times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 for numbers from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, 440-449 is included, but 480-489 isn't fully included because 488 is the last page. So, let's see:\n\nEach hundred has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 40-49: 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. Similarly, 140-149: another 10, and so on. How many hundreds are there? Up to 488, so hundreds are 0 (1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488). So, in each hundred except the last, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times. For the last hundred (400-488), the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but since 488 is less than 499, we have to check if 440-449 is fully included. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, how many sets? 0-3 hundreds: 4 sets (0,1,2,3) each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So that's 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So total in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but wait, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's another 10. So total 40 + 10 = 50. So 50 times 4 in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. So 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So 188 4's.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll go through each digit place: units, tens, hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place:** How many times does 8 appear in the units place from 1 to 488? Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, number of complete decades is 488 // 10 = 48, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (488). So total 48 + 1 = 49 times 8 in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? The tens digit is 8 for numbers from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n- 180-189: 10 times.\n- 280-289: 10 times.\n- 380-389: 10 times.\n- 480-488: Here, the tens digit is 8, and the units digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's 9 times.\n\nWait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 of these. So, for the tens place, the counts are:\n\n- 80-89: 10\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nSo total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Each hundred block contributes 10 times except possibly the last one. So, 4 hundreds (0,1,2,3) each contribute 10, and the 4th hundred (400-488) contributes 9 because 488 is the last page. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in the counting.\n\nFirst, for the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal:49+50+89=188\n\nFor the 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal:98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** 49 times.\n   - **Tens place:** 50 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 89 times.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** 49 times.\n   - **Tens place:** 49 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 0 times.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Let me see how many such numbers there are. Since the maximum page is 488, the last number with a 4 in the units place is 484. So, starting from 4, each 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, the number of 4's in the units place would be the number of times 4 appears in 1-488 in the units digit. Let me calculate how many full decades there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490). But wait, the last decade is 481-490, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last decade is incomplete. So, in each full decade, there is exactly one 4 in the units place. So, 48 full decades would give 48 occurrences. But wait, the 48th decade is 481-490, but the book only goes up to 488, so the 48th decade would have 8 numbers (481-488). Does that affect the count? Let me think. The 4 in the units place in the 48th decade would be at 484, which is within 481-488. So, that's one occurrence. So, total 48 occurrences from the units place. Wait, but let me check: from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, starting at 4. So, the count would be floor(488/10) = 48.8, so 48 times, but since 488 is the last page, and 484 is included, so 48 occurrences. So, 48 4's in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, in 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, in 140-149, and 240-249, and 340-349. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so let's see how many full hundreds there are. Each hundred block (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) contributes to the tens place. In each full hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). So, let's count how many full hundreds we have. From 1-99: 40-49 is one set, so 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. Now, from 400-488: the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, so 50 4's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. Let's see how many numbers that is. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's printed: 187.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll go through each digit position as well.\n\n1. **Units place:** How many 8's are there in the units digit from 1 to 488. Similar to the 4's, it's every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the count is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place.\n\nWait, let me verify: 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, how many 8's in the tens place. This occurs in decades like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488 (but since 480-488 is part of the 480-489 decade, but our book stops at 488). So, let's count how many full decades have 8 in the tens place.\n\nFrom 1-99: 80-89 is one set, 10 numbers.\n\nFrom 100-199: 180-189, another 10.\n\nFrom 200-299: 280-289, another 10.\n\nFrom 300-399: 380-389, another 10.\n\nFrom 400-488: 480-488. Now, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only for 9 numbers (480-488). So, total 8's in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 from 480-488. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how many 8's in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed: 98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's are printed than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49+49=98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nSo, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the number of 8's. \n\nTo solve this, we count the occurrences of the digit 4 and 8 in each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (every 10 numbers).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (10 in each of the five decades: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (pages 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (every 10 numbers, up to 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (10 in each of the four decades: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, plus 9 in 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences (no page numbers exceed 488).\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

Well, every 10 numbers, there's one such number. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last group is 480-488, which includes 484 as the 4 in the units place. So, that would be 48 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does 484 count? Yes, because 484 is less than 488. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. So, numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 occurrences. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449? Since the book has 488 pages, 449 is within the range, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. So, numbers from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's are 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, there's an 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. So, 48 times. But wait, the last group is 480-488, which includes 488, so does that count as an 8 in the units place? Yes, because 488 ends with an 8. So, that's 48 occurrences. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. So, numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers except the last one. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total for tens place: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. So, numbers from 800 to 899. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences here. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, total 8's are 97. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** Every 10 numbers, there's a 4.

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Wait, does 484 count? Since 484 is less than 488, yes. So, how many such numbers are there? Let's see, from 4 to 484, stepping by 10 each time. The number of terms would be ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that seems off because 4 to 484 is 480 apart, which divided by 10 gives 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, for the tens digit being 4. This occurs in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers, so that's 5 blocks. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5 blocks x 10 = 50. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, but the last number would be 488. So, starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms? Let's calculate ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 488 is included, so that's correct. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit being 8 occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's see how many numbers that is. From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) have 10 numbers each, so 4 blocks x 10 = 40. Then, the last block from 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up the 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, subtracting the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For the 4's: units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For the 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, maybe that's right. But let me think again. Wait, in the hundreds place for 4's, I counted from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. Each of those has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. For 8's, in the tens place, I considered 80-89, which is 10, then 180-189, another 10, 280-289, 10, 380-389, 10, and then 480-488, which is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. Units place for 8's: from 8,18,...,488. Let's see, 488 is included, so how many terms? The first term is 8, which is 8, then each step is 10. So, the nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. We want 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488. So, (n-1)*10 \u2264 480, so n-1 \u2264 48, so n \u2264 49. So, 49 terms. So, units place:49, correct. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 times\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 times\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 4 blocks \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 times\n- **Hundreds place:** None (since pages go up to 488)\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. How many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of times 4 is the last digit. Since every 10 numbers, 4 appears once, the total number of 4's in the units place would be the total number of decades (groups of 10) in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a decade, it's 48 full decades, giving 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place. But wait, in the 480-488 range, the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, 48 times seems correct because 488 is the 49th decade, but 488 is the last number, so 48 full decades. Wait, actually, 488 is the 49th decade starting from 0-9 as the first decade. Hmm, maybe I should think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488 is equal to the number of times 4 is the units digit. So, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, total number is floor(488/10) = 48 times, but wait, 488 is 48*10 + 8, so yes, 48 times. But wait, 484 is within the range, so 48 times is correct. So, 48 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, how about the tens digit? The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there? From 0-488, the tens digit is 4 in the decades 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, let me check the last range. 440-449 is within 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 5 ranges, 10 numbers each, 50 times. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, each of these numbers has the hundreds digit as 4, so that's 89 times. Wait, but the hundreds digit is only 4 in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. So, total 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? From 1 to 488, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is floor(488/10)=48 times, but let's check the last number. The last number ending with 8 before 488 is 488 itself, which is 488. So, 488 is included, so 48 times. So, 48 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, how many ranges? Let's see: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place being 8, we have 4 full decades (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40, and then 480-488 is 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total 40+9=49 times. Wait, but let me check: from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 in all these numbers, so that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, yes, 9 numbers. So, total 40+9=49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48+49=97. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's:187, total 8's:97. The difference is 187-97=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's: units:48, tens:50, hundreds:89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. Now for 8's: units:48, tens:49, hundreds:0. 48+49=97. So, 187-97=90. Hmm, but wait, when counting the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, but let me check: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place for that range. So, 4 full decades (80-89, etc.) give 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, total 49. That seems correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. Wait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct. So, yes, the total number of 4's is 187, and 8's is 97, so the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, taking the floor value).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens digit for 10 numbers in each of the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449, totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in the hundreds digit for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens digit for 10 numbers in each of the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, and 380-389, plus 9 numbers in 480-488, totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds digit since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **97**.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Let me figure out how many such numbers there are. The last page is 488, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484. To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives me 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, I take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48? Hmm, maybe I should check this differently. Let me think: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then 14, 24, ..., 484. The number of terms in this sequence can be found by (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Oh, so actually, there are 49 times 4 appears in the units place. I think I made a mistake earlier by just taking the integer part. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 40-49: that's one block. Then, 140-149: another, 240-249: another, 340-349: another, and 440-449: another. So that's 5 blocks. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, the last block is 440-449. Since the book goes up to 488, 449 is within the range, so all 5 blocks are valid. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how about the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. Let me see: from 400 to 488, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Numbers ending with 8 from 1 to 488. The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many terms there are. The last term is 488. The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms can be found by (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, numbers where the tens digit is 8. These are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488. Let's check each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total for tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, 8 in the hundreds place would be 800-899, but since the book only has 488 pages, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Let me see how many such numbers there are. Since the book ends at 488, the last page with a 4 in the units place is 484. To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide 484 by 10, which gives 48.4, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, it's 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so after 484, the next number is 485, which doesn't end with 4. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place, 4 can appear in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up the number of 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears in numbers ending with 8, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number ending with 8 before 488 is 488 itself. So, how many such numbers? Starting from 8, every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times. Wait, but let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. Now, 400-488: does 480-489 fall within 488? 480-489 would be up to 489, but the book ends at 488. So, 480-488 is part of this range. Wait, but does the tens digit being 8 include 480-489? Yes, but since the book stops at 488, we only have 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but in terms of the tens place, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, in the hundreds place 4, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? From 0-399, we have 4 ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, it's 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Wait, that's 98. Wait, but earlier I thought units was 49 and tens was 49, so total 98. But let me double-check the tens place because I might have made a mistake. In the tens place, from 0-399, we have four ranges: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49. So, yes, 49 in tens place. Units place: 49, tens place:49, hundreds:0, total 98. So, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187-98=89. Wait, that seems correct. But let me cross-verify. Alternatively, I can think of the number of 4's as follows: For each digit position, count how many times 4 appears. Units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, so 488/10=48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 in units place, so 48. Then, since 488 is the last number, and 488 mod 10 is 8, so the last 4 in units place is 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, units place:48. Tens place: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9, so in each hundred, 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. So, from 0-99:10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488: how many? From 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10. So, total tens place 4's: 5*10=50. Wait, but earlier I thought that in hundreds place, 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 5*10=50. So, units:48, tens:50, hundreds:89 (from 400-488). So, total 48+50+89=187. For 8's: units place: from 1-488, numbers ending with 8. The first is 8, last is 488. So, the number of such numbers is (488 -8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units:49. Tens place: as before, 49. Hundreds place:0. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, difference is 187-98=89. Wait, but earlier I thought the difference was 89. But wait, let me check the 4's again. Wait, when counting the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. So, total 4's:187, 8's:98, difference 89. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. The numbers are 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The number of terms can be calculated by (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. So, numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, total is 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. So, numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Numbers ending with 8 from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number is 488. So, the numbers are 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The first number is 8, last is 488. The difference is 488 - 8 = 480. Dividing by 10 gives 48, so number of terms is 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Numbers where the tens digit is 8. These would be 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of this. Let's count each range. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the end, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** None, as the book only goes up to 488.\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. How many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 48 times 10 is 480, so the last page is 488, which is beyond 480. So, from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, the 48th cycle ends at 480, and then we have 8 more numbers. So, in the units place, the number of 4's is 48. Hmm, wait, but 480 is page 480, so 480 has a 4 in the hundreds place as well. But for the units place, each cycle of 10 gives exactly one 4. So, 488 pages mean 48 full cycles of 10, so 48 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers long. How many such ranges are there? From 0-488, the tens digit is 4 in the following hundreds: 0-499, but our book stops at 488. So, the hundreds digits can be 0 (which is just 40-49), 1 (140-149), 2 (240-249), 3 (340-349), and 4 (440-449). But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 times 10 is 50. But wait, let me check: 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10. So that's 5 ranges, 10 each, totaling 50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This occurs from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total number of 4's is 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8. So, 48 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This happens in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each range is 10 numbers. How many such ranges are there? Let's see: 0-399, so 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 ranges, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 times 10 is 40. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. This would be from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units place (48) + tens place (40) + hundreds place (0) = 48 + 40 = 88. So, total number of 8's is 88. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 88 = 99. So, there are 99 more 4's printed than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't miss anything. For 4's: units: 48, tens:50, hundreds:89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units:48, tens:40, hundreds:0. 48+40=88. 187-88=99. Hmm, seems correct. But wait, let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place. And for the tens place, 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50 4's. Units place: 48 4's. So, 48+50+89=187. For 8's: units:48, tens:40, so 88. So, 187-88=99. Yeah, that seems right.

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. How many such numbers are there? Let me calculate. From 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place would be how many sets of 10 there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, I think it's 48 times. But wait, let me check. The last page is 488, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The 4 appears in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is before 488? Yes, so that's correct. So 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, looking at the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's calculate how many times. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 times. Wait, but 488 is included, so the last 8 in the units place is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because when I counted 4's, 484 was the last one, which is the 48th. But for 8's, 488 is the last one, which would be the 49th. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, let's count. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4\u00d710=40 and 9, so total 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract 98 from 187: 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. Correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the units place for 8's. Let me recount. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many terms? The nth term is 8 + 10(n-1). Let me set 8 + 10(n-1) \u2264 488. So, 10(n-1) \u2264 480, so n-1 \u2264 48, so n \u2264 49. So, 49 numbers. So, units place: 49. Tens place: as before, 49. So, total 98. So, 187-98=89.

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Let me figure out how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 4 and the last within 488 would be 484. To find how many, I can use the formula: ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = (480 / 10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 484 is the 49th term, but 488 is the total pages, so maybe I need to adjust. Wait, 484 is 484, which is 484 - 4 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range, so 49 times the digit 4 appears in the units place. Hmm, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is included. So, yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens digit. The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set would be 440-449, and then 480-488, but in 480-488, the tens digit is 8, not 4. So, how many full decades have 4 in the tens place? Let's see: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 occurrences, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. In numbers from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's there. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's. From 200-299, hundreds digit is 2, so no 4's. From 300-399, hundreds digit is 3, so no 4's. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4's appear 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. Using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count these. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers (since 480, 481, ..., 488 is 9 numbers). So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8's appear 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

Similarly, 140-149, another 10. Then 240-249, another 10, 340-349, another 10, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 sets of 10 numbers each. So, 5 x 10 = 50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Numbers ending with 8. These are 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so again, 48 full decades, but since 488 ends with 8, that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. So, the number of such numbers is (488 - 8)/10 + 1. That's (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit being 8. These occur in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count these. Each full range (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers. How many full ranges are there? From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. The last one is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 4 full ranges (each contributing 10 8's) and one partial range with 9 8's. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 48 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n3. **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n3. **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference = 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The number of terms in this sequence can be found by considering the difference between consecutive terms is 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1. Let me compute that: (480)/10 = 48, plus 1 is 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. So, numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 would be up to 449, which is within 488. Let me count how many such blocks there are. Each block has 10 numbers. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. That would be numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? Let's see, from 400 to 488 inclusive. The count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 occurrences of the digit 4. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Numbers ending with 8: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1. That's 480/10=48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Numbers where the tens digit is 8. These are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, let's count each block. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, total for tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 occurrences of the digit 8. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** Numbers ending with 4: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. How many such numbers are there? Let's see. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Well, every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so actually, the last number ending with 4 is 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens digit. The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, for each hundred, there's a 40-49 range. So, how many hundreds are there? 488 is less than 500, so there are 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), and then 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 includes 400-449 and 450-488. So, the tens digit is 4 in 400-449, which is 50 numbers (from 400 to 449 inclusive). But wait, actually, 400-449 is 50 numbers, but in the tens place, each 40-49 block is 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, 40-49 is 10 numbers. So, for 0-99, that's 10 numbers. For 100-199, another 10, and so on. So, how many hundreds? 488 is in the 400s, so up to 488, we have 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and part of the 400-488 range. So, in each of the first four hundreds, we have 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. That's 4*10=40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens digit 4's: 40 +10=50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 occurrences. So, total 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, we'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Numbers ending with 8 from 1 to 488. Every 10 numbers, so 488/10=48.8, so 48 times. Wait, but 488 ends with 8, so actually, 488 is the 49th occurrence. Let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? It's an arithmetic sequence starting at 8, ending at 488, with common difference 10. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Numbers where the tens digit is 8. These are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count each: - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189:10 - 280-289:10 - 380-389:10 - 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So total tens digit 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) -98 (8's)=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we'll count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (4, 14, 24, ..., 484):**\n   - There are 48 numbers ending with 4.\n\n2. **Tens place (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449):**\n   - Each hundred block (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) contributes 10 numbers.\n   - The 400-488 range contributes an additional 10 numbers (440-449).\n   - Total: 4*10 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place (400-488):**\n   - There are 89 numbers where the hundreds digit is 4.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (8, 18, 28, ..., 488):**\n   - There are 49 numbers ending with 8.\n\n2. **Tens place (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488):**\n   - Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers, except the last which contributes 9.\n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - There are no page numbers in the 800-899 range, so 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484. How many such numbers are there? Let me calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place. The first occurrence is at 4, and the last is at 484. So, the sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. To find the number of terms, I can use the formula for an arithmetic sequence. The first term a1 is 4, the last term an is 484, and the common difference d is 10. The formula for the nth term is an = a1 + (n-1)d. Plugging in the values: 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 4 from both sides: 480 = (n-1)*10. Divide by 10: 48 = n-1. So, n = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, but does 484 exist? Yes, because 488 is the last page. So, 484 is included. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's count the number of times 4 appears in the tens place. This would be in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 would be up to 449, but the book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included. Let me count how many sets of ten there are where the tens digit is 4. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 occurrences. So, 5*10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, let's look at the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400-488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But in each of these, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 occurrences. So, adding up the hundreds, tens, and units places: 89 (hundreds) + 50 (tens) + 49 (units) = 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again. 1. **Units place:** Counting how many times 8 appears in the units digit. The numbers would be 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is included. So, the sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me find how many terms there are. First term a1=8, last term an=488, common difference d=10. Using the nth term formula: an = a1 + (n-1)*d. So, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 8: 480 = (n-1)*10. Divide by 10: 48 = n-1. So, n=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, counting 8 in the tens place. This occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 exist? Yes, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 in 480-488 would be part of this. Let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me think again. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit would be 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Adding up the hundreds, tens, and units places: 0 (hundreds) + 49 (tens) + 49 (units) = 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484)\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449)\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488)\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = **188**\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488)\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488)\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Let me figure out how many such numbers there are. The first number with 4 in the units place is 4, and the last one before 488 would be 484. To find how many, I can subtract 4 from 484, which gives 480, and then divide by 10. So, 480 / 10 = 48. But wait, that gives 48 intervals, but since we include both endpoints, it's actually 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, no, actually, from 4 to 484, the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is the last one with a 4 in the units place. So, that seems correct.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens digit. The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 480-489 isn't, except up to 488. Wait, no, the tens digit being 4 is from 40-49, 140-149, etc. Let me count how many sets of 100 there are. From 1 to 488, we have four full hundreds: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and then 400-488. But for the tens digit being 4, each hundred has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's included. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, the total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Wait, let me check that again. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach.\n\n1. **Units place:** The units digit is 8 in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. The difference is 488 - 8 = 480. Divided by 10 gives 48 intervals, so 48 + 1 = 49 numbers. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, 480-489 would be the next set, but since the book ends at 488, we only go up to 488, so 480-488. Let me check each set. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, from 480 to 488 inclusive). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake with the ranges.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 4,14,...,484. The count is (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n- Tens: Each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4, and there are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, etc.), but wait, from 0-99, 40-49 is the first set, then 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct.\n- Hundreds: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89. Total 49+50+89=188. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 8,18,...,488. The last number is 488, so (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n- Tens: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4 +9=49. Correct.\n- Hundreds: 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, none. So, 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.  \n   - Each set contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such sets: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488.  \n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.  \n   - First four sets contribute 10 each, and the last set contributes 9: 10 \u00d7 4 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any page number up to 488.  \n   - 0 times.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Let me see how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is 4, and the last is 484. The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is an arithmetic sequence where each term increases by 10. The number of terms can be calculated by ((Last term - First term) / Common difference) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last one is 440-449. Let me count how many numbers in each of these ranges. Each range has 10 numbers, so from 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: 10, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. That's 5 ranges, so 5*10 = 50. Wait, but does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have a 4 in pages 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, there are 89 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, but each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many terms. The first term is 8, last term is 488. Common difference is 10. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, each range except the last one has 10 numbers. Let's count: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 ranges with 10 and 1 range with 9. So, total 4*10 +9 = 40 +9 =49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Let me see how many such numbers there are. The first 4 is at 4, and the last one before 488 is 484. To find how many, I can subtract 4 from 484, which gives 480, and then divide by 10 to get the number of steps: 480/10 = 48. Then, add 1 because both endpoints are included, so 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 484 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, for the tens digit being 4. These numbers would be 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, and so on. How many such ranges are there? Well, up to 440-449, which is the last one before 488. So, that's 5 ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). Each has 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit being 4. This would be from 400-488. How many numbers is that? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units: 4,14,...,484: that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. Tens: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5*10=50. Hundreds: 400-488: 89 numbers. So, 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many. The first is 8, last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in units place. 2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each range has 10 numbers. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 ranges, so 4*10=40. But wait, 488 is the last page. So, does 480-489 exist? Yes, but 480-489 is beyond 488, so the last range is 380-389. So, 4 ranges, 40 numbers. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit being 8. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. So, 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book stops at 488, so there are no page numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is 49 (units) +40 (tens) +0=89. Now, the difference is number of 4's minus number of 8's: 188 -89=99. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 40, hundreds 0: 49+40=89. So, 188-89=99. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me think again. When counting the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. For 8's, in the tens place, I have 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389: that's 4 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 40. Units place: 8,18,...,488: that's 49. So, 49+40=89. So, the difference is 188-89=99. So, there are 99 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check if I didn't overcount in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, that's correct. And in the tens place, for 4's, 40-49,140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 50. Units place: 49. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's, units:49, tens:40, hundreds:0. So, 89. So, 188-89=99. So, the answer should be 99 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 \u2192 40 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 40 = 89.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 89 (8's) = 99.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{99}"

    "text": " Let me think, from 1 to 488, how many times does the units digit cycle through 0-9. Well, for every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, the total number of 4's in the units place would be the number of complete decades (groups of 10) in 488, which is 48 full decades (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups). So, 48 times. But wait, does the last partial decade (88-488) have a 4 in the units place? Let me check: 488 is the last page, so the units digits go up to 8. So, in the 480-488 range, the units digits go from 0 to 8, which includes a 4 at 484. So, that's one more 4. So, total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49? Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, the number of 4's in the units place is the number of times 4 appears in the units digit from 1 to 488. For each ten, it's once, so from 1 to 480, there are 48 4's in the units place (since 480/10=48). Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1-8, which includes a 4 at 484. So, that's one more, making it 49. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is included. So yes, 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, how about the tens digit being 4? The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, for each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). Let me calculate how many full hundreds are there in 488. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). In each of these, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so that's 4*10=40 4's in the tens place. Now, what about the last partial hundred, 401-488? The tens digit in this range is 0-8. So, when the tens digit is 4, that's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 4's in the tens place. So total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 449 is included, so yes, 10 numbers. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 4's in the hundreds place. So, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** Counting 8's in the units digit. Similar to 4's, for every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many complete decades are there? 48 full decades (since 488/10=48.8). So, 48 8's in the units place from 1-480. Then, from 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included. So, that's one more 8, making it 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8's in the tens digit. The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see how many full hundreds we have in 488. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these has one set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so that's 4*10=40 8's in the tens place. Now, the last partial hundred is 401-488. The tens digit here goes up to 8 (as in 480-488), so when the tens digit is 8, that's 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. Wait, no, 480 is 480, which is 4 in the hundreds, 8 in the tens, 0 in the units. Then 481 is 481, up to 488. So, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So yes, 9 8's. So, 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8's in the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Checking 4's: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me make sure I didn't overcount any digits. Wait, when I calculated the tens place for 4's, I had 4 full hundreds (1-400) each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, the last partial hundred (401-488) has 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more, making 50. That's correct. For 8's in the tens place, from 1-400, each hundred has 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, 40+9=49. That's correct. Units place for both 4's and 8's: from 1-480, 48 occurrences each, then from 481-488, one more for 4 and one more for 8, making 49 each. So, that's correct. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - From 1 to 480, every 10 numbers contribute one 4, totaling 48 occurrences.\n   - From 481 to 488, the units digit 4 appears once (at 484).\n   - Total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each hundred (e.g., 1-100, 101-200, etc.) contributes 10 4's in the tens place, totaling 40 occurrences for the first 400 pages.\n   - From 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, contributing another 10 occurrences.\n   - Total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 pages.\n   - Total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - From 1 to 480, every 10 numbers contribute one 8, totaling 48 occurrences.\n   - From 481 to 488, the units digit 8 appears once (at 488).\n   - Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 8's in the tens place, totaling 40 occurrences for the first 400 pages.\n   - From 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, contributing 9 occurrences (since 488 is the last page).\n   - Total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8 (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Let me see how many such numbers there are. The first number is 4, and the last number with a 4 in the units place is 484. To find how many terms are in this sequence, I can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: (Last term - First term) / Common difference + 1. Here, the common difference is 10. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. This would be in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set would be 440-449, because 450-488 would have 4 in the hundreds place, but the tens place would be 5 or higher. Let me calculate how many full tens there are. Each set of ten numbers contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. From 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50. Wait, but let me check. From 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. Then 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. 200-299: 240-249 is another 10. 300-399: 340-349 is another 10. 400-488: 440-449 is another 10. So, that's 5 times 10, which is 50. But wait, when I look at 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 50 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. Let me see how many numbers that is. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears in the units place in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 ends with 8, so the last number is 488. So, how many terms are there? The first term is 8, last term is 488, common difference 10. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, 480-488 is part of this. So, each set from 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 how many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, the first four sets each contribute 10, and the last set contributes 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems like a big number. Let me check my calculations again because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me double-check the number of 4's: units place: 4,14,...,484. How many terms? From 4 to 484, step 10. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, and there are 5 sets (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). Wait, but in 400-488, the tens place 4 runs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 5 sets, each 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, 89. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488. How many terms? From 8 to 488, step 10. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189, etc., up to 480-488. Each of the first four sets (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399) has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, total 49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Because from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, that's correct. So, the difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me check again because sometimes when counting in different digit positions, especially when the number of digits changes, it's easy to make a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I can approach it differently by considering each digit position separately and ensuring I'm not double-counting or missing any numbers. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a formula for each digit position. Let me try that. For any digit position (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times a digit d appears can be calculated based on higher digits and lower digits. But maybe that's overcomplicating it. Alternatively, I can think of each position separately.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me recount. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 occurrences. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, the hundreds place doesn't contribute anything because the book only goes up to 488, so 800-899 isn't included. So, 0.\n\nWait, but when I think about the tens place for 8's, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the 8's in the tens place again. From 0-99: 80-89 \u219210 numbers. 100-199:180-189\u219210. 200-299:280-289\u219210. 300-399:380-389\u219210. 400-488:480-488\u21929. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, 4's: 188, 8's:98, difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I count 4's in the units place, I go up to 484, which is correct. Similarly, in the tens place, up to 440-449, which is within 488. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but wait a minute, when I count 4's in the hundreds place, it's from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, correct. So, 89.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, units place is 49, tens place is 49, so 98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, ..., 484. This is an arithmetic sequence with 49 terms.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each set contributes 10 terms, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 terms.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, ..., 488. This is an arithmetic sequence with 49 terms.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. Each of the first four sets contributes 10 terms, and the last set contributes 9, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Let me figure out how many such numbers there are. Since the book goes up to 488, the last number with a 4 in the units place is 484. So, starting from 4, each subsequent number is 10 apart. So, the sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. To find the number of terms, I can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d. Here, a_1=4, d=10, a_n=484. So, 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 4: 480 = (n-1)*10. Divide by 10: 48 = n-1. So, n=49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. Wait, but wait, 484 is the 49th term. Let me check: starting at 4, adding 10 each time, the number of terms is ((484 -4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Yeah, that's correct. So, 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. So, numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one block, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5*10=50 4's in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4. This would be numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, but wait, 488 is the last page. So, from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 188 4's. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The units digit is 8. So, numbers like 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. Using the same arithmetic sequence approach: a_1=8, d=10, a_n=488. So, 488=8 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 8: 480=(n-1)*10. Divide by 10: 48=n-1. So, n=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. So, numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 1-99: 80-89 is one block, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. So, in this case, the last block only has 9 numbers instead of 10. So, how many 8's in the tens place? Let's calculate: 4 blocks with 10 numbers each (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) and one block with 9 numbers (480-488). So, total 4*10 +9=49 8's in the tens place. Wait, but wait: 80-89 is 10 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place, so that's 10 8's. Similarly, each of the other blocks except the last one contributes 10 8's. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, total 4*10 +9=49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. So, numbers from 800-899. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "hit_max_tokens": false,
    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. How many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to how many full groups of 10 there are. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, it's 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. Wait, but 488 is 488, so the last group would be 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, in each group of 10, there's exactly one 4 in the units place, except maybe the last group if it doesn't complete. Wait, 488 is 48*10 + 8, so the last group is 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, does that mean the number of 4's in the units place is 48? Because each of the first 48 groups has a 4, and the 49th group (480-488) doesn't have a 484? Wait, no, 484 is within 480-488, so actually, the 49th group does include a 4 in the units place. Wait, no, 480-488 includes 484, which is the 48th 4 in the units place. So, maybe the count is 48. Let me check: from 1-488, how many numbers end with 4? They are 4,14,24,...,484. The first one is 4, the last is 484. The number of terms is given by ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Wait, so that would be 49 times. So, I think I was wrong earlier; it's 49 times. Because 484 is the 49th term. So, units place: 49 4's. 2. **Tens place:** Now, for the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, but 540-549 would be beyond. So, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: The first block is 40-49: that's 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many blocks is that? From 40-49 (40-49), 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 *10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 include 440 to 449, which is 10 numbers, yes. So, that's 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, for the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 +50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Numbers ending with 8 from 1-488. These are 8,18,28,...,488. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, but the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, but actually, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, but those numbers are 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but in terms of the tens place, 80-89 is 10 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so that's 9 8's in the tens place for that block. So, how many blocks? 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's:98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90.

So, how many such numbers are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 48*10 is 480, so the last number ending with 4 would be 484, which is within 488. So, that's 48 times. Wait, but starting from 4, the first occurrence is at 4, which is the 1st occurrence. So, actually, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48. Wait, no, wait: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full tens, each contributing a 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. So, numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many such sets there are. Each set has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, and so on. How many such sets are there? Let's see: starting from 40, each hundred has one such set. So, 40-49 is in the first hundred, 140-149 in the second, 240-249 in the third, 340-349 in the fourth, and 440-449 in the fifth hundred. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the fifth set would be 440-449, which is within 488. So, how many sets are there? 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5*10=50 times. But wait, let me confirm: from 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, so 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4. So, numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? Well, 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, numbers ending with 8: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing an 8 in the units place. So, 48 times. Wait, but 488 is included, so the last number is 488, which ends with 8, so yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Numbers where the tens digit is 8. These are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each set has 10 numbers. How many sets? Let's see: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. So, 4 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 380-389 is within 488, but 480-489 would be the next set, but since the book ends at 488, that set isn't complete. Wait, but 480-489 is beyond 488, so the last set would be 380-389. So, 4 sets, 40 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3, or 4. 8 in the hundreds place would be 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the 8's: units (48) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 88. So, total 8's: 88. Now, the difference is number of 4's minus number of 8's: 187 - 88 = 99. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units=48, tens=40, hundreds=0. 48+40=88. 187-88=99. Yes, that seems right. So, there are 99 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (4, 14, 24, ..., 484):**\n   - There are 48 occurrences (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups).\n\n2. **Tens place (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449):**\n   - Each set of 10 numbers contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - There are 5 such sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place (400-488):**\n   - From 400 to 488, there are 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (8, 18, 28, ..., 488):**\n   - There are 48 occurrences (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups).\n\n2. **Tens place (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389):**\n   - Each set of 10 numbers contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - There are 4 such sets.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 48 (units) + 40 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 88.\n\n**Difference:**\n- 187 (4's) - 88 (8's) = 99.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{99}"

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Let me figure out how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is 4, and the last one before 488 is 484. The difference between 4 and 484 is 480, and since each step is 10, the number of 4's in the units place is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 480/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 484 is the last page, which is 484. So from 4 to 484, stepping by 10, how many numbers? Let's see: (484 - 4)/10 = 480/10 = 48, so 48 + 1 = 49 times. So 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens digit. The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 540-549 isn't. Let's calculate how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 pages (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So from 1-400, how many such blocks? 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that's correct. So 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 page numbers. So total 4's in hundreds place: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, but let's check. The units digit is 8 in 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. Let's compute: (488 - 8)/10 = 480/10 = 48, so 48 + 1 = 49. So 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is included. Let's calculate: Each block of 100 pages (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So from 1-400, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place: 4 * 10 = 40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So total 8's in hundreds place: 0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For the 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Let me see how many such numbers there are. Since the book goes up to 488, the last number with a 4 in the units place is 484. To find how many 4's are in the units place, I can calculate how many numbers ending with 4 are there from 1 to 488. The first one is 4, and the last is 484. So, the sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term a1 = 4, the common difference d = 10, and the last term an = 484. The formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is an = a1 + (n - 1)d. Plugging in the values: 484 = 4 + (n - 1)*10. Subtracting 4 from both sides: 480 = (n - 1)*10. Dividing both sides by 10: 48 = n - 1. So, n = 49. That means there are 49 instances where the digit 4 appears in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is indeed the last one. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 for numbers from 40 to 49, 140 to 149, 240 to 249, 340 to 349, and 440 to 449. Let me check how many full sets of 100 there are in 488. Well, up to 400, so 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so all those 10 numbers are included. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, but looking for 8's. The numbers ending with 8 are 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the arithmetic sequence formula again: a1 = 8, d = 10, an = 488. So, 488 = 8 + (n - 1)*10. Subtract 8: 480 = (n - 1)*10. Divide by 10: 48 = n - 1. So, n = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, counting 8's in the tens place. The tens digit is 8 for numbers 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but the book goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let me check how many full ranges there are. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10. Then, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, total tens place 8's: 4 ranges with 10 each, which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, 40 + 9 = 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (4, 14, 24, ..., 484):**\n   - This forms an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 10.\n   - Number of terms = ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449):**\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers.\n   - There are 5 such ranges, so 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place (400-488):**\n   - Total numbers = 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (8, 18, 28, ..., 488):**\n   - This forms an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 10.\n   - Number of terms = ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488):**\n   - Each full range (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 numbers, totaling 40.\n   - The partial range 480-488 contributes 9 numbers.\n   - Total = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.**\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Well, every 10 numbers have one such number. So, the total number is the number of tens in 488, which is 48 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so we take the integer part 48), but wait, actually, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so the count is floor(488/10) = 48. But wait, 48*10 is 480, so 480 + 4 is 484, which is within the range, so 48 times. Wait, but 488 is included, but 488's units digit is 8, so it doesn't affect the count of 4's. So, 48 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. So, numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has exactly 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there? From 1-99: 40-49, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 10. 300-399: 340-349, 10. 400-488: 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. That would be from 400-488. Each number here has a hundreds digit of 4. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through each digit position again. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers have one number ending with 8. So, from 1 to 488, how many such numbers? floor(488/10) = 48. But wait, 488 ends with 8, so does that mean 48 or 49? Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's count how many: starting at 8, each step of 10. The last one is 488, which is 8*61 = 488. Wait, no, 8*61 is 488, but 8*60 is 480, so 480 + 8 is 488. So, how many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488. Let's solve for n: 8 + 10(n-1) \u2264 488 \u2192 10(n-1) \u2264 480 \u2192 n-1 \u2264 48 \u2192 n \u2264 49. So, 49 numbers. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8. So, numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count each block. From 1-99: 80-89, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers here? 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the last block contributes 9. So, total 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. That would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484)\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449)\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488)\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = **187**\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488)\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488)\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **89**\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Let me see how many such numbers there are. Since the book has 488 pages, the last page with a 4 in the units place is 484. To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide 484 by 10, which gives 48.4, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, it's 48 times. Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence because 4 + (48-1)*10 = 484. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range. So, 48 times in the units place for 4's. 2. **Tens place:** Now, for the tens place. The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's one set. Then 140-149: second set. 240-249: third. 340-349: fourth. 440-449: fifth. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 times. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, the book only goes up to 488. So, the last set is 440-449, which is within 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place for numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many times that is. The last occurrence is 488, which is in the units place. So, how many numbers are there? Well, starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds another 8. So, from 1 to 488, how many multiples of 10 are there? Wait, no, it's every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms can be found by (488 - 8)/10 + 1. So, (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place for 8's. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Each of these ranges (except the last one) is 10 numbers, but the last one is only 9 numbers (480-488). Let me count how many full sets there are. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. And then 480-488: 9 numbers. So, that's 4 full sets contributing 10 each, and 1 set contributing 9. So, total tens place 8's: (4 * 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times. So, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the Digit 4:**\n1. **Units Place:** 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. How many such numbers are there? Let's see, starting from 4, each subsequent number is 10 more. So, the first number is 4 and the last number in the 400s would be 484. To find how many terms there are, I can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: n = ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 fours in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. These numbers are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, and so on up to 440-449. So, that's 5 ranges (since 400-499 would be another, but since the book only goes up to 488, 440-449 is the last complete range). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's 5 ranges. Each has 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 count as a separate range? Yes, because 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. These are the numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The units digit is 8. These numbers are 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, it does. So, let's find how many such numbers there are. The first number is 8, the last is 488. The common difference is 10. So, using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. These numbers are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many ranges are there? From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers). So, let's calculate: 4 ranges of 10 numbers each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one range of 9 numbers (480-488). So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8 because 800 would be beyond 488. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as pages go up to 488 \u2192 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Let me see how many such numbers there are. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full cycles of 10, and then 8 extra numbers. Each cycle contributes one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), there's a 4 in 484, which is the 4th number in that partial cycle. So, that's one more 4. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, counting how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 for numbers from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last range 440-449 is okay because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400-488. Let me see how many numbers that is. 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Counting 8's in the units digit. Similar to 4's, it's every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8. Then, in the partial cycle 481-488, the units digit 8 is in 488. So, one more 8. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Counting 8's in the tens digit. This occurs in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count the ranges: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10. That's 4 ranges, each contributing 10 8's. So, 4 * 10 = 40. But wait, the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is fine, but what about 480-489? The book ends at 488, so 480-488 has 9 numbers. The tens digit here is 8, so from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers. So, that's an additional 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's here. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we'll count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - Every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - Total units place 4's: \\( \\frac{488}{10} = 48 \\) full cycles, with an extra 4 in 484.\n   - Total: \\( 48 + 1 = 49 \\) 4's.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the tens place for numbers 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 4's, and there are 5 such ranges.\n   - Total: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\) 4's.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n   - Total: 89 4's.\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once.\n   - Total units place 8's: \\( 48 + 1 = 49 \\) 8's.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges contribute 10 8's each, and the last range (480-488) contributes 9 8's.\n   - Total: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\) 8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0 8's.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**\n\\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such numbers are there? Let's see, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, the number of 4's in the units place would be the total number of tens in 488. That is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, it's 48 full tens, but wait, 488 is the last page, so from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times, each contributing one 4. Wait, actually, 488 is 48*10 + 8, so the number of 4's in the units place would be 48 times, but wait, when does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many terms are there? Let me calculate: The first term is 4, the last term is 484. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, so that's 49 times 4 appears in the units place. Hmm, maybe I was wrong earlier. So, from 1 to 488, the units digit 4 appears 49 times. Let me confirm: 4 appears in 4,14,24,...,484. 484 is the 49th term because 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484 => (n-1)*10 = 480 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. So, numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 would go up to 449, which is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many ranges? From 40-49: 1 range, 10 numbers. Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges in total, each with 10 numbers. So, 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 5 ranges, 50 numbers, so 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4. So, numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times the hundreds digit is 4. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me check if that's correct. Wait, 49 in units, 50 in tens, 89 in hundreds: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Okay, so 188 4's. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with 8. So, how many terms? The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The common difference is 10. So, number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8. So, numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many ranges? From 0-99: 80-89, 10 numbers. From 100-199:180-189, 10 numbers. From 200-299:280-289, 10 numbers. From 300-399:380-389, 10 numbers. From 400-488:480-488. So, how many numbers in 480-488? 488 - 480 +1=9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 8 appears in 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-488. So, for the first four ranges, each has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, the last range has 9 numbers. So, total 40+9=49 times 8 appears in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. So, numbers from 800-899. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0=98. Wait, but let me check again. Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0, so total 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, wait, did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me double-check the counts. For 4's: Units place:49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89, total 188. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0, total 98. Difference:188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers, correct. And for 8's, in the tens place, I had 4 full ranges (80-89, etc.) each giving 10, and the last one giving 9, so 4*10 +9=49. Units place:49, correct. So, yeah, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None (since the book ends at 488) \u2192 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Let me see how many such numbers there are. Since the book has 488 pages, the last page with a 4 in the units place is 484. To find how many 4's are in the units place, I can divide 484 by 10 and take the integer part. 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, so there are 48 occurrences. But wait, starting from 4, each 10 pages adds one more 4. So, from 1 to 488, the number of 4's in the units place is actually 48 because 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, which rounds down to 48. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. Let me check: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The next would be 494, which is beyond 488, so yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. So, numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, we have 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fit within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. So, numbers from 400-488. Let me find how many numbers are here. 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's, checking each digit position. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the units digit is 8. So, numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many such numbers there are. 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, meaning 48 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is included, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. So, numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such ranges are there? From 0-488, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Wait, but does 480-489 count? 480-489 would have the tens digit as 8, but since the book only goes up to 488, the range is 480-488. So, that's 9 numbers (480-488). Hmm, so I need to adjust for that. So, for the hundreds place, if the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can be 8, but the units digit goes up to 8. So, the numbers 480-488: that's 9 numbers, not 10. So, in the tens place, the first three ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 numbers, but the last one (480-488) has 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40, but wait, 4 ranges, but the last one only has 9. So, 3 ranges \u00d7 10 = 30, plus 9 = 39. Wait, no, actually, I think I miscounted. Let me clarify: 80-89: 10 numbers (80-89) 180-189: 10 280-289: 10 380-389: 10 480-488: 9 So, total is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but 480-488 is the fifth range, right? So, 4 full ranges (80-89, etc.) and then 480-488. So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. 8 in the hundreds place would be 800-899, but since the book only has 488 pages, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, there are 97 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (4, 14, 24, ..., 484):**\n   - There are 48 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449):**\n   - There are 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place (400-488):**\n   - There are 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (8, 18, 28, ..., 488):**\n   - There are 48 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488):**\n   - There are 4 full ranges (each with 10 numbers) and one partial range (480-488 with 9 numbers), totaling 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 48 + 49 + 0 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such numbers are there? From 1 to 488, the number of 4's in the units place would be how many times 4 appears every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, in the last group, 481-490, the 488 is included, so does 488 have a 4 in the units place? No, it's 488, which is 8 in the units place. So, actually, the last group up to 488 would be 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, does that mean there are 48 full groups (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490) but since we only go up to 488, the last group would have 8 numbers. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, how many 4's in the units place? Each group of 10 has one 4, so from 1-480, there are 480/10 = 48 times. Then, from 481-488, we have 484 as the only number with a 4 in the units place. So, total 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, no, because 484 is within 481-488, so that's one more. So, total 4's in units place: 48 (from 1-480) + 1 (484) = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 1-488, the ranges are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Wait, but the hundreds digit is only 4 in 400-488, so that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1-488, how many times? Let's see: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full times, and then in the 480-488 range, 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each has 10 numbers, so 5 ranges * 10 = 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1-488, how many times? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full times, and then in 481-488, 488 is the last number, which has an 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. So, how many numbers? From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and one range of 9, so 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. For 480-488, the tens digit is 8, right? So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9. So, the tens place contributions are 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. So, 89.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's 9. So, 49 in the tens place for 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier, for 4's, in the tens place, I had 5 ranges each of 10 numbers, so 50. Let me check that again. The ranges are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct.\n\nSo, 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly for the units place. For 4's in units place, from 1-488, how many 4's? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. Let's see, 484 is 48*10 +4, so 48 times, but then 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: 8,18,28,...,488. 488 is included, so that's 49 times. Correct.\n\nFor the tens place, 4's: 50, 8's:49.\n\nHundreds place: 4's:89, 8's:0.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, 8's:98. Difference:90.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of 10, contributing 48 '4's, plus one more in 484. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens place:** '4' appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range has 10 numbers, so 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** '4' appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups, plus one in 488. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens place:** '8' appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and 480-488 contributes 9. Total: 10\u00d74 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No '8's since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think, from 1 to 488, how many times does the units digit cycle through 0-9. Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full cycles of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each full cycle, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial cycle (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So total units place 4's: 48. 2. **Tens place:** Similarly, for the tens digit, each cycle of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full hundreds are there? Well, 488 is less than 500, so there are four full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Wait, actually, 400 is part of the fourth hundred, and then from 401-488 is the next part. So, in each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, four hundreds would have 4 x 10 = 40 times. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488, so the tens digit is 8 here. But wait, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times, except maybe the last one if it's cut short. Let me check: 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 numbers), 411-420: 1 (10), ..., 481-490: 8 (10). But 488 is before 490, so actually, from 481-488 is 8 numbers, not 10. So, does that affect the count? Wait, no, because when we're considering the tens digit, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except the last one, which is only 8 numbers. But wait, no, because each set of ten is 10 numbers. So 401-410 is 10 numbers, 411-420 is 10, ..., 481-490 would be 10, but since we only go up to 488, the last set is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, does that mean the tens digit 8 in 481-488 only appears 8 times? Wait, no, because the tens digit is 8 for all those numbers, but there are only 8 numbers (481-488). So, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears 8 times in the last partial hundred. But wait, I'm trying to count the digit 4 in the tens place, not 8. So, in the tens place, from 401-488, the digit 4 would be in the tens place for 440-449, right? Because the tens digit is 4. So that's 10 numbers, 440-449. So, in the 400s, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, in the 400s, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, in total, the tens digit 4 appears 4 times (from each hundred) plus 10 times in the 400s, but wait, no, because each hundred from 1-100, 101-200, etc., already includes the tens digit 4. So, from 1-400, the tens digit 4 appears 4 times 10, which is 40 times. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but that seems too high. Let me check again. From 1-100: tens digit 4 is in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, 101-200: 140-149, another 10. 201-300: 240-249, 10. 301-400: 340-349, 10. So that's 4 x 10 = 40. Then, 401-488: 440-449, which is 10. So, total tens digit 4's: 40 + 10 = 50. Okay, that seems correct. So, total tens place 4's: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. From 1-99, there's no hundreds digit, so 0. From 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's. From 200-299: hundreds digit 2, no 4's. From 300-399: hundreds digit 3, no 4's. From 400-488: hundreds digit is 4. So, how many numbers from 400-488? That's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. So, total hundreds place 4's: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's: 187.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, but let's check. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place. Each 10 numbers, 8 appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last partial cycle (481-488), the units digits go from 1-8, so 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-400, how many hundreds? 4. Each contributes 10, so 4 x 10 = 40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489. But since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, does 8 appear in the hundreds place? From 1-488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, total 4's: 187, total 8's: 98. Now, how many more 4's than 8's? 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units: 48 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, and the last partial ten doesn't have a 4 in units place)\n- Tens: From 1-400, 4 appears 10 times in each hundred, so 4 x 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, 440-449 is another 10, so 40 + 10 = 50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's in hundreds place.\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, and the last partial ten (481-488) has 488, so units digit 8 appears once more. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n- Tens: From 1-400, 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, from 401-488, tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. Total tens: 40 + 9 = 49.\n- Hundreds: 0, as 8 doesn't appear in hundreds place up to 488.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly for 4's? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct because each number from 400 to 488 starts with 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nFor the tens place, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 is only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nFor the units place, 48 times, correct.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 48 full tens, each with one 8, and the last partial ten has 488, so one more 8, total 49.\n\nTens place: 40 from 1-400, and 9 from 480-488, total 49.\n\nSo, yes, 187 - 98 = 89. So, the answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (once every 10 numbers, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 full tens).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (10 per hundred for 4 hundreds, plus 10 in 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488).\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = **187**.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (48 full tens + 1 in 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (10 per hundred for 4 hundreds + 9 in 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 187 - 98 = **89**.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, I think it's 48 full sets of 10 pages, each contributing one 4. But wait, 488 is the last page, which is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full tens and then 8 extra pages. So, the number of 4's in the units place would be 48. But wait, let me check: from 1 to 480, that's 48 sets of 10, so 48 4's. Then from 481 to 488, the next 4 in the units place would be 484, which is within this range. So, that's one more 4. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 4's in the units place. Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, and 484 is the 484th page, which is within the 481-488 range. So, yes, 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, for the tens place, 4 appears as the second digit. So, numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one block, that's 10 4's. From 100-199: 140-149 is another block, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within the range, but 540-549 would be beyond 488, so we don't have that. So, how many blocks? Let's see: 40-49 (1 block), 140-149 (2nd), 240-249 (3rd), 340-349 (4th), and 440-449 (5th). Each contributes 10 4's. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 fall entirely within 488? 449 is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4. So, numbers from 400-488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them all up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's printed: 188. Now, let's do the same for 8's. I'll go through each digit position again. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, similar to the 4's, how many 8's in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is included, so 488 is 488, which is an 8 in the units place. So, 48 full sets (1-480) give 48 8's, and then 488 adds one more, so 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears as the second digit in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 8's. Let's count the blocks: 80-89 (1), 180-189 (2), 280-289 (3), 380-389 (4). So, 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 8's in the tens place. Wait, but does 380-389 fall within 488? Yes, because 389 is less than 488. 4. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book stops at 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, total 8's printed: 89. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 89 = 99. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's: units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units:49, tens:40, hundreds:0. 49+40=89. So, 188-89=99. Hmm, but wait, when I counted the units place for 4's, I considered 488 as the last page, so 484 is included, giving 49 4's. Similarly, for 8's, 488 is included, so 488 is counted as an 8 in the units place. So, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the tens place for 4's. I had 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. That's correct. Similarly, for 8's in the tens place, I had 4 blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block is 10 numbers, so 4\u00d710=40. Correct. Hundreds place for 4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Correct. For 8's, hundreds place: none, correct. So, the difference is indeed 188 - 89 = 99. So, 99 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of 10, contributing 48 4's.\n   - Additionally, 484 is within the range, adding 1 more.\n   - **Total in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 4's, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - **Total in tens place:** 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - This range includes 89 numbers.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of 10, contributing 48 8's.\n   - Additionally, 488 is included, adding 1 more.\n   - **Total in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389.\n   - Each block contributes 10 8's, and there are 4 such blocks.\n   - **Total in tens place:** 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **89**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 89 (number of 8's) = **99**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{99}"

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Let me figure out how many such numbers there are. Since the book goes up to 488, the last page with a 4 in the units place is 484. So, starting from 4, every 10th page. How many terms are in this sequence? The first term is 4, the last term is 484. The common difference is 10. The formula for the number of terms is ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's look at the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449? Yes, and 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but let me check: 400 is the first, 401, ..., up to 488. So that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's are 188. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** Counting 8's in the units digit. The numbers are 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with 8. So, the sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many terms. The first term is 8, the last term is 488, common difference 10. Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8's in the tens place. These occur in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such ranges: From 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: Well, 480-489 would be the next, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8, so 480-489 would have the tens digit as 8, but 489 is beyond 488, so only up to 488. So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, in the 400-488 range, we have 9 numbers instead of 10. So, total tens place 8's: 4 ranges of 10 (from 0-399) and one range of 9 (from 400-488). So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8's in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can only be 8 if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (4, 14, 24, ..., 484):**\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens place (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449):**\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges.\n   - Total: 5 * 10 = 50\n\n3. **Hundreds place (400-488):**\n   - Numbers from 400 to 488: 89 numbers\n   - Total: 89\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (8, 18, 28, ..., 488):**\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens place (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488):**\n   - Four ranges of 10 and one range of 9 (480-488).\n   - Total: 4*10 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers in 800-899.\n   - Total: 0\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Let's see, from 1 to 488, how many times does the digit 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, like 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such numbers are there? Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does 484 count? Yes, because 484 is within 488. So, 48 times. But wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, the numbers ending with 4 are 4,14,24,...,484. How many are there? The formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last term - first term)/common difference) +1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Oh, so I was wrong earlier. It's 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, making it 49 times. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier by taking 488/10 as 48.8, but since we're dealing with numbers up to 488, it's better to calculate it as the number of times 4 appears in the units place. So, it's 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Let's see how many such groups there are. Each hundred has one group where the tens digit is 4, except maybe the last one if 488 is less than 499. So, from 1-99: 40-49: 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149: 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249: 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349: 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449: 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, each hundred contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many hundreds are there? From 1-400, that's four hundreds: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, no, 400-488 is part of the 400s, which is the fifth hundred. So, each of the first four hundreds (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) has 10 numbers with tens digit 4, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total for tens place is 40 +10=50. Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 50 in total. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers, so that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** How many times does 8 appear in the units place? Similar to 4, every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does 488 count? Yes, because it's page 488. So, how many such numbers? Using the same method as before: ((488 - 8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is the range. So, let's count: From 1-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189: 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289: 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389: 10 numbers. From 400-488: 480-488: let's see, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, 488 is included, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488-480+1=9. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 10 (from 1-99) +10 (100-199)+10 (200-299)+10 (300-399) +9 (400-488) = 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** How many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 times (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484)\n   - **Tens place:** 50 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449)\n   - **Hundreds place:** 89 times (pages 400-488)\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 times (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488)\n   - **Tens place:** 49 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488)\n   - **Hundreds place:** 0 times\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. How many such numbers are there? Let me think. The first number is 4, and the last number in the 400s would be 484. To find how many numbers there are, I can use the formula: ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 484 is the last page, so does that mean 484 is included? Let me check: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, each step is 10. So, yes, 49 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, counting the number of times 4 appears in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, let's see how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. Wait, but does the 440-449 range end at 449, which is before 488, so yes, it's included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8. So, ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, let me count each range: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, because 488-480+1=9). So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89: 10. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9. So, yes, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, ..., 484 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrence as the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
