Wait, that seems like a lot, but let me go through it again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Checking fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. Eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, I'm a bit unsure about the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, right? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. Yes, that's correct. And for the tens place in fours, we had 5 sets of 10, which is 50, that's correct. For the eights, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct.
