So, (484 -4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct.

When counting the hundreds place for fours, does 400-488 include 400? Yes, because 400 is the first page with 4 in the hundreds place, and it goes up to 488. So, 488-400+1=89. That's correct.

How many? Let's see, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 48 full groups, but since 484 is included, it's 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: Units place:8,18,...488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49 (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89 (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '4' appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, each number has '4' in the hundreds place, totaling 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '8' appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488), totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '8' appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488 (9 numbers), totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No numbers have '8' in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of '8's from the total number of '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
