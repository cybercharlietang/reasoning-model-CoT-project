    "text": " Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4. So that's correct. In the tens place, each hundred block has 10, and we have 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 5*10=50. In the units place, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear? Well, every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus the extra 4 in 484? Wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range. So, 48 full sets (1-480) would give 48 fours, and then 481-488 includes 484, which is another 4, so total 49. So yes, 49 in units place. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is included, so 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's the 49th occurrence. So units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be another set, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 includes 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481,...,488). Wait, but in the tens place, 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, etc. Let's see how many full sets we have. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. Then 480-488: how many? 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 is the last page. So in the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So that's 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488: the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, right? So from 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 numbers. So total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Number of blocks: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Total occurrences: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Number of full blocks (10 occurrences each): 4 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389).\n   - Partial block (480-488): 9 occurrences.\n   - Total occurrences: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:** \\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, but the hundreds digit is 4 in all of them, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. So total fours would be 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let me check if that's correct. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is indeed 188. Okay, moving on to counting the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 occurrences. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the tens place being 8, but it's only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488, so that's 9 numbers. So, for each hundred block, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, no eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Now, the question is how many more 4's are there than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big difference. Let me recount the fours and eights.\n\nFor fours:\n- Units: 4,14,...,484: that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49.\n- Tens: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\nTotal fours: 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor eights:\n- Units: 8,18,...,488: (488-8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49.\n- Tens: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49.\n- Hundreds: none, so 0.\nTotal eights: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, that seems correct. But let me think again: in the hundreds place, fours appear 89 times, which is a significant number. And in the tens place, fours have an extra set because 440-449 is within 488, whereas for eights, the last set is only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, the fours have more in the tens and hundreds places. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of '4's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 400-488. This range includes 89 numbers.\n\n   Total '4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of '8's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This sequence has 49 numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** None, as the book ends at 488.\n\n   Total '8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - More '4's than '8's = 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are \\boxed{90} more '4's printed than '8's."

    "text": " Wait, wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Wait, when I counted the units place, I thought it was 49, but maybe I made a mistake there. Let me recount the units place. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first 4 is at 4, then every 10 after that: 14, 24, ..., up to 484. The number of such numbers is floor((488 - 4)/10) + 1. So, (488 -4) is 484, divided by 10 is 48.4, so floor is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, yes, 49 fours in the units place. Tens place: 40-49: 10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10) +1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, 480-489. But the book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, how many sets? Each set is 10 numbers. Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 -480 +1 =9. So, the first four sets (80-89, etc.) each have 10, and the last set has 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check again. Wait, when I counted the tens place for 8's, I said 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So that's five sets, each contributing 10, except the last one which contributes 9. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49. That seems correct. Similarly, for 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. Let me check the units place for 4's again: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place for 4's: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each 10, so 50. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be different. Let me try another approach to verify. Alternatively, I can count the number of 4's and 8's separately in each digit position and sum them up. Let's do that for both digits. **Counting 4's:**\n\n- **Units place:** As before, 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 times.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n\n- **Units place:** 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 times.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, I think 90 is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set has 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four sets have 10 each, and the last set has 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any page number since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, which gives 48 numbers, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So, that's 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488.

So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no hundreds places with 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. So, number of fours is 188, number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units place: 4,14,...,484. That's from 4 to 484, step 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Total fours: 49+50+89=188. Correct. For eights: units place:8,18,...,488. That's from 8 to 488, step 10. Number of terms: ((488-8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, since 800+ is beyond 488. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, difference is 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check again. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct. So, yes, total fours:188, eights:98, difference:90.

    "text": " Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Wait, no, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So total fours are 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last one is 488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence.

So total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, so 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. Wait, but wait: in the tens place, I had 4 full sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So that's 4*10=40 plus 9=49. So total eights: 49 units +49 tens=98. So, number of fours is 188, number of eights is 98. The difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Let me check again. For fours in the hundreds place: numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89 fours. Units place: 4,14,...,484. That's 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. So total fours: 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers. So 4*10 +9=49. So total eights:49+49=98. So difference is 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences (from 0 to 484 inclusive).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block has 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Four full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) give 40 occurrences.\n   - The fifth block (480-488) gives 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Maybe I overcounted. Let me recount each position more carefully. Units place: From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, and then an extra 4 in 484. So that's 48 + 1 = 49 fours in the units place. Tens place: For each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). So how many hundreds are there? From 0 to 488, that's 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place, except the last one, which only contributes 10 because 440-449 is within 488. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Hundreds place: Only in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89 fours. So total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, and then an extra 8 in 488. So that's 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? From 0-488, that's 5 sets: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), not 10. So, the first four sets contribute 10 eights each, and the last set contributes 9 eights. So total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. So total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: Units: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the tens place for fours again. From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each 10, so 50 fours. That's correct. For eights in tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Units place for both is 49 each, which seems correct. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (including 484).\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in 10 numbers per hundred, totaling 50 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, totaling 89 times.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (including 488).\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in 10 numbers per hundred for the first four sets and 9 times in the last set (480-488), totaling 49 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No 8's as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.  \n$\\boxed{90}$"

So, total fours: 188.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many? The last occurrence is 488, which is 488/10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, meaning 49 numbers (including 8, 18, ..., 488). So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 488 is the last page, so 380-389 is within 488, but 480-489 is beyond 488, so only up to 488. So, let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. So that's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 40 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights here.\n\nAdding up the eights: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 89.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the units place. From 8, 18, ..., 488. How many terms? The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The nth term is 8 + 10(n-1). So, 8 +10(n-1) = 488. So, 10(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 terms, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. So, 4 sets, 10 each, 40 eights.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 + 40 = 89.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 89 eights = 99.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, earlier I thought units place for fours had 49, but when I calculated, I thought maybe 49, but let me confirm.\n\nWait, for units place fours: from 4,14,...,484. The last term is 484, which is 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So, 10(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, n=49. So, 49 fours in units place.\n\nTens place fours: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So, 5 sets, 10 each, 50 fours.\n\nHundreds place fours: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor eights:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,...,488: 49 eights.\n\nTens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10.

    "text": " Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. Let me count how many numbers that is. The formula is floor((488 - 4)/10) + 1. So, (488 -4)=484, 484/10=48.4, floor is 48, plus 1 is 49. So that's correct. Tens place: each hundred block has 10, and there are 5 hundred blocks where the tens digit is 4: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So how many 8's in the units place? Let's see: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The first is 8, last is 488. So, the number of terms is ((488 -8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-489 would be the next set, but since the book only goes up to 488, the tens digit 8 in 480-488 is present. So, let's see: each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers. Wait, no: 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers (480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488). So that's 9 numbers. So total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) and 9 in 480-488. So 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, so fours are 188 and eights are 98. So the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should check the tens place for fours and eights again. For fours in tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. For eights in tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So 4 full sets (80-89, etc.) and one partial set (480-488). Each full set is 10, so 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, total 49. Correct.

Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 40 eights. But wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. That's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so that's 9 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 400-488: the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) plus 9 in 480-488. So, 4*10=40 plus 9=49. Wait, but earlier I thought 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and then 480-488. So, that's 4 full sets (each 10) and one partial set (9 numbers). So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nSo, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89: 10 eights. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. Then, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place had 49 eights, and tens place had 49, so total 98 eights.\n\nNow, the number of fours was 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me confirm if I did the fours correctly. Units place: 4,14,...,484: that's 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So that's 5 sets, each 10, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488:89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. Yes, that's correct.\n\nEights: units place: 8,18,...,488: 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total eights:49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10th number, resulting in 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. This range includes 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n   \n   **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This results in 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n   \n   **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - **Difference:** Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, let me check that again. 49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99, plus 89 (hundreds) gives 188. Hmm, that seems a bit high, but maybe that's correct. Let me see: from 1-488, the hundreds place only starts at 400, so 89 numbers is correct. The tens place: each hundred has 10, and there are 4 full hundreds (1-400), but wait, no, actually, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, from 0-99, 10-19, etc., so 4 in the tens place occurs 10 times in each hundred. Since 488 is less than 500, we have 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 400-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, 10 times in the tens place, so 4*10=40, plus in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50. That seems right. Units place: in each ten numbers, 4 occurs once, so from 1-488, how many tens are there? 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus the last partial ten, which is 481-488. In 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so 484 is included, so that's one more 4 in the units place, making it 49. So, units place: 49, tens place:50, hundreds place:89. Total 4's: 49 + 50 +89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The last number is 488, so 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, plus the last number 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So units place:49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, each hundred has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. From 0-99:80-89:10, 100-199:180-189:10, 200-299:280-289:10, 300-399:380-389:10, and 400-488:480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 -480 +1=9. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, etc.) and then 9 from 480-488. So 4*10=40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0 eights. Now, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, so 49 +49=98. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Hmm, but wait, did I count correctly? Let me double-check. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. So, 188 -98=90. That seems correct. Wait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4 full sets of 10 and one set of 9, so 4*10=40 +9=49. That's correct. So, 49 in tens place for 8's. Units place: same as 4's, 49. So, 98 total 8's. So, 188 -98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place (1s place):** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences (from 4 to 484).\n   - **Tens Place (10s place):** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449). Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place (100s place):** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n   **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place (1s place):** The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences (from 8 to 488).\n   - **Tens Place (10s place):** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).

Similarly, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 count? But the book ends at 488, so 480-488.

So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. So, total eights are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, the difference between fours and eights is 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98.

    "text": " Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Wait, 4 in units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, which means 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times. That's correct. Tens place: each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, so for 400-488, that's 5 hundreds? Wait, no. Let me think again. From 1-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. Then 100-199: 140-149 is 10. 200-299: 240-249 is 10. 300-399: 340-349 is 10. 400-488: 440-449 is 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. That seems correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.

So, how many 8's in the units place? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of it. So, each hundred has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place.

So, 0 eights here.\n\nTotal eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check the tens place again. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, total eights are 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first is 8, the last is 488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers.

So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98. Wait, that seems correct? Let me check again. Units: 49, Tens:49, so total 98 eights.

Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Total fours:49+50+89=188. For eights: Units place:8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last one is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check. Wait, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. Then, in the tens place, we have 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Then, in the units place, every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...484. Let me count how many: from 4 to 484, step 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 fours in the units place. So total fours: 89 (hundreds) + 50 (tens) + 49 (units) = 188 fours. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, it's 488, so units digit is 8. So, how many such numbers? Starting from 8, each step of 10. The last one is 488. So, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets do we have? 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, so 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9 (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Wait, but let me double-check. Units place: 8,18,28,...,488: 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. So, total eights: 49 + 49 = 98. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? But let me think again. Wait, when counting the tens place for 8's, I included 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's correct. Similarly, for 4's in the hundreds place, it's 400-488: 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Then, in the tens place, 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. Units place: 49 fours. So, 89+50+49=188 fours. Eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again: is there any mistake in counting? For example, when counting the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, correct? Because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in hundreds place. Then, in the tens place, 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So, 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in tens place. Units place: every 10 numbers, starting at 4, so 4,14,...,484. That's 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. So, 49 fours. So, 89+50+49=188 fours. For 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, difference is 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when counting, it's easy to make a mistake in the last set. Let me check the units place for 4's: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The first term is 4, the last term is 484. The common difference is 10. So, number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Similarly, for 8's in units place: 8,18,...,488. ((488-8)/10)+1=(480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. For tens place of 4's: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So, 5 sets, 10 each, 50. Correct. For tens place of 8's: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 5 sets, first four have 10, last one has 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: no 8's, correct. Hundreds place for 4's: 400-488:89 numbers, correct. So, total fours:89+50+49=188. Eights:49+49=98. Difference:188-98=90. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, totaling 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers except the last, which contributes 9 (480-488).\n   - Total: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Wait, let me double-check that. Wait, 49 (units) + 50 (tens) is 99, plus 89 (hundreds) is 188. Hmm, that seems correct. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Wait, so 49 +49 is 98. So, number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract 98 from 188: 188 -98 =90.

    "text": " Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 4 appears every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many times? The formula is floor(488/10) + 1 if the last digit is 4. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, and since 488 ends with 8, the last 4 in units place is at 484, which is 48 times 10 plus 4, so 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place: 49 fours. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. From 1-488, there are 4 hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. Wait, actually, 400-488 is part of the 400s, so that's 5 sets of 100 (including the 400-488). Wait, no, 400-488 is only 89 numbers, not a full hundred. So, in the tens place, each hundred has 10 fours, so for 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 4 sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349) each with 10, so 4*10=40, plus 440-449:10, so total 50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, but since 488 is included, the last 8 in units place is at 488. So, starting at 8, each 10 numbers: 8,18,...,488. So, that's 49 numbers. Wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 8: 8 = 1*8, 18=2*8, ..., 488=49*10 - 2? Wait, no, perhaps a better way: the number of times 8 appears in units place is floor((488 + 1)/10). Wait, let me think. The first 8 is at 8, then 18, 28,...,488. The total count is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each full hundred (e.g., 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 from 480-488. So, 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the number of fours is 188 and eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89, total=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0, total=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for eights. Let me recount the tens place eights. Each hundred has 10 eights in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, up to 400-488, how many full hundreds are there? 400-488 is part of the 400s, so the tens place eights in the 400s would be 480-489, but since we only go to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 adds 9 more, so 40+9=49. So, that's correct. So, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, fours:188, eights:98, difference=90. Wait, but I'm thinking, does 488 count as an 8 in the units place? Yes, because 488 ends with 8, so it's included in the units place count. Similarly, in the tens place, 480-488 includes 488, so that's correct. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first thought about it, I thought maybe 90, but I want to make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me try another approach: for each digit position, count the number of 4's and 8's separately. Units place: For 4's, as before, 49; for 8's, 49. Tens place: 4's:50, 8's:49. Hundreds place:4's:89, 8's:0. So, 4's total:49+50+89=188. 8's total:49+49+0=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. In the tens place, each hundred block contributes 10 fours, and there are 5 such blocks (0-499), but since we're only going up to 488, does that affect the count? Wait, 40-49: yes, 140-149: yes, 240-249: yes, 340-349: yes, 440-449: yes. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50 fours in the tens place. Units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1 four, so 48 fours, but wait, 488 is included, so 488 has an 8 in the units place, but 484 is the last 4 in the units place. So, how many fours in the units place? Let me think: The first is 4, then 14, 24, ..., 484. So, from 4 to 484, how many numbers? The difference between 484 and 4 is 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 gives 49 fours in the units place. So, units place: 49, tens place:50, hundreds place:89. Total fours: 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. Now, let's check the 8's. Similarly, I'll count the number of 8's in each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so the last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that right? Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check the counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This totals 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No pages have 8 in the hundreds place.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. Hmm, but let me double-check because I think I might have made a mistake. For the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. For the tens place, each hundred block has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, so for 400-488, how many such blocks are there? Well, 400-499 would be 10 blocks of 10, but since we only go up to 488, the last block is incomplete. Wait, no, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in 1-488, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? Let's see: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. That seems correct. And in the units place, from 1-488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 times. So units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total fours:49+50+89=188. Now, let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcounting. Let me think again. Each position is counted separately, so the total number of 4's should be the sum of 4's in units, tens, and hundreds. So 49+50+89=188. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is the 49th multiple (since 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers). So units place:49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many full sets we have. Each set (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So total tens place eights:4*10 +9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So hundreds place eights:0.\n\nSo total eights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check the tens place again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4*10=40 +9=49. So yes, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total eights:49+49=98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the hundreds place for 4's was 89, but when I added 49+50+89, I got 188. Let me make sure that's correct.\n\nWait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct. So 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nAnd for the tens place, 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours.\n\nUnits place:49 fours.\n\nSo total fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nEights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total eights:98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When counting the tens place for 4's, I included 440-449, which is correct because 449 is less than 488. So that's fine. Similarly, for the tens place of 8's, 480-488 is correct.\n\nWait, another thing: in the units place, 488 is included, so that's correct.\n\nSo, I think the calculation is correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).

The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Let me check again. The tens place: Each hundred block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, from 1-400, there are four blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10. So total tens place fours would be 40 +10=50. That seems correct. So, 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many such numbers are there? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The first is 8, then 18, ..., up to 488. Let me calculate how many terms. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264488. Let me solve for n: 8 +10(n-1) \u2264488 \u219210(n-1) \u2264480 \u2192n-1 \u226448 \u2192n \u226449. So, there are 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is within 488, so let's count each block. From 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, actually, from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (since 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9). So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, etc.) and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Wait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, total tens eights: 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4*10=40 plus 9=49. So total eights:49+49=98. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. The difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but earlier I thought fours were 188 and eights 98, so 90 more fours. Hmm, but let me check again because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me recount the fours:\n\nUnits place: From 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The sequence is 4,14,...,484. The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10 \u2264484. So, 4 +10(n-1)=484 \u219210(n-1)=480 \u2192n-1=48 \u2192n=49. So, 49 fours in units.\n\nTens place: Each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) has 10 fours in the tens place (40-49, etc.), so 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40+10=50 fours in tens.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nNow, eights:\n\nUnits place:8,18,...,488. How many terms? 8 +10(n-1)=488 \u219210(n-1)=480 \u2192n-1=48 \u2192n=49. So, 49 eights.\n\nTens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers. Wait, 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place for fours, 40-49,140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours.\n\nSo, the total fours are indeed 188, and eights are 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 188-98=90, but let me confirm: 188 minus 98 is 90. Yes.\n\nSo, the number of fours printed is 90 more than the number of eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book is 188, while the digit 8 appears 98 times.

So total fours would be 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let me check if I counted correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can use a formula. The number of times a digit d appears in each position up to N can be calculated using a formula, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should recount. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as: For units place, every 10 numbers, there's one 4. So up to 488, how many times does 4 appear in units place? The last occurrence is 484, which is the 49th occurrence, as 484 / 10 = 48.4, so 49 times. That seems correct. For tens place, every 100 numbers, there's 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So up to 488, how many hundreds are there? 400-488 is 89 numbers, but the tens digit cycles every 100. So, 400-488 includes 400-488, which is 89 numbers. But the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in each 100 numbers, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, in 400-499, that's 10 numbers (400-409, 410-419, etc.), but we only go up to 488, so how does that affect? Wait, from 400-488, the tens digit cycles 0-9 for each hundred. So, in 400-488, how many full tens cycles are there? Let's see: 400-409: tens digit 0, 410-419: tens 1, ..., 440-449: tens 4, 450-459: tens 5, etc., up to 480-488: tens 8. So, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, in the tens place, from 400-488, there's 10 fours. But earlier, I thought there were 5 sets of 10, but that might not be correct because the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488. Wait, maybe I confused the hundreds and tens digits earlier. Let me clarify: The tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 sets of 10 numbers each, giving 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. Then, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 49 times. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many sets of 10 there are. Each 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10). So, total eights in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90 more fours.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but when I was counting the tens place for fours, I considered 440-449 as part of the tens digit being 4, which is correct because in 440-449, the tens digit is 4, and the hundreds digit is 4 as well. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, which is correct because 480, 481, ..., 488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) plus 9 gives 49.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.

Wait, but 400-488 is part of the 400s, so that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 5\u00d710=50. Units place: From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full sets, each contributing 1 four, so 48\u00d71=48, plus one more in 484, making it 49. So total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48\u00d71=48, plus one more in 488, so 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each hundred has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except the last one, which is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, let me check: 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers. So, how many full hundreds? From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers), 100-199:180-189 (10), 200-299:280-289 (10), 300-399:380-389 (10), and 400-488:480-488 (9). So that's 4 full sets of 10, and one set of 9. So total tens place eights: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. So, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let me recount the fours. Units place: 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus one more in 484, so 49. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in tens place, so 40-49,140-149, etc. From 0-488, how many hundreds? 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So that's 5 hundreds. Each contributes 10 fours in the tens place, except maybe the last one? Wait, 400-488: the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So yes, 5\u00d710=50 fours in tens place. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, eights: units place: same as fours, 49 eights. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets is 10 numbers, the last set is 9 numbers (480-488). So 4\u00d710 +9=49 eights in tens place. Hundreds place: 0. So total eights:49+49=98. Difference:188-98=90.

    "text": " Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Wait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. In the tens place, each hundred has 10, so for 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, and in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, which are 4 sets of 10 each, so 4*10=40, plus the 10 in 440-449, making it 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, tens place is 50. Units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, which would be 48*1=48, but wait, 488 is included, so 488 has an 8 in the units place, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is 484. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 fours in the units place. So, total fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99+89=188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, which would be 48 numbers, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Let me count each block. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except possibly the last one if it doesn't go up to 89. So, from 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488:9 numbers. So, total tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the 4's. Units place: 49, tens place:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.

    "text": " Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check. Wait, in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4. So that's correct. The tens place: 10 per hundred, and there are 4 hundreds (1-400, 401-800, but wait, the book only goes to 488, so up to 400-488. So, how many hundreds? Let's see, 40-49 is in the first hundred, 140-149 in the second, 240-249 in the third, 340-349 in the fourth, and 440-449 in the fifth. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 5*10=50. That seems correct. Units place: every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 49 times? Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, does that add one more? Let me list them: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, (n-1)*10 = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So yes, 49 fours in the units place. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The last number is 488, which is 8 in the units place. So, 488 /10 = 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many sets? 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, as 488 - 480 +1 =9). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, no, because 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but I thought earlier I might have made a mistake. Let me double-check the counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for eights. Let me recount. From 80-89:10 eights in tens place. 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. Similarly, for fours in the tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10, so 5*10=50. And hundreds place for fours is 400-488:89. Units for fours:49. So, 49+50+89=188. Units for eights:49, tens:49, so 98. So, 188-98=90.

In the tens place, each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens, so 4 sets (since 400-499 would be 5 sets, but we're only going up to 488, so maybe it's 4 sets? Wait, no, from 0-400, we have 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers. So 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. So that's correct. Units place: 49 fours. So total fours: 89 (hundreds) + 50 (tens) + 49 (units) = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me see how many there are. The last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 count? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488. Here, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, how many sets do we have? The first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights in the tens place. Then, the last block (480-488) contributes 9 eights. So total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, but is that correct? Let me think again. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So that's 4*10 +9=49. So tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Wait, but earlier I thought units place had 49 eights, and tens place had 49, so total 98. But wait, let me check units place again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? The first occurrence is 8, then 18, 28,..., up to 488. To find how many, we can calculate (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So yes, 49 eights in units place. So total eights: 49 +49=98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: hundreds place: 89, tens:50, units:49. 89+50=139, +49=188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, so 98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for eights. Let me recount the tens place for eights. The tens digit is 8 in the following ranges: 80-89:10 numbers. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9 numbers. So that's 4*10 +9=49. So that's correct. So total eights:49+49=98.

So total fours would be 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but the last occurrence is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last set. Each full block (like 80-89) has 10 eights in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-400, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights, so 40 eights. Now, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, but wait: 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488. So, 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, 4 blocks * 10 = 40, plus 9, total 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, but let me make sure. Units place: 8,18,28,...,488. That's 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total eights: 49 + 49 = 98. So, number of fours is 188, number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check. Wait, in the hundreds place for fours, I had 89 numbers from 400-488, each contributing a 4. So, 89 fours there. Units place: 49 fours. Tens place: 50 fours. So, 89+49=138, plus 50 is 188. For eights, units:49, tens:49, so 98. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check. Wait, when I counted the units place, I thought it was 49, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me recount the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many terms are there? The first term is 4, the last is 484, and the common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 fours. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. From 1-488, there are 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488). Wait, no, actually, 488 is less than 500, so the hundreds are 1, 2, 3, and 4. So, in each hundred, there's a block of 10 where the tens digit is 4. So, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The first term is 8, last term is 488. Common difference is 10. Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many blocks? Each block is 10 numbers. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) each have 10 eights in the tens place, and the last block has 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. So, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Wait, but let me check the tens place again. From 80-89: 10 eights in tens place. 180-189: another 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. So, total eights: 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the fours. Let me recount the fours: Units place: 49. Tens place: 50. Hundreds place: 89. Total: 49+50=99, plus 89=188. That's correct. Eights: Units 49, Tens 49, total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I thought about the hundreds place for fours, I considered 400-488 as 89 numbers. Let me confirm that: 488 - 400 +1 = 89. Yes, that's correct. And for the tens place, 5 blocks of 10, which is 50. Units place, 49. So, 188 fours. For eights, units 49, tens 49, so 98. So, difference is 90. Hmm, but I'm not sure if I considered all cases correctly. Let me think again. Wait, in the tens place for fours, I considered 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct. For eights in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. That seems right. So, I think my count is correct, and the difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so for 488 pages, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first 4 is at 4, then every 10 after that: 14, 24, ..., 484. The number of such numbers is floor(488 / 10) = 48 times, but wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. But does 488 include 484? Yes, because 484 is less than 488. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 (for 4 itself) = 49. So, that part was correct. Tens place: as I thought, 50 fours. Hundreds place: 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480, 481, ..., 488 is 9 numbers). Wait, no, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers? Wait, 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, that's 9 numbers. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and 1 set of 9 (480-488). So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because I thought maybe the hundreds place for fours was 89, but let me confirm. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. For the tens place, 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440 is included in 400-488, so yes, that's correct. So, 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. Units place: 49 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. I think that's correct.

Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, and there are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so the tens digit in 400-488 is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total tens place fours: 4 sets of 10 (from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349) plus 10 from 440-449, which is 5 sets, so 5*10=50. So tens place: 50 fours.

Again, we'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers?

So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would be another set, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place.

Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. So total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Wait, but earlier I thought 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 480,481,...,488. So that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 from 480-488, so 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place: 49 eights. So total eights: 49 +49=98. Now, the number of 4's is 188 and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that can't be right because I thought earlier it might be 90, but I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through the counts again. For fours: Units place: 49, tens place:50, hundreds place:89. Total: 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: Units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds place:0. Total:98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the hundreds place for fours was 89, but when I count from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. That seems correct. And for eights, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 49 in the tens place. So, yeah, 98 eights. So, the difference is 188-98=90.

Now, let me count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers.

Wait, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but the book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 is the last). Wait, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So that's 9 instead of 10. So total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 49 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Wait, but let me check units place again. Units place: 8,18,28,...,488. How many numbers is that? The first is 8, and the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So units place is 49. Tens place: as above, 49. So total 8's: 49+49=98. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but earlier I thought maybe 90, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's. Units place: 4,14,...,484. That's from 4 to 484, step 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89. So 49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units place: 49. Tens place: 40-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So that's 4*10 +9=49.

The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488. So, 8 + 10(n-1) \u2264 488 \u2192 10(n-1) \u2264 480 \u2192 n-1 \u2264 48 \u2192 n \u2264 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each full hundred block (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) contributes 10 eights in the tens place (e.g., 80-89). So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, is that right? 480-488 is 9 numbers, so in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times. So total eights in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. So, total fours are 188, and total eights are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let's go through the fours again. Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, how many numbers? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 +1 = 49. That's correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89. Total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now for the eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. Using the same formula: ((488-8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So total eights: 49+49=98. So difference is 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because I feel like maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position separately, and then sum them up. For the fours: Units: 4,14,...,484: 49 times. Tens: 40-49,140-149, etc.: 5 sets of 10, so 50. Hundreds: 400-488: 89. Total:188. For the eights: Units: 49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total:98. So the difference is indeed 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 +1 = 9). So, each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, so that's 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. So total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

    "text": " Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, the hundreds place is only 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. The tens place: each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place, and from 1-400, that's 4 sets of 100, so 4*10=40. But wait, 440-449 is the fifth set, but 440 is within 400-488. So, actually, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many is that? The last one is 484, which is 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 484 = 4 + 10(n-1). 480 = 10(n-1), so n-1=48, so n=49. So 49 fours in the units place. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The first is 8, last is 488. So, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10. 488-8=480=10(n-1). So n-1=48, so n=49. So 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Each full set (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, but the last one is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98. Wait, so 98 eights. So, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. But wait, did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me double-check the counts.

Again, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number is 488, so how many 8's in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence.

So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Let's see: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49 + 49 = 98. So, number of 8's is 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check because sometimes I might have made a mistake in counting. Let me recount the 4's in the hundreds place: from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers, correct. 400 is the first, 488 is the last, so 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 fours in hundreds place. Then, tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). Wait, that's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50 fours in tens place. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, 484 is 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 484 = 4 + 10(n-1). So, 480 = 10(n-1). So, n-1 = 48, so n=49. So, 49 fours in units place. So total 4's: 89 + 50 + 49 = 188. Now, 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488. So, 488 is 8 + (n-1)*10. 488 -8 = 480 = 10(n-1). So, n-1=48, n=49. So, 49 eights in units place. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. Hundreds place: 0. So total 8's: 49+49=98. So, difference: 188-98=90.

The hundreds place is only from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so that's correct. The tens place is 10 per hundred, so 4 sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349) and then 440-449, which is 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50. The units place is 49, as we go up to 484, which is 484/10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be another set, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Let's count how many full sets we have. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Then, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 numbers (480-488).

So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. This gives 40 + 9 = 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Hmm, wait, did I count correctly? Let me check again. Units place: 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10, and there are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but from 400-488, the tens digit can be 4, but in the hundreds place, it's 4. Wait, but in the tens place, from 400-488, the tens digit can be 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, from 0-99: 40-49:10, 100-199:140-149:10, 200-299:240-249:10, 300-399:340-349:10, 400-488:440-449:10. So, 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in numbers like 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many:\n\n- 80-89:10 numbers\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488)\n\nSo, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, right? Because from 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers. So, 10+10+10+10+9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, total eights: 49+49=98.\n\nWait, but wait, 49 in units and 49 in tens: 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, total fours are 188, total eights are 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but wait, I think I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Let me check again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. Correct.\n\nSo, total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98.\n\nSo, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For example, in the tens place for fours, I counted 50, but let me see: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place for eights, I had 49 because the last set was 480-488, which is 9 numbers instead of 10. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488.

    "text": " Wait, no, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 would be 188? Wait, 99 + 89 is 188? Wait, 99 + 89 is actually 188? Hmm, yes, because 99 + 80 is 179, plus 9 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I think the approach is similar, counting in units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 is the last page. So, how many 8's in the units place? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 count? Wait, the book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, in the tens place, 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, each of the first four sets (80-89, etc.) have 10 numbers, but the last set (480-488) has 9. So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, number of fours is 188, number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 -98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake. For fours: units place: 4,14,...,484. That's (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 =48 +1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10,140-149:10,240-249:10,340-349:10,440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each contributing a 4. So, 89. Total fours: 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place:8,18,...,488. That's (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89:10,180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. Total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).

    "text": " Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. In the tens place, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. In the units place, from 4,14,...,484. How many? Let's calculate it more accurately. The first 4 is at 4, and the last is at 484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 fours in the units place. So total fours: 89 (hundreds) + 50 (tens) + 49 (units) = 188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers, since 488 -480 +1=9). So, each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, but the last set (480-489) is cut off at 488, so only 9 numbers. So, how many eights in the tens place? 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, so total 49. Wait, no: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Wait, so 4's are 188 and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the fours: Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. That's 49 numbers. So, 89+50=139, plus 49 is 188. That seems correct. For eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is the 49th term, so 49. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.
