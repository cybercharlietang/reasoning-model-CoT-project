    "text": " Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Hmm, but wait, when I think about the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. But let me check if I'm not double-counting. No, because each digit position is separate. So, units, tens, and hundreds are counted separately. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the book. Let's count each set: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188 and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes when counting in ranges, it's easy to make a mistake. For the 4's: units place: from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers. So, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 49 numbers. That seems right. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. For the 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Hundreds place: none. So, 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This gives 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** No 8's appear here.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, starting at 8, the last one is 488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 8,18,...,488: that's 49 numbers because 488 is included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks we have. From 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, is that right? From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have 4 blocks of 10 (each contributing 10 eights) and one block contributing 9 eights. So, 4*10 +9=49. Wait, no: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, that's 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49+49=98. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake with inclusive ranges. Let me verify the count for 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct. For the tens place of 4's, I had 5 sets of 10: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct. Units place for 4's: from 4,14,...,484. How many? Let's see: 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 48 full groups, but since 484 is included, that's 49 numbers. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place: 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 is the last page. So, the number of 8's in the units place is how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but let's check if 488 is included. 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488: that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.

The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 has 9 numbers (480-488). Let me count how many sets of 100 have 8 in the tens place.

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number with an 8 in the units place is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, which gives 48 eights. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me check: starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Each 10 numbers give one 8 in the units place. So, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 when counting from 8. Wait, no, 8 is the first, 18 the second, ..., 488 would be the (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49th. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many full sets we have. Each set (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 full sets (each contributing 10) and one partial set contributing 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. I think that makes sense. Wait, but let me check the tens place for eights again. I had 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Yes, that's correct. And units place for eights is 49 because 488 is included. So, 49+49=98.

    "text": " So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me check if 480-489 is within the book. The book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the book. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, as 488 is the last page). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me double-check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total is 10*4 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, subtracting the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, right?

So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

    "text": " Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Hmm, but that seems high. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the units place. Wait, let me recount the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, starting at 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, the number of times is the number of such numbers. The formula is floor((488 - 4)/10) + 1. So, (488 - 4) is 484, divided by 10 is 48.4, so floor is 48, plus 1 is 49. So that's correct. Similarly, tens place: in each hundred, 40-49, so 10 numbers per hundred. How many hundreds are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, so up to 488, so the hundreds are 0-99 (100 numbers), 100-199 (100), 200-299 (100), 300-399 (100), and 400-488 (89). So, in each of the first four hundreds, we have 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50. That's correct. Now, hundreds place: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 = 480/10 = 48, plus 1 is 49. So 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? But the book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, which is 10 numbers. How many hundreds are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, we have 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So 4 * 10 = 40. In 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. Difference is 90. Hmm, but I feel like maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let me check the tens place for fours again. In the tens place, for each hundred, 40-49, so 10 numbers. From 0-99: 40-49 (10), 100-199:140-149 (10), 200-299:240-249 (10), 300-399:340-349 (10), and 400-488:440-449 (10). So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Correct. For eights in the tens place: 0-99:80-89 (10), 100-199:180-189 (10), 200-299:280-289 (10), 300-399:380-389 (10), and 400-488:480-488 (9). So 4*10 + 9 = 49. Correct. Units place for fours: 4,14,...,484. That's 49 numbers. Units for eights: 8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers. Hundreds place for fours: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4. Hundreds place for eights: none, as the book doesn't go beyond 488. So, yes, the counts seem correct. Therefore, the number of fours is 188, and eights is 98, so the difference is 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through each place: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction, we take 48 full tens, which gives 48 occurrences, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. Let me check: from 8 to 488 with step 10, that's (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block which might be cut short. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total eights in tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more fours than eights. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me think again about the tens place for eights. When I considered the tens place, I had 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). That's 10+10+10+10+9=49, which is correct. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place is 49, so total 98 eights. Fours are 188. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but let me double-check. Wait, from 1-99, how many fours? Units place: 9 (4,14,24,...,84). Tens place: 10 (40-49). So, 19 fours in 1-99. Then, from 100-399: Each hundred has 10 in units, 10 in tens, and 100 in hundreds? Wait, no. Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider each digit place separately across all page numbers up to 488. Let me try that again. For the units place: The number of 4's is determined by how many times 4 appears in the units digit. Since the numbers go up to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, plus an extra 4 in 484. So, 48 + 1 = 49 fours in the units place. For the tens place: The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each cycle has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (40-49, 140-149, etc.). How many such cycles are there in 488? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 full cycles (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial cycle (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50. For the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Adding them up: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many 8's in the units place? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. Let me calculate how many terms there are. The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The nth term is 8 + 10(n-1). Setting that equal to 488: 8 + 10(n-1) = 488 \u2192 10(n-1) = 480 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 80-89: 10 numbers. From 180-189: 10. From 280-289:10. From 380-389:10. And from 480-488:9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 +1 =9). Wait, no, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers (480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488). So, that's 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check. Units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, total eights: 49+49=98. Wait, no, that's units and tens. So, 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. But let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, plus 89=188. Eights: units=49, tens=49. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

    "text": " So, total 4's printed are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the units place. The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms? The sequence is 8, 18, ..., 488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. Solving for n: (n-1)*10 = 480 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total 8's printed are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract 98 from 188: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for fours. For tens place in fours, I had 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 5*10=50. That's correct. For hundreds place in fours, 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct. For eights in units: 8,18,...,488: 49 numbers. For eights in tens: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. That's correct. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449, totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488, totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear, as the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, which would give 48 eights. But wait, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me check: 8, 18, ..., 488. How many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. Solving for n: (n-1)*10 = 480 => n-1 = 48 => n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488.

Wait, let me verify: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check. Units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 49 eights. So, total eights: 49 +49=98. Hmm, but earlier I thought maybe I missed something. Wait, let me recount the tens place. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, 49 in tens place, 49 in units place, total 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the fours. Let me recount the fours: units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For the eights: units:49, tens:49, so 98. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484: 484/10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: Each hundred has 10, and there are 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, no, actually, from 0-99: 40-49, that's 10. Then 100-199:140-149, another 10. 200-299:240-249, another 10. 300-399:340-349, another 10. 400-488:440-449, which is 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8,18,28,...,488. The last number is 488, which ends with an 8. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, so let's count each block. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (from 0-399) plus 9 from 480-488. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, no: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. That's 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, the number of 4's is 188 and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. When I counted the tens place, I considered 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contributing 10, but in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, that's correct. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, total eights are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me check again. Units place for 4's: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 4's: 49+50=99, +89=188. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, so 98. 188-98=90.

    "text": " Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in units place? It's the same as the number of times 4 appears every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, and then in the last group, 480-488, 484 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence. So units: 49. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 4. There are 488 pages, so 4 hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500, but wait, 488 is less than 500. So, actually, how many hundreds are there? From 1-400: that's four hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these four has 10 numbers with tens digit 4, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total tens digit fours: 40 +10=50. That seems correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in hundreds place, so 89. So total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The last occurrence is 488, which is the 49th number because 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers.

That's 4 sets, each 10, so 40. Then, from 401-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, tens digit 8 occurs 9 times here. So total tens digit 8's:40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.

    "text": " Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the end). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because 188 seems high. Let me recount the 4's: units place: 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So that's correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. For 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488. How many? (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 =48 +1=49. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 +49=98. So, 188 -98=90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I think about it, the hundreds place for 4's only goes up to 488, which is 89 numbers, but for 8's, the hundreds place doesn't exist. So, the difference should be 90.

    "text": " Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. That's correct. Tens place: Each hundred block has 10, and there are 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49+50+89=188. Hmm, that seems high, but let me check with a smaller number. Suppose the book had 100 pages. Then units place would have 10 fours (4,14,...,94). Tens place would have 10 fours (40-49). Hundreds place would have none. So total fours would be 20. That seems correct. So 188 fours in 488 pages seems plausible. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, it's 488. So, how many terms? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 has 10 eights in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, from 480 to 488 inclusive). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9. So, for the tens place, it's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my counting again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. Difference is 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check: from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. That's correct. For eights, in the tens place, I had 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10=40 plus 9=49. That's correct. Units place: 49 eights, as 8,18,...,488. So, 49 eights. So, total eights: 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. I think that's correct.

Tens place: Each hundred has 10, and there are 5 hundreds (0-499, but since we're only going up to 488, the last hundred is 400-488, but for the tens place, it's 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.

Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, we only go up to 488. So, each of these blocks contributes 10 eights except maybe the last one. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, which is 4*10 +9=49 eights. Wait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights: 49 +49=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake with the ranges. Let me recount the fours: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

Okay, so total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's.

So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

I'll go through the same process: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full decades. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488.

Hmm, but wait, let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. That's correct. For the tens place, in fours, I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50. That seems right because 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Units place for fours: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, how many? 484-4=480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. Correct. For eights, units place: 8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. Correct. Tens place for eights: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets is 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last set, 480-488, is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 40+9=49. Correct. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   - 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   - This forms an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 10.  \n   - The number of terms is calculated as:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of terms} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{484}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n   - **Total 4's in units place:** 49\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.  \n   - Each set contains 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place.  \n   - There are 5 such sets.  \n   - **Total 4's in tens place:** 5 \u00d7 10 = 50\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 400-488.  \n   - This range includes 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive).  \n   - **Total 4's in hundreds place:** 89\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n---\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   - 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   - This forms an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 10.  \n   - The number of terms is calculated as:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of terms} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n   - **Total 8's in units place:** 49\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.  \n   - The first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contain 10 numbers.  \n   - The last set (480-488) contains 9 numbers.  \n   - **Total 8's in tens place:** 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).  \n   - **Total 8's in hundreds place:** 0\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n---\n\n**Difference between the number of 4's and 8's:**  \n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

So, that's 9 eights in the tens place for the 480-488 range. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

    "text": " So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the units digit. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers.

So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9.

Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units (49), tens (50), hundreds (89). Total: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units (49), tens (49). Total: 98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Wait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. For eights, in the tens place, I had 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, 49 in tens place, 49 in units, 0 in hundreds: 98 eights. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me check the tens place for fours again. I had 5 sets of 10: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct. And units place for fours: from 4 to 484, which is 49 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights, units place: 49, tens place: 49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct.

    "text": " So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but we need to check if 488 is included. Yes, 488 is the last page, so it includes the 8 in the units place. So, how many 8's in units place? Starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one 8. So, from 8 to 488, that's (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Wait, that seems correct because 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

Each block of 100 numbers (e.g., 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, that's 9 instead of 10 because 489 is beyond 488. So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, which is 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place because I might have made a mistake. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. That's 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. So total eights are 49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

    "text": " Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Hmm, but wait, when I count the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let me find how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Each set from 80-89, 180-189, etc., has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49+49=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake in counting. Let me recount the fours: Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? The formula is floor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10)=48, but wait, that might not be right. Alternatively, the number of times a digit appears in the units place up to N is given by (N // 10) + 1 if the units digit is >= the digit, else (N // 10). Wait, perhaps a better way is to calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place. For each 10 numbers, it appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many tens are there? 488 // 10 = 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48. But wait, does 488 include an extra 4 in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, meaning 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48 fours. But wait, 488 itself is 488, which ends with an 8, not a 4, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, units place for fours is 48, not 49. Wait, earlier I thought it was 49, but now I'm confused. Let me clarify: The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is equal to (N // 10) + 1 if the units digit of N is >= d, otherwise (N // 10). Wait, let's test this with N=488. The units digit is 8. We're looking for how many times 4 appears in the units place. Since 8 >=4, it's (488 //10) +1 =48 +1=49. So, that's correct. So, units place for fours is 49. Similarly, for eights, units place: N=488, units digit is 8, so (488//10)+1=48+1=49. So, that's correct. Now, for tens place, fours: Each block of 100 numbers has 10 fours in the tens place. From 1-100:40-49:10 fours. Similarly, 101-200:140-149:10, 201-300:240-249:10, 301-400:340-349:10, and 401-488:440-449:10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. So, tens place for fours is 50. Hundreds place for fours: From 400-488: that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, for eights: Units place:49, tens place: Let's recount. Tens digit is 8 in 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4*10=40 +9=49. So, tens place for eights is 49. Hundreds place: no eights, as before. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but I thought earlier I had 188 fours and 98 eights, so the difference is 90. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, in the hundreds place for fours, from 400-488: that's 89 numbers, correct. 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours there. For the tens place, fours: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449: each is 10, so 5*10=50. Units place:49. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. So, 98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.  \n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, so \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all page numbers from 400 to 488.  \n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\( 49 \\) (units) + \\( 50 \\) (tens) + \\( 89 \\) (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.  \n   - The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last range contributes 9.  \n   - Total: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 0 \\).\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\( 49 \\) (units) + \\( 49 \\) (tens) + \\( 0 \\) (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = \\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in units place? The first is 4, and the last is 484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So that's correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in tens place. From 0-488, how many hundreds? 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So that's 5 hundreds. Each contributes 10 fours, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the count is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So 49 eights in units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have 8 in tens place? Yes, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, each hundred has 10 numbers with 8 in tens place. From 0-488, how many hundreds? 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, 5 hundreds. Each contributes 10 eights in tens place, so 5*10=50. But wait, in the last hundred (400-488), the tens digit 8 is present in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the hundreds place, 400-488: tens digit 8 appears 9 times, not 10. So, total tens place eights: 4 hundreds with 10 each (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399) and 1 hundred with 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check the counts. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me think again about the tens place for eights. In the last hundred, 400-488, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4 hundreds (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399) each have 10 eights in tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, the last hundred (400-488) has 9 eights in tens place. So, total tens eights:40+9=49. That's correct. So, eights total:49+49=98. Fours total:188. So, 188-98=90.

Let me find how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because it starts at 8.

Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-488: how many numbers? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, which is 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

For the hundreds place in fours: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct. For the eights: units: 8,18,...,488: 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.

From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Yes, that's correct. For the tens place, I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50, correct. Units place: 49, correct. For eights, units place: 49, correct. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, so 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, correct.

Correct.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,...,488. Same formula: (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488.\n\nFrom 80-89:10 numbers.\n\n180-189:10.\n\n280-289:10.\n\n380-389:10.\n\n480-488: 488-480+1=9 numbers.\n\nSo total tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: none, as 800-899 is beyond 488. So 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488 inclusive. So, 488 - 400 +1 = 89. Correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers (since 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9). So that's correct.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '4' appears in the units place in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. Hmm, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Wait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of this. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such blocks we have. From 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 10 times in each of the first four blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), which is 4*10=40, plus 9 in the last block (400-488). So total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Let's see, 488 is the last page. So, how many 8's in the units place? The first is 8, the next is 18, and so on up to 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 is included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488.

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. Hmm, but wait, does the hundreds place actually go up to 488? Yes, because the book has 488 pages, so 400-488 is correct, which is 89 numbers. So total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so we have 49 occurrences. Wait, but does 488 count as the 49th? Let's check: starting at 8, each 10 numbers adds one. So, 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is floor((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = floor(480/10) +1=48 +1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would be next, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, each of these blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks are within 488. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 +1=9). So, total eights in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, which is 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9.

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, total fours are 188, total eights are 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts because 90 seems like a big difference. Let me go through each digit place again for both digits to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor fours:\n- Units: 49. Let me recount. From 4 to 484, every 10 numbers. So, 4,14,24,...,484.
