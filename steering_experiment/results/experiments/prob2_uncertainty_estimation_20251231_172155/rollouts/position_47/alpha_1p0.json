    "text": " Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, let's count each block. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So total is 10*4 +9 =40 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For the eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. But wait, let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for the eights. In the tens place, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. Similarly, for fours in the tens place, it's 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50. That's correct. Units place for fours: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, 484 is the 49th number. So, 49 fours in units place. So, 49+50+89=188. Eights: 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, especially in the hundreds place, I might have missed something. Let me think again. For hundreds place in fours: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. That seems correct. For eights in hundreds place: none, since the book ends at 488. So, yes, 0. So, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set has 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This is 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me count how many full sets there are and then the partial set. From 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 full sets of 10, which is 40, plus 9 in the last partial set, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For the units place of fours, I had 49, which seems right because from 4,14,...484, which is 484-4=480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. For tens place, 5 sets of 10, so 50. Hundreds place from 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Total fours: 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor eights, units place: 49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. Total eights:98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place in fours, each hundred block has 10 fours in the tens place, and there are 5 hundred blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, actually, 400-488 is part of the 400-499 block, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit in 440-449 is still 4, so that's 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 50 fours in the tens place. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights, in the tens place, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five blocks, each contributing 10 except the last one, which contributes 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. That's correct.\n\nSo, the total fours are 188, eights are 98, so the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when counting the units place for fours, I had 49. Let me check: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, starting at 4. So, the positions are 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The last term is 484, which is 4 + 10*(n-1) =484. So, 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 fours in the units place. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in the units place: 8,18,28,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 8 +10*(n-1)=488. So, 10*(n-1)=480, n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. Correct.\n\nTens place for fours: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-499). But since we only go up to 488, the last block is 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 50. Correct.\n\nTens place for eights: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9 eights (since 480-488 is 9 numbers:480,481,...,488). So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for fours: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for eights: none, since the book only goes up to 488. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188.\n\nEights:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems right. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Count the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 fours, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\n   Total 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Count the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This sequence has 49 terms.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n   Total 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - More 4's than 8's = 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 90 more times than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Wait, no. Wait, 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49.

But 480-489 is only up to 488, so that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, the first four sets have 10 each, and the last set has 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place.

Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. Yes.

There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit 4 appears in all page numbers from 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\n   Total 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place (Ones Place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 8 appears in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit 8 does not appear in any page number since the book ends at 488.\n\n   Total 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488.

So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's recount the fours: Units place: from 4,14,...484.

Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. For the eights: Units place:8,18,...488. 488 is included, so (488-8)/10 +1=48.8, so 49. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10, the last has 9, so 4*10 +9=49. Hundreds place:0. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer is 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me make sure I didn't overcount or undercount somewhere. For the hundreds place in fours: 400-488 is correct, that's 89 numbers. For the tens place in fours: 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. For the eights, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, which is correct because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...488).

But 480-489 is beyond 488, so only up to 488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place for the 480-488 range.

Wait, 480-489 is 10 numbers, but the book only goes up to 488, so it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights in the tens place, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 eights. So, that's 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, let me check again. Units:49, tens:49, so total 98. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

But 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) have 10 eights in the tens place, and the last set (480-488) has 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9 =40 +9=49.

Wait, but earlier I thought units and tens each had 49, so 49+49=98. So, total eights:98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) -98 (eights)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers. Let me just double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right.
