    "text": " So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one which only goes up to 488. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last one). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the eights in the tens place. The last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's correct, 9 eights in the tens place for that set. So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. Yep, that's right. So, the difference is 90.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That looks correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Hmm, but wait, did I count the hundreds place correctly? For fours, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. For eights, since the book only goes up to 488, there's no hundreds digit of 8, so that's correct. Also, in the tens place for eights, I had 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so that's correct. Wait, but let me check the units place again. For fours: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. 484-4=480, 480/10=48, so 48+1=49. That's correct. For eights: from 8 to 488, same logic: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place for fours: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. For eights in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last one is only 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49. Correct. So, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the difference is 188-98=90.

So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me make sure. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yep, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That's correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I feel like that might not be accurate. Let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. For the tens place in fours, it's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Units place in fours: 49, which is correct because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. For eights, units place: 49, tens place:49, so total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the tens place for fours. Let me recount. Tens place for fours: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets of 10, which is 50. That's correct. So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place. So, the calculation seems correct.

Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.

So, 5 blocks of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. That seems right. Similarly, for the units place, 4 appears 49 times, which is correct because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 times. Wait, no, 488 is included, so from 4 to 484, that's 484-4=480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, correct. For the eights, units place: 49 times, correct. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, 10 each for the first four, and 9 for the last. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. So, total eights:49+49=98.

    "text": " So, let's count how many numbers have 8 in the tens place. From 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, yes, 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers. Wait, let me just cross-verify my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. Yes, that's correct. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting, we get 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
