So that's 9 numbers. So total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so total 98 eights.

    "text": " Each of these sets contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one, which only has 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, how many full sets do we have? The first four sets: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights. Then, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, contributing 9 eights. So total eights in the tens place: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800 or above. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me check that again. Units:49, tens:49, so 49+49=98. Yep. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For the tens place of 4's, I had 50, which was from 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's five sets of 10, so 50. For the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89. Units place: 49. 49+50+89=188. For the 8's, units place:49, tens place:49 (from 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488). Wait, 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So that's 4*10 +9=49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct.

Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place.

Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\nTo solve this, we count the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This gives 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, how many sets do we have? Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last block, which only goes up to 488. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place for the last block. So, total eights in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, 40+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yep, that looks correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

The first four blocks contribute 40, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, how many sets? Each full set (like 80-89) has 10 numbers, but the last set is only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 full sets (40) plus 9, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, no, wait. Each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, etc.) gives 10 eights in the tens place, and the last set (480-488) gives 9 eights because it stops at 488. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90.
