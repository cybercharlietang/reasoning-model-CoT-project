Wait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility I double-counted or missed something? For example, in the hundreds place for 4's, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Correct. For 8's, in the hundreds place, none, since the book ends at 488. So, that's correct. Units and tens places seem correctly counted. So, I think 90 is the right answer. Wait, but let me think about the tens place for 4's: 440-449. Since the book goes up to 488, 440-449 is within that, so that's correct.

Correct. - Tens:80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because in the hundreds place, 4's go up to 488, which is 89 numbers, but 8's don't have any in the hundreds place. So, that's a big difference there. Let me see if I missed anything. Alternatively, maybe I should use a formula or a more systematic approach to count the digits. Let me try that. For each digit position, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear. Let's do this for each position separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - For each complete set of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - Number of complete sets in 488 pages: 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing 1, so 48.\n   - But wait, the last set might not be complete. The last page is 488, which is in the 48th set (since 48*10=480, so 480-489, but our last page is 488). So, in the units place, from 1-488, the number of 4's is 48 (from 4,14,...,474) plus the 488? Wait, no, 488 is 8 in the units place, so the last 4 in the units place is 474. So, 48 times.\n\n   Wait, earlier I thought it was 49. Hmm, this is conflicting. Let me check: from 1-488, how many numbers end with 4? They are 4,14,24,...,474,484. Wait, 484 is within 488, so that's another one. So, from 4 to 484, that's how many numbers? The first term is 4, the last is 484, step 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. So, units place has 49 fours. So, my initial count was correct.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - For each block of 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 ten times. So, in each 100-number block, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n   - Number of complete 100-number blocks in 488: 4 (since 400 is the start of the 4th block). Wait, no, 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500. But our book ends at 488, so the last block is 401-488, which is only 88 numbers, not a full 100. So, in each full 100-number block, we have 10 fours in the tens place. How many full blocks are there? 400 is the start of the 4th block, but we have 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, the full blocks are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, in the last partial block (401-488), how many fours in the tens place? The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 fours. So, total tens place fours:40+10=50. Correct.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 -400 +1=89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers:8,18,28,...,488.\n   - Number of terms: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In each 100-number block, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Full blocks:1-100,101-200,201-300,301-400. Each contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 blocks *10=40.\n   - Last partial block:401-488. Here, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers:480,481,...,488. So, 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8.\n   - So, total tens place eights:40+9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so no eights here.\n\nTotal eights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (fours) -98 (eights)=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n\nBut let me just think again: when counting the tens place for 8's in the last block, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers. But wait, 480 has 8 in the tens place, and so does 481, up to 488. So, that's 9 numbers, correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence.\n\nYes, I think my counts are accurate. So, the final answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we'll count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 48.4 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block which has 9 (480-488).\n   - Total: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**\n\n\\boxed{90}"
