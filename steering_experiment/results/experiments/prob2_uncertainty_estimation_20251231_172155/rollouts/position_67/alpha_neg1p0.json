But when counting the tens place for 8's, in the 480-488 range, that's 9 numbers, right? So, that seems correct. Another way to check: Maybe using a formula or a different approach. Alternatively, I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position. For a number from 1 to N, the count of a digit d in each position can be calculated using a formula, but since I'm dealing with a specific N (488), maybe breaking it down as I did is better. Alternatively, for the hundreds place, since 488 is less than 500, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. For 4's in hundreds place, it's from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. For 8's, since 800 is beyond 488, there are none. So, that's correct. Similarly, for the tens and units places, as I did before. So, I think my counts are accurate.

Hmm, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct. But when I count the hundreds place for 4's, it's 89 fours. So, that's correct. But wait, let me check if 488 is included. Yes, 488 is page 488, so 488 -400 +1=89. Correct. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except 480-488 which contributes 9.\n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, 89. So, total 49+50+89=188. Correct. Now for the 8's: - Units place:8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, so 48+1=49. Correct. - Tens place:80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly for the hundreds place in the 4's? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Yes, that's correct. And for the 8's, since the hundreds place doesn't have any 8's, that's 0. So, yeah, 90 seems to be the correct difference.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Wait, but I just thought, does 488 count as an 8 in the units place? Yes, because 488 is page 488, which ends with an 8, so it's included in the units count. Similarly, in the tens place, 480-488 includes 480,481,...,488, so that's 9 numbers, correct. So, yes, 98 eights. So, 188-98=90.
