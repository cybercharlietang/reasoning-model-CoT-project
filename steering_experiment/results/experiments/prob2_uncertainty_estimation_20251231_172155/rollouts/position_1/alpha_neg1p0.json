    "text": " \n\nFirst, I need to understand how page numbers are structured. Each page number is a three-digit number, right? Wait, no, actually, page numbers can be one, two, or three digits depending on the page. But since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, pages 1-9 are single-digit, 10-99 are two-digit, and 100-488 are three-digit numbers. \n\nBut maybe it's easier to think of all page numbers as three-digit by padding with leading zeros. So, page 1 would be 001, page 10 would be 010, and so on. That might make it easier to count the number of times each digit appears in each position (hundreds, tens, ones). \n\nWait, but leading zeros aren't actually printed, so maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, I can consider each digit place separately: hundreds, tens, and ones. For each place, I'll count how many times the digit 4 appears and how many times 8 appears, then subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place one by one.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - For every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in the units place. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers, and the same goes for 8.\n   - Since the book has 488 pages, let's see how many complete groups of 10 there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups and 8 extra numbers (481 to 488).\n   - In each complete group of 10, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for 48 groups, that's 48 times each.\n   - Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1 through 8. So, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488).\n   - So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - So, in the units place, 4 and 8 appear the same number of times. So, the difference here is zero.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens place cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place within each hundred.\n   - For example, from 0-99, the tens digit is 0 for 0-9, 1 for 10-19, ..., 9 for 90-99. Each digit appears 10 times.\n   - So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times.\n   - Now, since the book has 488 pages, we have 4 complete hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 88 more pages (400-488).\n   - For each of the 4 complete hundreds, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 for both 4 and 8.\n   - Now, looking at the incomplete hundred from 400-488. The tens digit here cycles from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the end). So, let's see:\n     - From 400-409: tens digit is 0\n     - 410-419: tens digit is 1\n     - ...\n     - 480-488: tens digit is 8\n     - So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? Well, 440-449 would have 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n     - How about 8? 480-488: the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers (480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last). Wait, actually, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so it's 9 numbers. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here.\n   - So, in the incomplete hundred:\n     - 4 appears 10 times\n     - 8 appears 9 times\n   - Adding to the previous 40 each:\n     - Total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50\n     - Total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49\n   - So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. The difference here is 1.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds place is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, pages 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit, so we can ignore those.\n   - From 100-488, the hundreds digit goes from 1 to 4. Let's break it down:\n     - 100-199: hundreds digit is 1\n     - 200-299: hundreds digit is 2\n     - 300-399: hundreds digit is 3\n     - 400-488: hundreds digit is 4\n   - So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n   - How about 8? 8 in the hundreds place would be pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n   - Therefore, in the hundreds place:\n     - 4 appears 89 times\n     - 8 appears 0 times\n   - The difference here is 89.\n\nNow, let's sum up the differences from each place:\n\n- Units place: 0\n- Tens place: +1\n- Hundreds place: +89\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations, especially for the tens and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the tens place again:\n\nFrom 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit, how many times does it appear?\n\n- 400-409: tens digit 0 (10 times)\n- 410-419: tens digit 1 (10 times)\n- 420-429: tens digit 2 (10 times)\n- 430-439: tens digit 3 (10 times)\n- 440-449: tens digit 4 (10 times)\n- 450-459: tens digit 5 (10 times)\n- 460-469: tens digit 6 (10 times)\n- 470-479: tens digit 7 (10 times)\n- 480-488: tens digit 8 (9 times)\n\nWait, so in the tens place from 400-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, that part was correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and 8 never appears. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n- Units: 0\n- Tens: 50 (4's) - 49 (8's) = +1\n- Hundreds: 89 (4's) - 0 (8's) = +89\n\nTotal difference: 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm being told that the book has 488 pages, so page 488 is included. So, in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again: 400 is the first page with 4 in the hundreds place, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 89 times 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, that's consistent with the earlier calculation. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me check the units place again. I thought that in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. Let me confirm that.\n\nTotal pages: 488\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: 48 (since 48*10=480), with 8 remaining pages (481-488).\n\nIn each group of 10, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, 48 groups * 1 = 48 each.\n\nIn the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, from 1-488:\n\nEach hundred (0-99, 100-199, etc.) has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) give 4*10=40 each. Then, in 400-488, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 +9=49 for 8.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - 488 pages mean 48 complete groups of 10 and 8 extra numbers.\n   - 4 and 8 each appear 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times in each hundred.\n   - 488 pages include 4 complete hundreds and 88 extra pages.\n   - In the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (from 400-488), while 8 appears 0 times.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:**\n188 - 98 = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I should probably understand what the question is asking. It's about counting the occurrences of the digit 4 and the digit 8 in all the page numbers from 1 to 488. Then, I need to find the difference between the number of 4's and 8's. That makes sense.\n\nI think the best approach is to count how many times each digit appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) separately and then sum them up. So, I'll start by considering each digit place one by one.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For the units digit, the digits cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. \n\nFor example, from 1-10: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. Here, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, 4 appears once, and 8 appears once.\n\nSince the book has 488 pages, I can divide 488 by 10 to see how many complete blocks of 10 there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and an extra 8 pages (since 48*10=480, and 488-480=8). \n\nIn each complete block, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, for 48 blocks, that's 48 times each. Now, I need to check the extra 8 pages, which are from 481 to 488. Let's list their units digits: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in these, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). \n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 (from the blocks) + 1 (from the extra) = 49. Similarly, the total number of 8's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, both digits appear the same number of times. \n\nWait, that's interesting. So, the count for units place is equal for both digits. Let me move on to the tens place now.\n\nIn the tens place, digits cycle every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, for the tens place, I can think of the 488 pages as 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and an extra 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each full hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). \n\nSo, for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10=40 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place. \n\nNow, looking at the extra 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). Let's break this down:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0 (10 numbers)\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1 (10 numbers)\n- ...\n- 481-490: tens digit is 8 (but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 numbers: 481-488)\n\nWait, no, actually, 401-488 is 88 numbers, so that's 8 full tens blocks (401-410, 411-420,...,471-480) and then 481-488, which is 8 numbers. \n\nSo, in the tens place, for the extra 88 pages:\n\n- The digit 4 appears in the tens place for the block 441-450, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 401-488 includes 441-450 as part of the 401-480 range, right? So, 441-450 is within 401-480, so the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (441-450). \n\nSimilarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers.\n\nTherefore, in the extra 88 pages, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the digit 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, total for the tens place:\n\n- 4: 4*10 (from the hundreds) + 10 (from the extra) = 40 + 10 = 50\n- 8: 4*10 (from the hundreds) + 8 (from the extra) = 40 + 8 = 48\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 48 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit changes every 100 numbers. For a 488-page book, the hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me correct that. Actually, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct either. Because page 1 is 1, which is a single digit, but when we talk about hundreds digit, it's part of a three-digit number. So, page 1 would be 001, but in reality, page numbers don't have leading zeros, so the hundreds digit is only present when the page number is 100 or above.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place?\n\n- Digit 0: pages 1-99: 99 pages, but since we're considering the hundreds digit, it's actually 0 for all these pages, but since we're counting digits, each page from 1-99 has a hundreds digit of 0, but we don't count leading zeros in page numbers. So, actually, the hundreds digit is only present starting from page 100. So, for pages 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so we don't count it. So, the hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199 (100 numbers), 2 for 200-299 (100 numbers), 3 for 300-399 (100 numbers), and 4 for 400-488 (89 numbers, since 488-400+1=89).\n\nWait, 400-488 is 89 pages: 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit:\n\n- 1: 100 times (100-199)\n- 2: 100 times (200-299)\n- 3: 100 times (300-399)\n- 4: 89 times (400-488)\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? 89 times.\n\nHow about 8? The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is in 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times\n- 8 appears 0 times\n\nNow, let me summarize the counts for each digit in each place:\n\n- Units place:\n  - 4: 49\n  - 8: 49\n\n- Tens place:\n  - 4: 50\n  - 8: 48\n\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 4: 89\n  - 8: 0\n\nNow, I need to add up the counts for each digit across all places.\n\nTotal number of 4's:\n\nUnits: 49\n\nTens: 50\n\nHundreds: 89\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate that.\n\n49 + 50 = 99\n\n99 + 89 = 188\n\nSo, 4 appears 188 times.\n\nTotal number of 8's:\n\nUnits: 49\n\nTens: 48\n\nHundreds: 0\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nSo, 8 appears 97 times.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's.\n\n188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91\n\nSo, there are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n- 488 pages, so 48 full tens and 8 extra pages.\n\nEach full ten has one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 each.\n\nIn the extra 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units: 48+1=49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would have 4*10=40 each.\n\nIn the extra 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8.\n\nFor 4 in the tens place: it's in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place: it's in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times.\n\nSo, total tens:\n\n4: 40 +10=50\n\n8:40 +8=48\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\n8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, hundreds:\n\n4:89\n\n8:0\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)= 49+50=99; 99+89=188\n\n8's:49 (units)+48 (tens)+0=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that?\n\n488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, that's correct.\n\nAnd since the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nFor the tens place, in the extra 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. And 8 in the tens place is for 481-488, which is 8 numbers, correct.\n\nUnits place: correct as well.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 97, so the difference is 91.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, there are 91 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference between their counts.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total complete tens: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8).\n   - Each digit appears 48 times in the units place.\n   - Extra 8 pages (481-488): 4 appears once (484), 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - Complete hundreds: 4 (1-400).\n   - Each digit appears 40 times in the tens place.\n   - Extra 88 pages (401-488):\n     - 4 appears in 441-450: 10 times.\n     - 8 appears in 481-488: 8 times.\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 1-99: No hundreds digit.\n   - Pages 100-199: Hundreds digit 1 (100 times).\n   - Pages 200-299: Hundreds digit 2 (100 times).\n   - Pages 300-399: Hundreds digit 3 (100 times).\n   - Pages 400-488: Hundreds digit 4 (89 times).\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89.\n   - Total 8's: 0.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - More 4's than 8's: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 91.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

So, from 1 to 10, 4 appears once (at 4). This pattern repeats every 10 numbers. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488? \n\n488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48*1 = 48 times. But wait, in the 48th set, which is 480-489, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 481-490, but we stop at 488. So, in the units place, the 48th set would be 480-489, but we only go up to 488, so the 4 in 484 is still included. So, 48 sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times.\n\nWait, but let me check. From 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is how many? The first 4 is at 4, then 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The nth term can be expressed as 10n - 6, where n starts at 1. Wait, no, actually, the units digit is 4 every 10 numbers. So, the number of times is floor(488 / 10) = 48 times, but since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is less than 4, so we don't have an extra 4 in the units place beyond the 48th set. So, units place for 4's is 48.\n\n**Tens place:**\nNow, for the tens place, 4 appears in the tens digit every 100 numbers, specifically from 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place.\n\nHow many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, from 1-100, 10 times; 101-200, another 10; 201-300, another 10; 301-400, another 10; and 401-488, which is another partial block. Wait, let me think again.\n\nActually, each hundred has one block where the tens digit is 4, and each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, from 1-400, there are 4 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), each contributing 10 4's. So, that's 4*10 = 40.\n\nNow, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. So, that's another 10 occurrences. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So, that's another 10. So total tens place 4's would be 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so another 10. So total is 50.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that's correct.\n\n**Hundreds place:**\nNow, for the hundreds place, 4 appears in the hundreds digit from 400-488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400 is included, so 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, moving on to 8's.\n\n**Units place:**\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, it's every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nUsing the same approach as for 4's: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. So, 48 times. But wait, let me check the last set: 488 is included, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, yes, 48 times.\n\n**Tens place:**\nFor the tens place, 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nFrom 1-400, how many such blocks are there? Each hundred has one such block, so 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 8's. So, 4*10=40.\n\nNow, from 401-488, does the tens digit ever reach 8? The next block would be 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 +1 = 9 numbers. So, 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me confirm: 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), each with 8 in the tens place. So, yes, 9.\n\n**Hundreds place:**\nNow, does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 48 + 49 is 97. So, 97 8's in total.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me go through each step again.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n\n- Units place: 48 times. Correct, as each 10 numbers contribute one 4, and 488/10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each with one 4 in the units place.\n\n- Tens place: 50 times. From 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. Wait, earlier I thought it was 4 blocks up to 400, but actually, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is another 10. So, total 5 blocks, 50 times. That's correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 times. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Correct.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n\n- Units place: 48 times. Correct, same logic as 4's.\n\n- Tens place: 49 times. From 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0 times. Correct, since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 48 + 49 = 97. Correct.\n\nDifference: 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When counting the tens place for 8's, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but the units digits go from 0-8, so that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the units place, 488 is included, so the last 8 in the units place is at 488. So, 48 times.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place count again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place? The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. So, how many terms? It's the number of times 8 appears in the units place. The nth term can be expressed as 10n - 2, where n starts at 1. So, 10n - 2 \u2264 488. Let's solve for n:\n\n10n - 2 \u2264 488\n10n \u2264 490\nn \u2264 49.\n\nWait, that suggests 49 terms, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, this is a discrepancy.\n\nWait, let me list some numbers:\n\n- 8: 1st term\n- 18: 2nd\n- ...\n- 488: nth term.\n\nSo, 488 = 10n - 2\nSo, 10n = 490\nn = 49.\n\nSo, that suggests there are 49 numbers with 8 in the units place from 1 to 488. But earlier, I thought it was 48. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, 488 is the 49th term because starting from 8 as the first term, each 10 numbers add one more. So, 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, the count should be 49, not 48. Hmm, that changes things.\n\nWait, let me recalculate the units place for both 4's and 8's.\n\nFor 4's in units place:\n\nThe last number with 4 in the units place before 488 is 484, which is 484 = 10*48 + 4. So, 48 times.\n\nBut for 8's, the last number is 488, which is 10*49 - 2, so 49th occurrence. So, units place for 8's is 49, not 48.\n\nWait, so I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, for 8's in units place: 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in units place: 48 times, as the last 4 in units place is 484, which is 10*48 +4, so 48 times.\n\nSo, that affects the total counts.\n\nLet me recalculate the total 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49 (as before)\n- Hundreds place: 0\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, so that's 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's:\n\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nSo, difference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, so I had an error in the units place count for 8's. It's actually 49, not 48. So, the total 8's are 98, and 4's are 187, so the difference is 89.\n\nWait, let me confirm again:\n\nFor 8's in units place: numbers are 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The nth term is 10n - 2. Set 10n -2 \u2264 488.\n\n10n \u2264 490 \u2192 n \u2264 49. So, 49 terms. So, 49 times 8 in units place.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in units place: numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. The nth term is 10n -6. 10n -6 \u2264 488 \u2192 10n \u2264 494 \u2192 n \u2264 49.4, so n=49. But wait, 10*49 -6 = 484, which is \u2264488, so 49 terms. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, now I'm confused.\n\nWait, let me list some:\n\n- 4: 1st term\n- 14: 2nd\n- ...\n- 484: 49th term, since 484 = 10*49 -6 = 490 -6=484.\n\nSo, that's 49 terms. So, units place for 4's is 49, not 48. Wait, so I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page. So, 484 is within 488, so it's included. So, units place for 4's is 49.\n\nSimilarly, units place for 8's is 49.\n\nSo, that changes the counts.\n\nSo, let's correct the counts:\n\n**4's:**\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**8's:**\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, now I'm getting back to the original difference of 90, but I'm confused because I thought I made a mistake in the units place count.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nFor units place:\n\n- For 4's: The numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. The nth term is 10n -6. The maximum n where 10n -6 \u2264488 is n=49, since 10*49 -6=484 \u2264488, and 10*50 -6=494>488. So, 49 times.\n\n- For 8's: The numbers are 8,18,28,...,488. The nth term is 10n -2. The maximum n where 10n -2 \u2264488 is n=49, since 10*49 -2=488, which is exactly the last page. So, 49 times.\n\nSo, both units places have 49 counts.\n\nSo, correcting the earlier mistake:\n\n**4's:**\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**8's:**\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the units place for 4's was 48, but now it's 49. So, the correct total for 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nBut let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 480-488, that's 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place, right? 480,481,...,488. So, 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, 9 occurrences. So, in the tens place, 8's are 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, from 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, total 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50.\n\nSo, 4's in tens place: 50.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each with 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, 4's total: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's total:49 (units)+49 (tens)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the units place for 4's was 48, but now it's 49. Let me check that again.\n\nFor 4's in units place:\n\nThe sequence is 4,14,24,...,484.\n\nThe nth term is 10n -6. So, 10n -6 \u2264488.\n\n10n \u2264494 \u2192n \u226449.4, so n=49.\n\nSo, 49 terms, meaning 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place, it's 8,18,...,488, which is 49 terms.\n\nSo, both units places have 49 counts.\n\nTherefore, the total counts are as above, leading to a difference of 90.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure because initially I thought 48, but now it's 49. Let me think differently.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place?\n\nThe first is 4, the last is 484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, the first is 8, the last is 488. Number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1=(480/10)+1=48+1=49.\n\nSo, both units places have 49 counts.\n\nTherefore, the initial mistake was in the units place counts for both digits, thinking it was 48, but it's actually 49.\n\nSo, the correct total counts are:\n\n4's:49+50+89=188\n\n8's:49+49=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAnd in the tens place, 4's:5 blocks of 10, so 50.\n\nUnits:49.\n\nSo, 188 total 4's.\n\n8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98.\n\nDifference:90.\n\nYes, that seems correct now.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, ..., 484 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should understand the problem clearly. Each page from 1 to 488 has a page number, and I need to count how many times the digit '4' appears in all these numbers and how many times '8' appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nSo, the plan is to calculate the total number of 4's and 8's in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and then find the difference between these two counts.\n\nLet me start by considering how digits are structured in page numbers. Page numbers can be one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit numbers. Since 488 is a three-digit number, I'll have to consider each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nI think the best approach is to calculate the number of times each digit (4 and 8) appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers up to 488.\n\nLet's break it down by each digit position.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor the units digit, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. However, since we're starting from 1, the first block is 1-10, where the units digits are 1-0. So, in each block of 10, the digit '4' appears once in the units place, and the digit '8' also appears once.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488).\n\nIn each complete block, the units digit '4' appears once, so for 48 blocks, that's 48 times. Similarly, '8' appears once per block, so also 48 times.\n\nNow, let's check the partial block from 481 to 488. The units digits here are 1 through 8. So, in this partial block, '4' appears once (at 484) and '8' appears once (at 488). So, adding these, the total number of '4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for '8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so the units digits go up to 8, not 9. So, in the units place, '4' appears once in the partial block, and '8' appears once as well. So, units place contributes 49 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\nHmm, but let me make sure. For the units digit, each complete block of 10 contributes 1 '4' and 1 '8'. There are 48 complete blocks, so 48 each. Then, the last 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so '4' is at 484 and '8' is at 488. So, units digits: 49 '4's and 49 '8's. That seems correct.\n\nNext, let's move to the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, digits cycle every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each set of 100 numbers, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, actually, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place in each 100-number block.\n\nBut since we're dealing with 488 pages, which is less than 500, we can consider the tens place in the first 400 pages and then the remaining 88 pages.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to think in terms of hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to handle the tens digit by considering how many times each digit appears in the tens place across all numbers up to 488.\n\nLet me think. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers, and each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each 100-number block.\n\nSo, for 488 pages, how many complete 100-number blocks are there? 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for each digit, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\nThen, we have the remaining 88 pages (401-488). Let's analyze the tens digit in this range.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). Wait, no, 401-410 is tens digit 0, 411-420 is 1, up to 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, the tens digits go up to 8 (480-488).\n\nSo, the tens digit in 401-488 is as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 numbers)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10 numbers)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10 numbers)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10 numbers)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 numbers)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10 numbers)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10 numbers)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10 numbers)\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 numbers)\n\nWait, but from 401-488, that's 88 numbers. Let me check: 488 - 400 = 88, so 401-488 is 88 numbers.\n\nSo, in the tens place, how many times does each digit appear?\n\nDigits 0-7 each appear 10 times, and digit 8 appears 8 times.\n\nWait, no, because 401-488 is 88 numbers. Let's see:\n\n- 401-410: 10 numbers, tens digit 0\n- 411-420: 10 numbers, tens digit 1\n- 421-430: 10 numbers, tens digit 2\n- 431-440: 10 numbers, tens digit 3\n- 441-450: 10 numbers, tens digit 4\n- 451-460: 10 numbers, tens digit 5\n- 461-470: 10 numbers, tens digit 6\n- 471-480: 10 numbers, tens digit 7\n- 481-488: 8 numbers, tens digit 8\n\nSo, digits 0-7 each appear 10 times, and digit 8 appears 8 times.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place, for the 401-488 range:\n\n- '4' appears 10 times (from 441-450)\n- '8' appears 8 times (from 481-488)\n\nSo, adding to the previous 400 pages, where each digit appeared 40 times (4 blocks * 10 each), we have:\n\nTotal '4's in tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50\nTotal '8's in tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 8 (from 401-488) = 48\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check again.\n\nWait, from 1-400, each digit in the tens place appears 40 times (since 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10 times). So, '4' appears 40 times in the tens place from 1-400, and in 401-488, '4' appears 10 times (from 441-450). So, total '4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, '8's in tens place from 1-400: 40 times, and in 401-488, '8's appear 8 times (from 481-488). So, total '8's in tens place: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because in the 401-488 range, the tens digit for '8' is only from 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so '8' appears 8 times in the tens place there. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, moving on, now let's check the hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, the digits change every 100 numbers. For a 488-page book, the hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit '4' appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Therefore, the digit '4' appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nThe digit '8' never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, and 3 for 300-399, etc. So, '8' never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total '4's in hundreds place: 89\nTotal '8's in hundreds place: 0\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each position.\n\nFor '4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal '4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor '8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal '8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more '4's are printed than '8's. So, subtract the total '8's from the total '4's: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, let me double-check these calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n- 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing 1 '4' and 1 '8', so 48 each.\n- Partial block of 8 numbers (481-488) contributes 1 '4' (484) and 1 '8' (488).\n- So, units '4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n- Units '8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\nTens place:\n- From 1-400: 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10 '4's and 10 '8's in the tens place. So, 4*10 = 40 each.\n- From 401-488: '4' appears 10 times (441-450), and '8' appears 8 times (481-488).\n- So, tens '4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n- Tens '8's: 40 + 8 = 48\n\nHundreds place:\n- '4' appears 89 times (400-488)\n- '8' appears 0 times\n\nAdding up:\n- '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- '8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is '4' for all of them, correct. So, 89 '4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but when I think about the hundreds digit, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's 0. From 100-199, it's '1', 200-299 '2', 300-399 '3', and 400-488 '4'. So, yes, '4' appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAnother thing to check: in the tens place, from 401-488, '4' appears 10 times in the tens place (441-450). That's correct because 441 to 450 is 10 numbers, each with '4' in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, '8' in the tens place from 401-488 is only in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so '8' appears 8 times there.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, when considering 401-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, but only in 481-488. So, that's correct.\n\nAnother point to check: units place from 1-488. Since 488 is the last page, the units digits go up to 8 in the last partial block. So, units digits for '4' and '8' each appear once in that partial block, adding 1 to their counts.\n\nSo, all the counts seem accurate. Therefore, the total number of '4's is 188, and '8's is 97, so the difference is 91.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't miscount in the tens place. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except for the last one, which is 8 and appears only 8 times because we stop at 488.\n\nSo, '4' in the tens place is from 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, '8' in the tens place is from 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times. That's correct.\n\nSo, I think the calculations are accurate. Therefore, the answer should be 91 more '4's than '8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more '4's are printed than '8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total complete blocks of 10: 48 (pages 1-480), contributing 48 '4's and 48 '8's.\n   - Partial block (481-488): '4' at 484 and '8' at 488, adding 1 each.\n   - Total '4's in units: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total '8's in units: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Complete blocks of 100: 4 (pages 1-400), contributing 40 '4's and 40 '8's.\n   - Partial block (401-488):\n     - '4' appears 10 times (441-450).\n     - '8' appears 8 times (481-488).\n   - Total '4's in tens: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total '8's in tens: 40 + 8 = 48\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - '4' appears from 400-488: 89 times.\n   - '8' never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total '4's in hundreds: 89\n   - Total '8's in hundreds: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- '8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (total '4's) - 97 (total '8's) = 91\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488. Then, I'll do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the digits in each place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I remember that for problems like this, it's helpful to break down each digit position and calculate the occurrences of each digit in that position.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. Similarly, the digit 8 also appears once in the units place every 10 numbers.\n\nSo, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, there are 48 complete blocks, and then 8 extra numbers (from 481 to 488). \n\nWait, no, actually, when considering page numbers from 1 to 488, each block is 10 numbers, starting at 1-10, 11-20, and so on up to 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the last block is incomplete. Hmm, maybe a better way is to calculate how many full tens are there and then handle the remaining numbers.\n\nLet me think again. For the units digit, the number of 4's is equal to the number of complete tens times 1, plus any additional 4's in the remaining numbers. Similarly for 8's.\n\nSo, total number of units digits is 488. The number of complete tens is 48 (since 48*10=480), and then 8 more numbers from 481 to 488.\n\nIn each complete ten, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So for 48 complete tens, that's 48 times each.\n\nNow, for the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). So, adding these, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's: 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so 488 is the last page. So yes, units digits for 4 and 8 each have 49 occurrences.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers, with each digit from 0 to 9 appearing 10 times in the tens place. So, for example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, up to 9 for 90-99.\n\nBut in our case, we go up to 488, so we have four hundreds: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488.\n\nWait, actually, 488 is in the 400-499 range, but we only go up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 400-488, but the tens digit cycles as usual.\n\nLet me approach this systematically. For the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in each hundred. So, for each hundred, the number of times a digit appears in the tens place is 10.\n\nSo, for 1-99: tens digits go from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place, except for 0 which appears 9 times (since 1-9 have no tens digit). Wait, no, actually, in page numbers, 1 is considered as 01, but page numbers start at 1, so from 1-9, the tens digit is 0, but since we're only considering the printed digits, maybe page 1 is just '1', not '01'. Hmm, this complicates things.\n\nWait, in page numbering, page 1 is just '1', page 10 is '10', page 100 is '100', etc. So, when considering the tens digit, for numbers 1-9, the tens digit doesn't exist; it's effectively 0. So, for the tens place, in numbers 1-99, the digit 0 appears 9 times (for pages 1-9), and digits 1-9 each appear 10 times (for pages 10-19, 20-29, etc.).\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. From 1-9, the tens digit is 0, so 0 appears 9 times. Then, from 10-99, each tens digit from 1-9 appears 10 times (e.g., 10-19 have tens digit 1, appearing 10 times). So, in total, from 1-99, the tens digit 0 appears 9 times, and each digit 1-9 appears 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, in 100-199, the tens digit cycles again. From 100-109, tens digit is 0; 110-119, it's 1; up to 190-199, it's 9. So, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred.\n\nSame applies for 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. But wait, 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so the tens digits go from 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit from 0-8, how many times do they appear?\n\nFrom 400-409: tens digit 0, 10 times\n410-419: tens digit 1, 10 times\n...\n470-479: tens digit 7, 10 times\n480-488: tens digit 8, 9 times (since it's only 9 numbers: 480-488)\n\nSo, in 400-488, the tens digit 0 appears 10 times, 1-7 appear 10 times each, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place across all pages.\n\nFirst, let's handle each hundred:\n\n1-99:\n- Tens digit 0: 9 times\n- Tens digits 1-9: 10 times each\n\nSo, in 1-99, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (pages 40-49), and digit 8 appears 10 times (pages 80-89).\n\n100-199:\n- Each tens digit 0-9 appears 10 times\nSo, digit 4 appears 10 times (140-149), and digit 8 appears 10 times (180-189).\n\n200-299:\n- Similarly, digit 4 appears 10 times (240-249), and digit 8 appears 10 times (280-289).\n\n300-399:\n- Digit 4 appears 10 times (340-349), and digit 8 appears 10 times (380-389).\n\n400-488:\n- As calculated earlier, digit 4 in tens place: let's see, 400-409 is tens digit 0, 410-419 is 1, up to 440-449 is 4. So, digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (440-449). Then, 450-459 is 5, 460-469 is 6, 470-479 is 7, and 480-488 is 8, but only 9 times for 8.\n\nWait, but in 400-488, the tens digits go up to 8, but 440-449 is within this range. So, digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (440-449), and digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n\nSo, now, adding up all the tens digits:\n\nFor digit 4:\n- 1-99: 10\n- 100-199: 10\n- 200-299: 10\n- 300-399: 10\n- 400-488: 10\nTotal: 10*4 +10=50\n\nWait, no, 1-99:10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, and 400-488:10. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50.\n\nFor digit 8:\n- 1-99:10\n- 100-199:10\n- 200-299:10\n- 300-399:10\n- 400-488:9\nTotal: 10*4 +9=49\n\nSo, digit 4 appears 50 times in the tens place, and digit 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from 100 onwards.\n\nIn 1-99, there is no hundreds digit, so 0 appears 99 times, but we're only interested in 4 and 8.\n\nFrom 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so 1 appears 100 times, but we're looking for 4 and 8, so 0 times.\n\n200-299: hundreds digit is 2, so 0 times for 4 and 8.\n\n300-399: hundreds digit is 3, so 0 times.\n\n400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so digit 4 appears 89 times (from 400 to 488 inclusive). Wait, let me check: 488 - 400 +1 =89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers, so digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nDigit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is only 4 in this range. So, digit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, summarizing the hundreds place:\n\n- Digit 4: 89 times\n- Digit 8: 0 times\n\nNow, let's total up all the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each place.\n\nStarting with digit 4:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nDigit 8:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\n\nNow, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- Each complete ten contributes 1 to both 4 and 8. There are 48 complete tens (since 48*10=480), and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In these 8, 484 has a 4 and 488 has an 8. So, units place:48+1=49 for both.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For each hundred (except the last one), each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, from 1-399, each hundred contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place. That's 3 hundreds, so 3*10=30 for each digit. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit for 4 is 10 times (440-449), and for 8, it's 9 times (480-488). So, total tens place: 30+10=40 for 4, and 30+9=39 for 8. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 50 for 4 and 49 for 8. Hmm, seems like a discrepancy.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate the tens place.\n\nWait, from 1-99: tens digits for 4: 10 (40-49), for 8:10 (80-89).\n\n100-199: same, 10 each.\n\n200-299: same, 10 each.\n\n300-399: same, 10 each.\n\n400-488: for 4 in tens place, 440-449:10 times, and for 8, 480-488:9 times.\n\nSo, total for 4 in tens place:10+10+10+10+10=50? Wait, no, 1-99:10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:10 for 4. So that's 5*10=50. Similarly, for 8:1-99:10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nYes, so that's correct. So, tens place:50 for 4, 49 for 8.\n\nUnits place:49 each.\n\nHundreds place:89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was recounting, I thought maybe it was 40+10=50 for 4's tens place, but that was a miscalculation. It's actually 5 sets of 10, so 50.\n\nAnother way to check: the total number of digits printed is 488 pages. Each page number is a 1, 2, or 3-digit number. Let's calculate the total number of digits:\n\n- Pages 1-9:9 pages, 1 digit each:9 digits\n- Pages 10-99:90 pages, 2 digits each:180 digits\n- Pages 100-488:389 pages, 3 digits each:1167 digits\nTotal digits:9+180+1167=1356 digits.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98. So, total digits accounted for by 4 and 8 is 188+98=286, which is less than 1356, so that seems plausible.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't overcount. For example, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, which is correct because pages 400-488 are 89 pages, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, for 4, we have 50 times, which includes all the 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449.\n\nSame for 8's in the tens place: 49 times, which includes 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488, which is 9 times.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by considering how numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since 488 is a three-digit number, I'll need to account for all three places: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nI remember that to count the number of times a digit appears in each position, I can break it down by each digit place separately. So, I'll handle the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place one by one for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - In the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 10, 4 appears once (at 4). Similarly, from 11 to 20, it appears once at 14, and so on.\n   - To find out how many times 4 appears in the units place up to 488, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives me 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4. So, that's 48 times.\n   - But wait, the last group might not be complete. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning there's an extra 8 pages after the 48th group. Since 488 is the last page, the units digit cycles up to 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place in the 49th group. So, units place gives me 48 fours.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens place cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, from 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10 times, and so on.\n   - Let me calculate how many full hundreds are there in 488. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred (401-488).\n   - In each full hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so 4 full hundreds give me 4 * 10 = 40 fours in the tens place.\n   - Now, the partial hundred is 401-488. Here, the tens digit is 4 for 401-410, which is 10 numbers, so that's another 10 fours. So, total tens place fours are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, contributing 89 fours.\n\nNow, adding up all the fours:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal fours = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nWait, let me double-check that addition. 48 + 50 is 98, and 98 + 89 is 187. That seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the digit 8:\n\nI'll follow the same approach, breaking it down into units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4, the units digit cycles every 10. From 1-10, 8 appears once (at 8). This repeats every 10 numbers.\n   - 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8. That's 48 eights.\n   - The last partial group is 481-488, so the units digit goes from 1 to 8. 8 appears once here as well (at 488). So, units place eights are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Let's see how many full hundreds are there. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 full hundreds.\n   - In each full hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89 in the first hundred). So, 4 full hundreds give 4 * 10 = 40 eights.\n   - Now, the partial hundred is 401-488. The tens digit is 8 in 480-488. Let's see how many numbers that is. From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place.\n   - So, total tens place eights are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, hundreds place eights are 0.\n\nAdding up all the eights:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal eights = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 49 + 49 is 98, correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's.\n\nTotal fours = 187\nTotal eights = 98\nDifference = 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nHmm, that seems like a lot, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, when I calculated the units place for 4, I got 48, but for 8, I got 49. That makes sense because in the last partial group, 481-488, 8 appears once in the units place, whereas for 4, it doesn't appear there. So, that's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4, I had 50, and for 8, I had 49. Wait, why is that? Oh, because in the partial hundred for 4, the tens digit is 4 for 401-410, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 fours. But for 8 in the tens place, in the partial hundred, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, that's correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, that's correct.\n\nAdding up, fours: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\nEights: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nI think my calculations are right. So, the number of 4's printed is 89 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 89 more than the number of 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. There are 48 full decades (1-480), so 48 times. The last partial decade (481-488) doesn't include another 4, so total units: 48.\n   - **Tens Place:** Every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). There are 4 full centuries (1-400), contributing 40. The partial century (401-488) adds another 10 (401-410), total tens: 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times.\n   - **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** Every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. 48 full decades give 48. The last partial decade (481-488) adds one more, total units: 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** Every 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times. 4 full centuries give 40. The partial century (401-488) adds 9 (480-488), total tens: 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place up to 488, so 0.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should approach this by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and do the same for the digit 8, then find the difference between the two counts.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, in each set of 10 consecutive pages, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place, same with the digit 8. But I need to check if this pattern holds all the way up to 488.\n\nSo, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. That means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra pages. In each of those 48 sets, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So that's 48 times each. Now, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 8 appears once here, but the digit 4 doesn't appear in the units place in this last partial set because the units digits only go up to 8, and 4 isn't in 1-8. Wait, actually, 484 would have a 4 in the units place, but wait, 484 is within the 481-488 range. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, 488 is the last page, so the last page is 488, meaning the last 8 pages are 481 to 488. So, the units digits in this last partial set are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear once in this partial set. Therefore, in the units place, 4 appears 48 times (from the complete sets) plus 1 time (from the partial set), totaling 49 times. Similarly, 8 appears 48 times plus 1, totaling 49 times as well. Wait, but that can't be right because when I add the units place, both digits would have 49 occurrences. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me calculate the number of times 4 appears in the units place. For each ten pages, 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, how many tens are there? 480 divided by 10 is 48, so 48 times. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits go up to 8, so 484 would have a 4 in the units place, so that's one more. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, from 1 to 480, 48 times, and from 481 to 488, 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So total 8's in units place: 48 +1=49. So, in the units place, both digits appear 49 times. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 pages. So, for example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, up to 9 for 90-99. So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 pages.\n\nNow, the book has 488 pages, which is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, let's break it down:\n\nFor the tens place, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for each digit, that's 4*10=40 times.\n\nNow, from 401 to 488, which is 88 pages, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, in the tens place, each digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for 8, which appears only 9 times because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 pages, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 9 pages. So, for the tens digit in 401-488:\n\n- 0: 10 times (401-410)\n- 1: 10 times (411-420)\n- 2: 10 times (421-430)\n- 3: 10 times (431-440)\n- 4: 10 times (441-450)\n- 5: 10 times (451-460)\n- 6: 10 times (461-470)\n- 7: 10 times (471-480)\n- 8: 9 times (481-488, which is 8 pages, but wait, 480-489 is 10 pages, so 480-488 is 9 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages.\n\nWait, but 480 is included in 401-488, so from 480-488, that's 9 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages. So, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears 9 times in this last partial hundred.\n\nSo, total times 8 appears in the tens place: 4 complete hundreds *10=40, plus 9 in the last partial hundred, so 40+9=49.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 4 in the tens place: in the complete hundreds, it's 4*10=40, and in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 pages. So, that's 10 times. So total 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50.\n\nWait, that can't be right because from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so yes, 10 times. So total for 4 in tens place is 50.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times. So, the difference here is 50-49=1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place?\n\n- 1: 100 times (100-199)\n- 2: 100 times (200-299)\n- 3: 100 times (300-399)\n- 4: 89 times (400-488, which is 89 pages because 488-400+1=89)\n\nWait, 400-488 is 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, the difference here is 89-0=89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFor digit 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 +89= 188\n\nFor digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 +49 +0=98\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because 49+50+89 is indeed 188, and 49+49 is 98, so 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought in the units place, both digits appeared 49 times, so that's equal, but in the tens place, 4's were 50 and 8's were 49, so that's +1, and in the hundreds place, 4's were 89 and 8's were 0, so that's +89. So total difference is 1+89=90. So yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89 pages. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, for the digit 4, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so that's 10 times. So, 40 (from complete hundreds) +10=50.\n\nFor the digit 8 in the tens place, in the last partial hundred, it's 9 times because 481-488 is 8 pages, but wait, 480 is included in the 401-488 range. Wait, 480 is part of 401-488, so from 480-488, that's 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages. So, 40 (from complete hundreds) +9=49.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the total counts are as I calculated before.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 complete sets (480 pages) + 8 extra pages (481-488).\n   - 4 appears once in each set: 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n   - 8 appears once in each set: 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Complete hundreds (1-400): 4 sets, each contributing 10 times.\n     - 4: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 times.\n     - 8: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 times.\n   - Partial hundred (401-488):\n     - 4 appears in 441-450: 10 times.\n     - 8 appears in 481-488: 9 times.\n   - Total:\n     - 4: 40 + 10 = 50 times.\n     - 8: 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears from 400-488: 89 times.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should understand how page numbers are structured. Each page number is a three-digit number, right? Well, actually, from 1 to 9, they're single digits, from 10 to 99 they're two digits, and from 100 onwards, they're three digits. But since the book only goes up to 488, the maximum page number is 488, which is a three-digit number.\n\nSo, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times 8 appears, then find the difference between these two counts.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the problem into smaller parts. I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. For each place, I'll calculate how many 4's and 8's appear and then sum them up across all places.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the units digit will be 4 exactly once and 8 exactly once. \n\nBut I need to check how many complete blocks of 10 there are in 488 pages. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 pages (481-488). \n\nIn each complete block, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 blocks, that's 48 times 1, which is 48 4's and 48 8's.\n\nNow, the partial block from 481-488. The units digits here are 1 through 8. So, in this partial block, the units digit is 4 once (page 484) and 8 once (page 488). So, adding one more 4 and one more 8.\n\nSo, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\nTotal units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\nWait, that seems like they're equal here. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake because I thought there might be more 4's. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, in the partial block, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 occurs once (484) and 8 occurs once (488). So, that's correct. So, units place contributes 49 each.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nThe tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 ten times (40-49) and 8 ten times (80-89).\n\nBut since the book goes up to 488, let's see how many hundreds we have. We have 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nSo, for each hundred, except the last one, the tens digit cycles completely. Let's calculate:\n\n1. For 0-99: Tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (40-49), and 8 occurs 10 times (80-89).\n2. For 100-199: Similarly, tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (140-149), and 8 occurs 10 times (180-189).\n3. For 200-299: Tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (240-249), and 8 occurs 10 times (280-289).\n4. For 300-399: Tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (340-349), and 8 occurs 10 times (380-389).\n5. For 400-488: Now, this is a partial hundred. The tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, let's check how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nIn 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so from 480-488, the tens digit is 8, which is 9 pages (480-488, inclusive). Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 pages, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 pages. So, the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times in 480-488.\n\nWait, but in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 times, and the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 times.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- 0-99: 10 4's and 10 8's\n- 100-199: 10 4's and 10 8's\n- 200-299: 10 4's and 10 8's\n- 300-399: 10 4's and 10 8's\n- 400-488: 10 4's and 9 8's\n\nNow, adding these up:\n\nTotal 4's in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50\nTotal 8's in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49\n\nWait, so in the tens place, 4's occur 50 times and 8's occur 49 times. That's interesting, so 4's are more by one in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me double-check the last part. In 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so that's correct. The tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 pages because 488 is the last page. So, yes, 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place: 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nThe hundreds digit is 1 in 100-199, 2 in 200-299, 3 in 300-399, and 4 in 400-488. So, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place.\n\n- 100-199: Hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's.\n- 200-299: Hundreds digit is 2, so no 4's or 8's.\n- 300-399: Hundreds digit is 3, so no 4's or 8's.\n- 400-488: Hundreds digit is 4, so 4 appears 89 times (from 400 to 488 inclusive, which is 89 pages). Wait, is that right?\n\nWait, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8.\n\nSo, hundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's and 8's across units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nFirst, 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = Let's calculate: 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems off because in the hundreds place, 4's are 89, which is a significant number. So, total 4's are 188, and 8's are 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check each part because I might have made a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place: 488 pages, so 48 full tens and a partial of 8 pages. Each full ten contributes one 4 and one 8. So, 48 each, plus in the partial, 484 and 488, so one each. So, 49 each. That's correct.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens digit. There are four full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), so 4 x 10 = 40 each. Then, in 400-488, tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (440-449), and 8 occurs 9 times (480-488). So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, so 89 pages, each with hundreds digit 4, so 89 4's. 8's in hundreds place: 0. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there any other place where 8's might appear more? For example, in the hundreds place, 4's are appearing a lot because the book goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, which is a significant number. That's why 4's are way more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check another way. Let me try to count all the 4's and 8's again.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full tens, each contributes one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial ten (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Tens place: For each hundred, 10 times. There are four full hundreds, so 4 x 10 = 40. Then, in 400-488, tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 times. So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nCounting 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full tens, each contributes one 8, so 48. In the last partial ten, 488, so units digit 8 appears once. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Tens place: For each hundred, 10 times. Four full hundreds, so 4 x 10 = 40. In 400-488, tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 numbers, each with hundreds digit 4, so 89 4's. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. And the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's correct.\n\nIn the units place, each ten contributes one 4 and one 8, except the last partial ten, which contributes one of each.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct, and the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Break Down the Problem:**\n   - We'll analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately to count occurrences of '4' and '8'.\n\n2. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 pages (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) has exactly one '4' and one '8' in the units place.\n   - Total complete blocks in 488 pages: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8).\n   - Each block contributes 1 '4' and 1 '8', so 48 each.\n   - Partial block (481-488) has units digits 1-8, contributing 1 '4' (484) and 1 '8' (488).\n   - **Total '4's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Total '8's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n3. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred (e.g., 0-99, 100-199) has 10 occurrences of '4' and '8' in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 80-89).\n   - There are four full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), contributing 10 '4's and 10 '8's each.\n   - **From full hundreds:** 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 '4's and 40 '8's.\n   - In the partial hundred (400-488):\n     - '4' in tens place: 10 times (440-449).\n     - '8' in tens place: 9 times (480-488).\n   - **Total '4's in tens place:** 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - **Total '8's in tens place:** 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n4. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is '4' only in the range 400-488, which spans 89 pages.\n   - **'4's in hundreds place:** 89.\n   - **'8's in hundreds place:** 0.\n\n5. **Total Counts:**\n   - **Total '4's:** Units (49) + Tens (50) + Hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n   - **Total '8's:** Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n6. **Difference:**\n   - More '4's than '8's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should consider each digit place separately\u2014like the units place and the tens place\u2014since page numbers can have one, two, or three digits. But wait, since the book has 488 pages, all page numbers are either one, two, or three digits. Wait, actually, page 1 is just 1, page 10 is 10, and so on up to 488. So, the page numbers range from 1 to 488, which is a three-digit number, but not all pages are three digits. Hmm, maybe it's easier to think of all page numbers as three digits, padding with leading zeros, but I'm not sure if that's necessary. Maybe it's better to handle each place separately without padding.\n\nSo, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to get the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in each set of ten consecutive numbers. For example, from 1 to 10, the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, each digit appears once every ten numbers. So, in the units place, how many times does 4 appear? Similarly for 8.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears ten times in a hundred numbers. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in the tens place, each digit appears 10 times per hundred.\n\nNow, since the book has 488 pages, let's see how many hundreds that is. 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, I can break down the counting into hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to handle each digit place separately for the entire range from 1 to 488.\n\nLet me start with the units place.\n\nUnits place:\n\nThe units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in the units place. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Then, in the incomplete block, which is 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial block, does 4 appear? Yes, at 484, so that's one more 4. Does 8 appear? Yes, at 488, so that's one more 8.\n\nSo, total number of 4's in units place: 48 complete blocks \u00d7 1 = 48, plus 1 from the partial block, totaling 49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in units place: 48 complete blocks \u00d71 =48, plus 1 from the partial block, totaling 49.\n\nWait, but that seems odd because 488 is the last page, so the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included. So, yes, both 4 and 8 appear once more in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nTens place:\n\nThe tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for example, from 0-99, the tens digits go 0 (10 times), 1 (10 times), ..., 9 (10 times). So, each digit appears 10 times per hundred.\n\nNow, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nSo, in each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49 in the first hundred, 140-149 in the second, etc.), same for 8: 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n\nSo, for each complete hundred, the number of 4's in tens place is 10, and same for 8's.\n\nThere are 4 complete hundreds, so 4 \u00d710 =40 for 4's, and 4 \u00d710=40 for 8's.\n\nNow, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but wait, 488 is the last page, so it's up to 488, which is 48 in the tens place? Wait, no, 401-488 is actually 88 pages, which is 8 full tens (0-8) and 8 units. Wait, no, 401-488 is 88 pages, which is 8 full tens (401-410, 411-420,...,481-490, but 488 is the last, so 481-488 is only 8 pages, not a full ten.\n\nWait, maybe a better way is to consider the tens digit from 401 to 488.\n\nSo, the tens digits in 401-488:\n\nFrom 401-410: tens digit is 0 (10 times)\n411-420: tens digit 1 (10 times)\n421-430: tens digit 2 (10 times)\n431-440: tens digit 3 (10 times)\n441-450: tens digit 4 (10 times)\n451-460: tens digit 5 (10 times)\n461-470: tens digit 6 (10 times)\n471-480: tens digit 7 (10 times)\n481-490: tens digit 8 (10 times)\nBut wait, the book ends at 488, so 481-488 is only 8 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 pages.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 times. The digit 8 appears in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 times.\n\nWait, no, 481-490 is 10 pages, but since we only go up to 488, that's 8 pages. So, the digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place in the incomplete hundred.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 481 to 488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for each of those, so 8 times.\n\nSo, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the number of 4's in the tens place is 10 (from 441-450), and the number of 8's is 8 (from 481-488).\n\nSo, total for tens place:\n\n4's: 4 complete hundreds \u00d710 =40, plus 10 in the incomplete hundred, so total 50.\n\n8's: 4 complete hundreds \u00d710=40, plus 8 in the incomplete hundred, so total 48.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because in the incomplete hundred, the 8's in the tens place are only 8, not 10. So, 40 +8=48 for 8's, and 40 +10=50 for 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nThe hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488.\n\nWait, but actually, page numbers start at 1, so the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nWait, but page numbers don't have leading zeros, so pages 1-99 are one or two digits, so the hundreds digit is 0, but we don't print leading zeros, so the hundreds digit only appears when the page number is three digits, i.e., 100 and above.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n\nSimilarly, the digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, number of 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\nNumber of 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, now, let's sum up all the digits:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89= 188.\n\nWait, let me check that addition: 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:48\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49 +48=97.\n\nWait, 49+48=97.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -97=91.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check each step.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\nWe have 488 pages. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48+1=49 for 4's, and 48+1=49 for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach complete hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so 4\u00d710=40 for each. Now, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 441-450 (10 times) and 8 in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, that's 8 times. So, 4's in tens place: 40+10=50, 8's:40+8=48. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 pages (488-400+1=89). So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. 8's in hundreds place: 0, since the book doesn't go beyond 488. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nWait, but I feel like that's a lot. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, in the incomplete hundred, 441-450 is 10 pages, so 10 4's. 481-488 is 8 pages, so 8 8's. Correct.\n\nIn the units place, 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8, plus the partial block contributing one 4 and one 8. So, 49 each. Correct.\n\nSo, the total 4's are 49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+48=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 91.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I know that each page from 1 to 488 is numbered once. So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering how digits are structured in numbers. Page numbers can be one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit numbers. Since 488 is a three-digit number, I should break down the counting based on the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\nI'll handle each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both 4 and 8 and sum up their occurrences.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:** The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, there are 488 / 10 = 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups and a partial group from 481 to 488. In that partial group, 484 has a 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages in the 401-488 range. In each full hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear here? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 occurrences. However, wait, 488 is included, so 488 is 488, which is still in the 400-499 range, but our book ends at 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So, 89 occurrences.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nWait, hold on, that seems high. Let me double-check the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the digit 8:\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and then in the partial group (481-488), 488 is the last number, which has an 8 in the units place. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, in 488 pages, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book ends at 488, which is less than 800. So, the hundreds digit never is 8 in this case. Therefore, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98. To find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract 98 from 188: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a big difference. Let me verify each step again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 48 full groups (1-480), each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, 484 is the next 4 in units place, so 49 total. Correct.\n\n- Tens: Each hundred block has 10 4's in the tens place. 4 blocks (1-400) contribute 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 50 total. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 48 full groups, 48 eights, plus 488, which is one more, so 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens: Each hundred block has 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 blocks give 40. In 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds: None, as 800 is beyond 488. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full groups of 10 (480 numbers) give 48 occurrences. The last group (481-488) adds 1 more, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 full hundreds contribute 10 each (40). The last partial hundred (401-488) adds 10 more, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 numbers (400-488) contribute 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full groups give 48, plus 1 in 488, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 full hundreds contribute 40, and the last partial hundred adds 9, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I should understand the problem clearly. Each page from 1 to 488 is printed once, and I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nAlright, let's start by considering how digits are structured in page numbers. Page numbers can be 1-digit, 2-digit, or 3-digit numbers. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488, which is a 3-digit number. So, I'll need to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nI think the best approach is to count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately and then sum them up. Let me outline the steps:\n\n1. **Count the number of 4's in the units place.**\n2. **Count the number of 4's in the tens place.**\n3. **Count the number of 4's in the hundreds place.**\n4. **Do the same for the digit 8: count in units, tens, and hundreds places.**\n5. **Sum up all the 4's and all the 8's.**\n6. **Subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to get the difference.**\n\nOkay, let's start with the digit 4.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n\n**Units Place:**\nIn the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 10, the digit 4 appears once (at page 4). From 11 to 20, it appears once (at page 14), and so on. So, in each block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and an additional 8 pages. In each complete block, we have 1 occurrence of 4 in the units place. So, that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (at 484). So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that again. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, number of complete cycles is 488 // 10 = 48, with a remainder of 8. So, in each cycle, 1 four in units place, so 48 fours. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once more. So total 48 +1 =49. That seems correct.\n\n**Tens Place:**\nNow, moving to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for numbers 40-49, which is 10 occurrences. Similarly, from 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10, and so on.\n\nSo, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so 4 hundreds give 4*10=40 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 in the range 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 fours. So, total fours in tens place are 40 +10=50.\n\nWait, but wait. From 401 to 488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, etc., up to 8 for 481-490. But since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit 8 only goes up to 488. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So, yes, 40 +10=50.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400-499. But since our book only goes up to 488, it's from 400-488.\n\nSo, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 =89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400 is the first, 401, 402,... up to 488. So, yes, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's total up all the fours:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\n\nTotal fours = 49 +50 +89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 49 +50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Okay, so total fours are 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n\n**Units Place:**\nSimilar to fours, in the units place, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nNumber of complete blocks of 10 is 48 (since 488//10=48), each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once more at 488. So, total 48 +1=49 eights in the units place.\n\nWait, but wait: 488 is included, so in the last partial block, the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once at 488. So yes, 49 eights in units place.\n\n**Tens Place:**\nNow, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, in each block of 100, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8.\n\nNumber of complete hundreds in 488 is 4 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 eights, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...488). So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers here. So, that's 9 eights.\n\nWait, but wait: from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nSo, total eights in tens place: 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, let me confirm: 40 from the complete hundreds, and 9 from the partial hundred. So, 49.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\nNow, the hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nSo, total eights:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\n\nTotal eights=49+49=98.\n\nWait, that's 49+49=98. Hmm, let me check again.\n\nWait, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds. So, 98 eights in total.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. From 1-400, in each hundred, 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 40+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is the hundreds place correct? From 1-488, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, yes, 0 eights there.\n\nNow, let me confirm the counts again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal fours:49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nSo, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check if I did everything correctly.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Let me check that again.\n\nIn the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for fours, from 1-400, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, 40+10=50. That seems correct.\n\nIn the units place, 4 appears once every 10 numbers, so 488//10=48 full cycles, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in the last partial cycle (481-488), 4 appears once, so 49. Correct.\n\nFor eights:\n\nUnits place: same logic, 48 full cycles, 48 eights, plus one more at 488, so 49.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 eights, so 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights, totaling 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0, correct.\n\nSo, total fours:188, eights:98, difference:90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit surprised that the difference is 90. Let me see if that makes sense.\n\nWait, 4 appears more often because in the hundreds place, 4 appears a lot (89 times), whereas 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, that's a significant difference. Let me see:\n\nFours have 89 in hundreds, while eights have 0 there. So, that's already 89 more fours than eights. Then, in the tens and units, fours and eights are both appearing around 50 and 49 times, so the fours are slightly more there as well. So, the total difference is 90, which seems plausible.\n\nWait, let me recalculate the totals just to be sure.\n\nFours:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nEights:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer is that there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 complete blocks of 10, contributing 48 fours. In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 4 appears once. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block of 100 contributes 10 fours. With 4 complete hundreds, that's 40 fours. In 401-488, 440-449 adds 10 more. Total: 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Total: 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. 48 complete blocks give 48 eights. In the last 8 numbers, 8 appears once. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block of 100 contributes 10 eights. 4 complete hundreds give 40. In 401-488, 480-488 adds 9 eights. Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 8 never appears as the hundreds digit in 1-488. Total: 0.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - More 4's than 8's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 90 more times than the digit 8.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I should probably understand what the question is asking. It's about counting the number of times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488 and then subtracting the number of times the digit 8 appears. The result will tell me how many more 4's there are than 8's. \n\nAlright, so to approach this, I think I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That way, I can calculate how many times each digit appears in each place and then sum them up for all places.\n\nLet's start by considering each place one by one.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, from 1 to 10, the digits in the units place are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, the digit 4 appears once in every 10 pages, and the same goes for 8.\n   - Since the book has 488 pages, the number of complete groups of 10 is 48 (because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups). In each group, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So, for the units place, the count is 48 for both 4 and 8.\n   - But wait, there's a remainder of 8 pages after the 48 complete groups (since 48*10=480, and 488-480=8). So, in these last 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial group, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, adding these, the units place contributes 48 +1 =49 for 4 and 48 +1=49 for 8. Hmm, wait, but that might not be correct because 488 is included, so let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. The total number of units digits from 1 to 488 is 488 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in the units place, except maybe the last incomplete group. But since 488 is a multiple of 10 plus 8, the units digits from 1 to 488 will have 48 complete cycles of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8, and then the last 8 numbers (481-488) contributing one 4 and one 8. So, total for units place: 48*1 +1 =49 for 4 and same for 8. So, 49 each.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Now, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 pages.\n   - So, in 488 pages, how many complete hundreds do we have? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for each hundred, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 for 4 and 40 for 8.\n   - Now, beyond 400, we have 88 more pages (401-488). Let's look at the tens digit here. From 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, it's 1; 421-430, it's 2; 431-440, it's 3; 441-450, it's 4; 451-460, it's 5; 461-470, it's 6; 471-480, it's 7; and 481-488, it's 8.\n   - So, in the tens place from 401-488, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears, but we need to check how many times each appears.\n   - From 401-488, each tens group (like 410-419, but actually from 401-410, it's 10 numbers, but the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, right? Wait, no, 401-410: the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, but 411-420 is tens digit 1, etc. So each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears exactly 10 times, except maybe the last one if it's cut short. Wait, 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8, but only 8 numbers instead of 10. So, in the tens place, digit 8 appears 8 times instead of 10 in this last partial group.\n   - So, for the tens place beyond 400, the digits 0-8 each appear 10 times except for 8, which appears 8 times. So, for digit 4 in the tens place, it's 10 times (from 441-450). For digit 8, it's 10 times from 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 times. So, in the tens place beyond 400, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n   - So, total in the tens place: from the first 400 pages, 4*10=40 for 4 and 40 for 8. From 401-488, 10 for 4 and 8 for 8. So, total tens place: 40+10=50 for 4 and 40+8=48 for 8.\n\nWait, let me verify that again. From 1-400, each digit in the tens place appears 40 times (4*10). Then from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except 8, which appears 8 times. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place from 401-488, and 8 appears 8 times. So, total for tens place: 40+10=50 for 4, and 40+8=48 for 8.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Now, the hundreds place. From 1-99, there's no hundreds digit. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4.\n   - So, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place? \n   - Digit 1 appears 100 times (100-199).\n   - Digit 2 appears 100 times (200-299).\n   - Digit 3 appears 100 times (300-399).\n   - Digit 4 appears 89 times (400-488, which is 89 numbers, since 488-400+1=89). Wait, is that correct? Let me check: from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers.\n   - So, in the hundreds place, digit 4 appears 89 times, and digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488, and 1,2,3 before that. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - Now, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n   - For digit 4:\n     - Units place: 49\n     - Tens place: 50\n     - Hundreds place: 89\n     - Total: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n   - For digit 8:\n     - Units place: 49\n     - Tens place: 48\n     - Hundreds place: 0\n     - Total: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - Now, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\n- Units place: 48 full groups of 10, each contributing 1 four and 1 eight. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So, units place: 48+1=49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\n- Tens place: From 1-400, each digit appears 40 times in the tens place. Then from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except 8, which appears 8 times because 481-488 is only 8 numbers. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 8 times. So, total tens place for 4: 40+10=50, and for 8: 40+8=48. That seems correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, and 8 doesn't appear at all. So, 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nAdding up: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188 for 4.\n\nFor 8: 49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nSo, 188 - 97 = 91. So, there are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them. So, 89 times. That's correct.\n\nAnother way to check: total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 97. The difference is 91. That seems correct.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place for the first 480 pages.\n   - Pages 481-488 add one more 4 and one more 8.\n   - Total: 49 for both 4 and 8.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 40 times in the tens place for the first 400 pages.\n   - Pages 401-488 add 10 times for 4 and 8 times for 8.\n   - Total: 50 for 4 and 48 for 8.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nSumming up:\n- Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- Total 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 91.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

Then, I need to find the difference between the number of 4's and 8's. \n\nLet me start by considering how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 up to 488. So, the first few pages are 1, 2, 3, ..., 9, then 10, 11, and so on up to 488.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Then, I can sum them up for each digit and find the difference.\n\nLet me break it down by each digit position.\n\n**Units Place:**\n\nStarting with the units place. For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of 10, the digit '4' appears once and the digit '8' appears once. \n\nTo find out how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488 pages, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives me 48 groups with a remainder of 8. That means there are 48 complete groups where each digit (4 and 8) appears 48 times each in the units place. \n\nBut wait, I have an extra 8 pages beyond the 480th page. So, pages 481 to 488. Let me check the units digits in this partial group. The units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial group, the digit '4' appears once (page 484), and the digit '8' appears once (page 488). \n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 48 (from complete groups) + 1 (from partial group) = 49.\nTotal 8's in units place: 48 (from complete groups) + 1 (from partial group) = 49.\n\nWait, that seems the same. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the units place, each complete group of 10 contributes one 4 and one 8. So, 48 complete groups would have 48 4's and 48 8's. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, '4' appears once (484) and '8' appears once (488). So, total 4's in units: 48 +1=49, and 8's:48+1=49. So, same number. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check that again. Let me confirm by considering the units digits from 1 to 488. Each digit 0-9 appears equally in the units place, except maybe for the last partial group. Wait, but 488 is a multiple of 10 plus 8, so the last group is 481-488, which has 8 numbers. So, units digits from 1 to 8. So, '4' appears once, and '8' appears once. So, yes, 49 each. So, units place contributes 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\n**Tens Place:**\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Similarly, from 101-200, it's the same pattern, and so on.\n\nIn each hundred, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is '4' for 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, '8' appears in the tens place for 80-89, which is 10 times.\n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each of these 4 full hundreds, the digit '4' appears 10 times in the tens place, and '8' appears 10 times as well. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10=40 4's and 4*10=40 8's.\n\nNow, let's look at the last partial hundred, which is 401-488. The tens digits here range from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 480-488). Wait, actually, 401-488 is 88 pages, so the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). \n\nWait, let me clarify: From 401 to 488, the tens digits go as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nSo, in the tens place, the digit '4' appears in 441-450, which is 10 times. Similarly, '8' appears in 481-488, which is 8 times (since 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is '8' for 8 numbers). \n\nWait, but 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is '8' for all of them, but since each tens digit group has 10 numbers, but here we only have 8, so the '8' in the tens place occurs 8 times. Wait, but in the tens place, each occurrence is for a full 10 numbers, but in this case, we only have 8, so maybe the '8' in the tens place occurs only 8 times? Hmm, that might be correct.\n\nWait, let me think again. For the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in each hundred. But in the last partial hundred, from 401-488, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place?\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0, 10 times\n- 411-420: tens digit 1, 10 times\n- 421-430: tens digit 2, 10 times\n- 431-440: tens digit 3, 10 times\n- 441-450: tens digit 4, 10 times\n- 451-460: tens digit 5, 10 times\n- 461-470: tens digit 6, 10 times\n- 471-480: tens digit 7, 10 times\n- 481-488: tens digit 8, 8 times (since 488 - 481 +1 = 8)\n\nSo, in the tens place, for the last partial hundred, '4' appears 10 times (441-450) and '8' appears 8 times (481-488).\n\nSo, total in the tens place:\n\n- '4's: 4 hundreds * 10 each = 40, plus 10 from the last partial hundred, so 40 +10=50\n- '8's: 4 hundreds *10 each=40, plus 8 from the last partial hundred, so 40 +8=48\n\nSo, in the tens place, '4' appears 50 times, '8' appears 48 times. So, the difference here is 50 -48=2 more '4's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 '4's and 10 '8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40 each. Then, from 401-488, '4's in the tens place occur in 441-450, which is 10 times, and '8's occur in 481-488, which is 8 times. So, yes, that's correct. So, total '4's:40+10=50, '8's:40+8=48. So, 50-48=2 more '4's in the tens place.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers from 100 to 488. \n\nIn the hundreds place, the digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, since the book goes up to 488.\n\nLet's see how many times each digit appears in the hundreds place.\n\n- Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (not printed, as page numbers are 1-99, so no hundreds digit)\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so '1' appears 100 times\n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, so '2' appears 100 times\n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, so '3' appears 100 times\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so '4' appears 89 times (since 488-400+1=89 pages)\n\nWait, 400-488 is 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is '4' for all these pages, so '4' appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, for '8's in the hundreds place: since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches '8'. So, '8' appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, '4's:89, '8's:0. So, difference here is 89-0=89 more '4's.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Pages 400-488 are 89 pages (including both 400 and 488). So, the hundreds digit is '4' for all of these, so yes, 89 times. So, '4's in hundreds place:89, '8's:0.\n\n**Total Count:**\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each digit place.\n\nFor '4's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal '4's:49 +50 +89= 188\n\nFor '8's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:48\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal '8's:49 +48 +0=97\n\nNow, the difference between '4's and '8's is 188 -97=91.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 49 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\nIn the tens place, '4's:50, '8's:48.\n\nIn the hundreds place, '4's:89, '8's:0.\n\nSo, '4's total:49+50+89=188\n\n'8's total:49+48+0=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is '4' 89 times. So, that's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, from 401-488, '4's in tens place:10 times (441-450), and '8's:8 times (481-488). So, that's correct.\n\nUnits place:49 each, so that's correct.\n\nSo, the total number of '4's is 188, '8's is 97, so 188-97=91.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place. Pages 400-488: 488-400+1=89 pages. So, hundreds digit is '4' 89 times. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, another way to check: total number of '4's should be more than '8's, which it is, 188 vs 97, so 91 more '4's.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. From 1-488, how many times does '4' appear in the tens place?\n\nIn each hundred, '4' appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) would have 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, '4' appears in the tens place for 10 more times (441-450). So, total 50.\n\nSimilarly, '8' in the tens place: each hundred has 10 '8's, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, '8' appears in the tens place for 8 times (481-488). So, total 48.\n\nUnits place: each hundred has 10 '4's and 10 '8's, so 4*10=40 each, plus in the last 88 pages, '4' appears once and '8' appears once, so total 49 each.\n\nHundreds place: '4' appears 89 times, '8' appears 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up, yes, 49+50+89=188 for '4's, and 49+48+0=97 for '8's.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-97=91.\n\nWait, but I feel like 91 is a bit high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, another approach: count all '4's and '8's in each position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a formula or a more systematic approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the method of counting digit occurrences by position.\n\nFor each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate how many times '4' and '8' appear.\n\nLet me formalize this.\n\n**Units Digit:**\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: floor(488/10)=48, remainder 8.\n\nEach complete group contributes 1 '4' and 1 '8' in the units place.\n\nSo, '4's:48, '8's:48.\n\nRemainder:8, so in the last partial group (481-488), units digits are 1-8.\n\nSo, '4' appears once (484), '8' appears once (488).\n\nTotal '4's in units:48+1=49.\n\nTotal '8's in units:48+1=49.\n\n**Tens Digit:**\n\nNumber of complete groups of 100: floor(488/100)=4, remainder 88.\n\nEach complete group contributes 10 '4's and 10 '8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, '4's:4*10=40.\n\n'8's:4*10=40.\n\nNow, the remainder is 88, so we have 88 numbers beyond 400.\n\nIn the tens place for these 88 numbers (401-488):\n\nWe can think of it as 0-8 in the tens digit (since 401-488 is 88 numbers, which is 8 full tens groups (each 10 numbers) plus 8 extra numbers).\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to consider how many times each digit appears in the tens place in 401-488.\n\nAs I did before, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). \n\nFor each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear?\n\n- Tens digit 0: 401-410: 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 1:411-420:10\n- Tens digit 2:421-430:10\n- Tens digit 3:431-440:10\n- Tens digit 4:441-450:10\n- Tens digit 5:451-460:10\n- Tens digit 6:461-470:10\n- Tens digit 7:471-480:10\n- Tens digit 8:481-488:8 numbers\n\nSo, in the tens place, '4' appears 10 times (tens digit 4), and '8' appears 8 times (tens digit 8).\n\nSo, total '4's in tens place:40 (from complete hundreds) +10=50.\n\nTotal '8's in tens place:40 (from complete hundreds)+8=48.\n\n**Hundreds Digit:**\n\nNumber of complete groups of 1000: not applicable here since we're only going up to 488.\n\nBut, the hundreds digit is non-zero from page 100 onwards.\n\nFrom 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, not printed.\n\nFrom 100-199: hundreds digit is '1', so '1' appears 100 times.\n\nFrom 200-299: '2' appears 100 times.\n\nFrom 300-399: '3' appears 100 times.\n\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit is '4', and there are 89 pages (488-400+1=89).\n\nSo, '4's in hundreds place:89.\n\n'8's in hundreds place:0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n\nAdding up:\n\n'4's: Units (49) + Tens (50) + Hundreds (89) = 49+50+89=188.\n\n'8's: Units (49) + Tens (48) + Hundreds (0)=49+48=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nWait, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can count the number of '4's and '8's in each position again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for digit counting.\n\nIn general, the number of times a digit d appears in position k (units, tens, hundreds) in numbers from 1 to n can be calculated using a formula, but perhaps it's easier to do it manually here.\n\nWait, but maybe I can check using another approach.\n\nWait, let me consider the number of '4's and '8's in each position again.\n\nUnits place:\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears equally in the units place, except possibly the last partial group.\n\nTotal numbers:488.\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10:48, each contributing 1 '4' and 1 '8'.\n\nRemaining numbers:8, which are 481-488. Their units digits are 1-8, so '4' appears once, '8' appears once.\n\nSo, units place: '4's=48+1=49, '8's=48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred contributes 10 '4's and 10 '8's in the tens place.\n\nNumber of complete hundreds:4, so '4's=4*10=40, '8's=4*10=40.\n\nRemaining numbers:88 (401-488).\n\nIn these 88 numbers, the tens digits go from 0 to 8.\n\nFor each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear?\n\n- Tens digit 0:10 times (401-410)\n- Tens digit 1:10 (411-420)\n- Tens digit 2:10 (421-430)\n- Tens digit 3:10 (431-440)\n- Tens digit 4:10 (441-450)\n- Tens digit 5:10 (451-460)\n- Tens digit 6:10 (461-470)\n- Tens digit 7:10 (471-480)\n- Tens digit 8:8 times (481-488)\n\nSo, '4's in tens place:10 (from tens digit 4)\n'8's in tens place:8 (from tens digit 8)\n\nThus, total '4's in tens place:40+10=50\n'8's in tens place:40+8=48\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, not printed.\nFrom 100-199: '1' appears 100 times\nFrom 200-299: '2' appears 100 times\nFrom 300-399: '3' appears 100 times\nFrom 400-488: '4' appears 89 times\n\nSo, '4's in hundreds place:89\n'8's in hundreds place:0\n\nTotal '4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\nTotal '8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again: in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 pages, so '4' appears 89 times. That makes sense.\n\nIn the tens place, '4' appears 10 times in the last partial hundred, so 50 in total, and '8' appears 8 times, so 48 in total.\n\nUnits place:49 each.\n\nSo, the difference is 91.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{91}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in each digit position (units, tens, and hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each group of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n- There are 48 complete groups of 10, contributing 48 4's and 48 8's.\n- The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) contribute one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n- Total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n- Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's.\n- There are 4 complete hundreds, contributing 40 4's and 40 8's.\n- The remaining 88 numbers (401-488) contribute 10 4's (441-450) and 8 8's (481-488).\n- Total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n- Total 8's in tens place: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- From 1-99, hundreds digit is 0.\n- From 100-399, hundreds digits are 1, 2, 3, each appearing 100 times.\n- From 400-488, hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times.\n- Total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n- Total 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- Total 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n**Difference:**\n- The difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nThus, the number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{91}."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. The problem is about counting the occurrences of the digit '4' and '8' in all the page numbers from 1 to 488. Then, I have to find the difference between these two counts. That is, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to get how many more 4's there are.\n\nAlright, let's start by thinking about how numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 up to 488. So, the numbers will range from 1 to 999, but since it's only 488 pages, it stops at 488.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. For each place, I'll calculate how many times '4' appears and how many times '8' appears, then sum them up across all places.\n\nLet me break it down by each digit position.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every group of ten numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times a specific digit appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then adjusting for any remainder.\n\nWait, but 488 isn't a multiple of 10. So, I need to handle the last partial group separately.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of times '4' appears in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have '4' in the units place?\n\nWell, every 10 numbers, there's exactly one '4' in the units place. So, the number of '4's in the units place is the number of complete tens in 488, which is 48 (since 48*10=480), plus one more '4' in the units place in 481 to 488, which is 484. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 '4's in the units place.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1 to 480, each ten has one '4', so that's 48 '4's. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so '4' appears once more at 484. So, total '4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for '8's in the units place. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one '8' in the units place. So, number of '8's is 48 (from 1 to 480) plus one more in 481 to 488, which is 488 itself. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 '8's in the units place.\n\nWait, that seems the same as '4's. So, in the units place, both '4' and '8' appear 49 times each. So, the difference in the units place is zero.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So, moving on to the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, '4' and '8' can appear as the second digit. So, for each hundred numbers, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9, and each digit appears 10 times in each hundred block.\n\nSo, from 1 to 488, how many hundreds do we have? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, we can think of it as four complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nWait, no. Actually, 488 is 4 hundreds, so from 1 to 400, that's four hundreds. Then from 401 to 488, that's 88 pages. So, let's calculate the '4's and '8's in the tens place.\n\nFirst, for '4's in the tens place. In each hundred block, the tens digit is '4' for exactly 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, etc. So, in each hundred, there are 10 '4's in the tens place. Since we have four complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), that's 4 * 10 = 40 '4's in the tens place from 1-400.\n\nNow, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is '4' for 10 numbers: 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So, that's another 10 '4's in the tens place. So, total '4's in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but hold on. From 401-488, the tens digit is '4' for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, that's 10 more. So, total '4's in tens place: 50.\n\nNow, for '8's in the tens place. Similarly, in each hundred block, the tens digit is '8' for 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. So, in each hundred, that's 10 '8's. Since we have four complete hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 '8's in the tens place from 1-400.\n\nNow, from 401-488, the tens digit is '8' for 10 numbers: 480-489. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, in 401-488, the tens digit '8' appears for 9 numbers: 480-488. So, that's 9 '8's in the tens place.\n\nTherefore, total '8's in the tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 401-488) = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, '4's appear 50 times and '8's appear 49 times. So, the difference here is 50 - 49 = 1.\n\nHmm, so so far, in the units and tens places, the difference is 1 in favor of '4's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, '4' and '8' can appear as the first digit. Let's see.\n\nFrom 1-488, the hundreds digit is '4' only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have '4' in the hundreds place? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, '4' appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but actually, each number from 400-488 has '4' in the hundreds place, so that's 89 numbers. So, 89 '4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about '8's in the hundreds place? Well, from 1-488, the hundreds digit can only be 0,1,2,3,4. So, '8' never appears in the hundreds place because 800 is beyond 488. So, the number of '8's in the hundreds place is zero.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, '4's appear 89 times, and '8's appear 0 times. So, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89.\n\nNow, let's sum up the differences from each digit place.\n\nUnits place: 49 '4's vs 49 '8's \u2192 difference 0.\n\nTens place: 50 '4's vs 49 '8's \u2192 difference +1.\n\nHundreds place: 89 '4's vs 0 '8's \u2192 difference +89.\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, units place: 48 full tens, each contributing one '4' and one '8', so 48 each, plus in the last partial ten (481-488), '4' appears once at 484, and '8' appears once at 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49 for both. So, units place difference is 0. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: For '4's, in each hundred, 10 '4's in the tens place. Four hundreds give 40, and in 401-488, the tens digit '4' is from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50 '4's. For '8's, in each hundred, 10 '8's in the tens place, so 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit '8' is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49 '8's. So, difference is 50 - 49 = 1. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: '4's appear from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 '4's. '8's don't appear in the hundreds place because 800 is beyond 488. So, 0 '8's. So, difference is 89.\n\nAdding up: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90. So, the total number of '4's is 90 more than '8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a '4' in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 '4's. But '8's in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no '8's in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count any numbers. For example, in the tens place, when I considered 440-449, those numbers are already included in the 400-488 range for the hundreds place. But since we're counting digits, each digit is counted separately, so that's okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the total number of '4's and '8's separately and then subtract.\n\nLet me try that approach to verify.\n\nTotal '4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal '4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nTotal '8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal '8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nYes, that matches the previous result. So, the number of '4's is 90 more than the number of '8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place in 401-488. I said that the tens digit '4' appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. Similarly, for '8's, the tens digit '8' appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that's 9 '8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a '4' in the hundreds place. So, 89 '4's. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, from 1-488, how many '4's? Every 10 numbers, one '4' in units place. So, 48 full tens, 48 '4's, plus one more in 484, so 49. Same for '8's: 48 full tens, plus one in 488, so 49.\n\nIn the tens place, '4's: 4 hundreds, each with 10 '4's, so 40, plus 10 in 440-449, so 50. '8's: 4 hundreds, each with 10 '8's, so 40, plus 9 in 480-488, so 49.\n\nSo, total '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I should list out the counts for each digit place again.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- '4's: floor(488/10) = 48, plus if the last number is >= 484, which it is (484 <= 488), so +1. Total 49.\n- '8's: floor(488/10) = 48, plus if the last number is >= 488, which it is, so +1. Total 49.\n\nTens place:\n\n- '4's: For each hundred, 10 '4's in the tens place. 4 hundreds give 40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), how many '4's in tens place? From 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n- '8's: Similarly, 4 hundreds give 40 '8's in tens place. In the last partial hundred, 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- '4's: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 '4's.\n- '8's: None, since 800 > 488.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n'4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n'8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more '4's than '8's.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another way to calculate the number of '4's and '8's. Maybe using the formula for digit counting.\n\nIn general, the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to n can be calculated by considering each digit place separately.\n\nFor a given digit place (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times a digit d appears can be calculated as follows:\n\nLet higher = number formed by digits higher than the current digit place.\n\ncurrent = current digit.\n\nlower = number formed by digits lower than the current digit place.\n\nThen, the count is:\n\ncount = higher * 10^power\n\nif current > d: count += 10^power\n\nif current == d: count += lower + 1\n\nBut since we're dealing with digits, maybe this formula can help.\n\nLet me try applying this formula for '4's and '8's in each digit place.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFor '4's in units place:\n\nn = 488\n\nunits place calculation:\n\nhigher = 48 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8, so higher = 48)\n\ncurrent = 8 (units digit of 488 is 8)\n\nlower = 8 (the lower part is 8)\n\nSo, count = higher * 10^0 + (if current > 4, add 10^0, else if current ==4, add lower +1)\n\nSince current is 8 >4, so count = 48 *1 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly for '8's in units place:\n\nhigher = 48\n\ncurrent =8\n\nlower=8\n\ncount = higher *1 + (if current >8, no, else if current ==8, add lower +1)\n\nSo, count =48 *1 + (8 +1) =48 +9=57? Wait, that doesn't match our previous count.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misapplying the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nFor a given digit position, the count is:\n\ncount = higher * 10^power\n\nif current_digit > target_digit: count += 10^power\n\nif current_digit == target_digit: count += (lower +1)\n\nSo, for units place, power=0, so 10^0=1.\n\nFor '4's:\n\nhigher = floor(488 /10) =48\n\ncurrent = 488 %10 =8\n\nlower = 88 %10 =8? Wait, no, lower is the number formed by digits below the current digit place, which for units place is 0, because there are no digits below units. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to refer to a standard digit counting method.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should stick to my initial method since it's giving me a consistent answer, and the formula might be more complex to apply correctly without errors.\n\nGiven that my initial method gave me 90 as the difference, and the alternative approach of counting each digit place separately also gave me 90, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nSo, after carefully considering each digit place and counting the occurrences of '4's and '8's, I conclude that there are 90 more '4's printed than '8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n</think>\n\nThe number of '4's printed is 90 more than the number of '8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We need to count how many times the digits '4' and '8' appear in all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n   - Calculate the difference between the number of '4's and '8's.\n\n2. **Break Down by Digit Places:**\n   - Consider units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n3. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total numbers: 488.\n   - Number of '4's in units place: floor(488/10) = 48, plus 1 if the last number is \u2265484 \u2192 49.\n   - Similarly, '8's: floor(488/10) = 48, plus 1 if \u2265488 \u2192 49.\n   - Difference in units place: 49 - 49 = 0.\n\n4. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - '4's: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 10 in 440-449 \u2192 50.\n   - '8's: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 9 in 480-488 \u2192 49.\n   - Difference in tens place: 50 - 49 = 1.\n\n5. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - '4's: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - '8's: None, since 800 > 488.\n   - Difference in hundreds place: 89 - 0 = 89.\n\n6. **Total Difference:**\n   - Sum the differences: 0 (units) + 1 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe number of '4's printed exceeds the number of '8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "hit_max_tokens": false,
    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Since 488 is a three-digit number, the page numbers go from 1 to 488, so I need to check each digit place for both 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 consecutive pages, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. So, for the units place, the number of 4's and 8's should be equal. But wait, let me check that.\n\nIf I divide 488 by 10, I get 48 full groups of 10 pages, and then 8 extra pages. So, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times, except for the last partial group. But since 488 is 48*10 + 8, the units digit goes up to 8 in the last partial group. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times, and 8 appears 48 times as well, plus one more time in the last group because 8 is included. Wait, no, because 488 ends with 8, so in the units place, 8 appears 49 times, and 4 appears 48 times. Hmm, I might have made a mistake here.\n\nWait, no, because each full group of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 488 pages, how many full groups of 10 are there? 48 full groups (since 48*10=480), and then 8 more pages. So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 times, and 8 appears 48 times from the full groups, plus one more 8 in the last group (page 488), making it 49 times for 8 and 48 times for 4. So, in the units place, 8 appears once more than 4.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every 100 pages. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times per hundred, and the same for 8. \n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, there are four full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, actually, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So, each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place. So, for four hundreds, that's 4*10=40 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place. Now, what about the remaining 88 pages (from 401 to 488)? Let me check the tens digit in this range.\n\nFrom 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So, in the tens place, each digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times, except for 8, which appears 8 times because we stop at 488. Wait, no, actually, from 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Let's see:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0\n- 411-420: tens digit 1\n- 421-430: tens digit 2\n- 431-440: tens digit 3\n- 441-450: tens digit 4\n- 451-460: tens digit 5\n- 461-470: tens digit 6\n- 471-480: tens digit 7\n- 481-490: tens digit 8, but we only go up to 488, so it's 8 pages (481-488), so the tens digit 8 appears 8 times here.\n\nSo, in the tens place for the last 88 pages (401-488), the digit 4 appears 10 times (from 441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (from 481-488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 8 times in the last partial hundred. So, overall, in the tens place, 4 appears 4*10 + 10 = 50 times, and 8 appears 4*10 + 8 = 48 times. Wait, no, that can't be right because the last partial hundred is 401-488, which is part of the fifth hundred? Wait, actually, 488 is in the 400s, so the full hundreds are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. So, in each full hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each, so 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8. So, four full hundreds would give 4*10=40 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes up to 8, as we saw. So, in the tens place, 4 appears once more (from 441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (from 481-488). So, total in tens place: 4 appears 40 + 10 = 50 times, and 8 appears 40 + 8 = 48 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 2 more times than 8.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me correct that. Each full hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place. So, four full hundreds would give 4*10=40 for each. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, total in the tens place: 4 appears 40 + 10 = 50 times, and 8 appears 40 + 8 = 48 times. So, 4 appears 2 more times than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. Each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has the hundreds digit fixed for 100 pages. So, in the hundreds place:\n\n- 1 appears 100 times (1-100)\n- 2 appears 100 times (101-200)\n- 3 appears 100 times (201-300)\n- 4 appears 100 times (301-400)\n- And then from 401-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so 88 pages.\n\nWait, so from 401-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 88 more times. So, total for 4 in the hundreds place is 100 (from 301-400) + 88 (from 401-488) = 188 times. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 188 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each place:\n\nUnits place:\n- 4 appears 48 times\n- 8 appears 49 times\n\nTens place:\n- 4 appears 50 times\n- 8 appears 48 times\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears 188 times\n- 8 appears 0 times\n\nTotal for 4: 48 + 50 + 188 = 286\nTotal for 8: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nWait, that can't be right because 286 - 97 = 189, which seems too high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units place. Let me re-examine that.\n\nIn the units place, each digit from 0-9 appears equally in each set of 10 pages. So, for 488 pages, how many full sets of 10 are there? 48 full sets (since 48*10=480), and then 8 extra pages (481-488). So, in each full set, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, 48 times each. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). Therefore, in the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, they are equal in the units place. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier by thinking 8 appears one more time. It's actually equal because both 4 and 8 are included in the last partial set.\n\nSo, units place:\n- 4: 49\n- 8: 49\n\nTens place: As before, in the tens place, each hundred contributes 10 times for each digit. So, four full hundreds give 40 each. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digits go from 0-8. So, 4 appears once (from 440-449, which is 10 pages, but wait, 441-450 is 10 pages, so the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 pages (480-488), so 8 appears 8 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 401-488 includes 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488 inclusive is 9 pages, but wait, 480 is included, so 480-488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times? Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 pages (480, 481,...,488), so the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so 9 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 pages, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the last partial hundred.\n\nSimilarly, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times in the last partial hundred.\n\nTherefore, total in tens place:\n\n- 4: 4*10 + 10 = 50\n- 8: 4*10 + 9 = 49\n\nSo, 4 appears once more than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nAs before, 4 appears 100 times in 301-400 and 88 times in 401-488, totaling 188 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, hundreds place:\n- 4: 188\n- 8: 0\n\nNow, summing up:\n\nUnits: 49 each\nTens: 50 for 4, 49 for 8\nHundreds: 188 for 4, 0 for 8\n\nTotal for 4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 188 (hundreds) = 49+50=99; 99+188=287\nTotal for 8: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nWait, so 4 appears 287 times and 8 appears 98 times. So, the difference is 287 - 98 = 189.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the tens place. Let me recount the tens place in the last partial hundred (401-488).\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears exactly 10 times, except for the last one, which might be less.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490), but since we stop at 488, the tens digit 8 only appears from 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, in the tens place:\n\n- 0: 10 times (401-410)\n- 1: 10 times (411-420)\n- 2: 10 times (421-430)\n- 3: 10 times (431-440)\n- 4: 10 times (441-450)\n- 5: 10 times (451-460)\n- 6: 10 times (461-470)\n- 7: 10 times (471-480)\n- 8: 9 times (481-488)\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times in the last partial hundred. Therefore, total in tens place:\n\n- 4: 4*10 (from full hundreds) + 10 = 50\n- 8: 4*10 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 49\n\nSo, that part is correct.\n\nUnits place: 49 each.\n\nHundreds place: 188 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 188 = 287\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 287 - 98 = 189.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me check another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) + (1 if 488 mod 10 >=4 else 0). Wait, no, that's not the right formula. Actually, in the units place, the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to n is:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: floor(n/10)\nEach complete group contributes 1 occurrence of d in the units place.\nThen, check the remainder: if the remainder is >= d, add 1 more.\n\nSo, for 4:\n\nNumber of 4's in units place = floor(488/10) + (1 if 488%10 >=4 else 0)\nfloor(488/10) = 48\n488%10 = 8, which is >=4, so add 1.\nTotal: 48 + 1 = 49\n\nSimilarly for 8:\n\nNumber of 8's in units place = floor(488/10) + (1 if 488%10 >=8 else 0)\nfloor(488/10) = 48\n488%10 =8, which is >=8, so add 1.\nTotal:48 +1=49\n\nSo, units place: both 4 and 8 appear 49 times.\n\nFor tens place:\n\nThe formula is similar but for tens digit. The number of times a digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to n is:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 100: floor(n/100)\nEach complete group contributes 10 occurrences of d in the tens place.\nThen, check the remainder beyond the last complete hundred:\nIf the remainder is >= 10*(d+1), add 10\nIf the remainder is between 10*d and 10*(d+1)-1, add (remainder -10*d +1)\nIf the remainder <10*d, add 0.\n\nSo, for 4 in the tens place:\n\nn=488\nfloor(488/100)=4\nEach contributes 10, so 4*10=40\nRemainder=488 - 4*100=88\nNow, check if 88 >=10*(4+1)=50\nSince 88 >=50, add 10\nTotal for 4 in tens place:40 +10=50\n\nFor 8 in the tens place:\n\nSame approach:\nfloor(488/100)=4\n4*10=40\nRemainder=88\nCheck if 88 >=10*(8+1)=90? No, because 88 <90\nSo, check if 88 >=10*8=80\nYes, so add (88 -80 +1)=9\nTotal for 8 in tens place:40 +9=49\n\nSo, tens place: 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\nThe formula is:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 1000: floor(n/1000)\nEach contributes 100 occurrences of d in the hundreds place if d<=floor(n/1000)\nWait, perhaps better to think as:\n\nFor each digit d in hundreds place, the number of times it appears is:\n\nIf d < floor(n/1000), then 100 times per d\nIf d == floor(n/1000), then (n - d*100 +1) times\n\nBut since n=488 <1000, floor(n/1000)=0, so hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nWait, but page numbers start at 1, so hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, etc.\n\nSo, for hundreds digit:\n\n- 0: pages 1-99: 99 pages, but hundreds digit is 0, which we don't count as 0 is not printed.\nWait, actually, in page numbers, leading zeros are not printed, so pages 1-9 are single-digit, 10-99 are two-digit. So, the hundreds digit is only printed starting from page 100.\n\nSo, for hundreds digit:\n\n- 1: pages 100-199: 100 pages\n- 2: 200-299:100\n- 3:300-399:100\n- 4:400-488:89 pages (since 488 is the last page)\n\nWait, 400-488 is 89 pages because 488-400+1=89.\n\nSo, for hundreds digit:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, hundreds place:\n- 4:89\n- 8:0\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4 appears 188 times, but that was a mistake. Actually, in the hundreds place, 4 appears only from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nWait, let me correct that.\n\nSo, hundreds place:\n\n- 1:100-199:100 pages\n- 2:200-299:100\n- 3:300-399:100\n- 4:400-488:89 pages\n\nSo, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total for 4:\n\nUnits:49\nTens:50\nHundreds:89\nTotal:49+50=99; 99+89=188\n\nFor 8:\n\nUnits:49\nTens:49\nHundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98\n\nSo, 4 appears 188 times, 8 appears 98 times.\n\nDifference:188 -98=90\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier calculation. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nEarlier, I thought that in the hundreds place, 4 appears 188 times because I was considering 100 pages for 301-400 and 88 pages for 401-488, totaling 188. But that's incorrect because the hundreds digit is 3 for 301-400 and 4 for 401-488. So, 301-400 is 100 pages with hundreds digit 3, and 401-488 is 88 pages with hundreds digit 4. So, 4 appears 88 times in the hundreds place, not 188.\n\nWait, no, 301-400 is 100 pages, and 401-488 is 88 pages, so total for hundreds digit 4 is 88 pages, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 88 times.\n\nWait, but 400 is included in 401-488? No, 400 is the start of the 400s, but 401-488 is 88 pages. So, 400 is page 400, which is part of the 400-488 range, right? Wait, 400 is included in the 400-488 range, so 400-488 is 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, 89 times.\n\nSo, hundreds place for 4:89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188\nTotal 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nWait, that's 90 more 4's than 8's. But earlier, I thought it was 189, which was wrong because I miscounted the hundreds place.\n\nWait, let me confirm with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place.\n\nUnits place:\n\nAs before, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times.\n\nTens place:\n\n4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4 appears 188 times in the hundreds place, which was wrong. It's actually 89 times.\n\nSo, the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again.\n\nFrom page 1 to 488:\n\n- Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (not printed)\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit 1 (100 times)\n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit 2 (100 times)\n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit 3 (100 times)\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit 4 (89 times)\n\nSo, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, yes, total 4's:49+50+89=188\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\nDifference:90\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in the units place every 10 pages.\n   - Total pages: 488.\n   - Number of full groups of 10: 48 (since 48*10=480).\n   - Remaining pages: 8 (481-488).\n   - In each full group, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place.\n   - In the remaining 8 pages, both 4 and 8 appear once (at 484 and 488).\n   - **Total in units place:** 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times; 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 pages.\n   - Number of full hundreds: 4 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400).\n   - Each full hundred contributes 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place.\n   - Remaining pages: 401-488 (88 pages).\n   - Tens digits in 401-488: 0-8.\n     - 4 appears 10 times (440-449).\n     - 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - **Total in tens place:** 4 appears 4*10 + 10 = 50 times; 8 appears 4*10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 100 occurrences of the hundreds digit.\n   - Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (not printed).\n   - Pages 100-199: hundreds digit 1 (100 times).\n   - Pages 200-299: hundreds digit 2 (100 times).\n   - Pages 300-399: hundreds digit 3 (100 times).\n   - Pages 400-488: hundreds digit 4 (89 times).\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 4 appears 89 times; 8 appears 0 times.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 times.\n   - **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 times.\n   - **Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should understand the problem clearly. The book has pages numbered from 1 to 488, and each page number is printed once. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nAlright, so I need to count the occurrences of the digit 4 and 8 in each position of the page numbers: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Let me break this down position by position.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, in 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. Similarly, in 11-20, it's 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0 again. So, every 10 numbers, each digit appears once in the units place.\n\nNow, how many sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10 and then an extra 8 numbers (481-488). So, for the units place, the digit 4 will appear 48 times (once in each set of 10), and then we have to check the remaining 8 numbers (481-488). In these, 484 has a 4 in the units place, so that's one more. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, each set of 10 has one 8, so 48 times, and then in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So, total 8's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. Hmm, that's interesting. So, the difference here is zero. But let's not jump to conclusions yet; we need to check the tens place as well.\n\nMoving on to the tens place: The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, 488 is less than 500, so we have four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. Wait, actually, 401-488 is 88 numbers, not a full hundred. So, let's calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nStarting with the digit 4 in the tens place: It appears in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. However, since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 440-449, which is fully included. So, that's 5 sets of 10, so 5 x 10 = 50 times for the digit 4 in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1-400, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's in 40-49 (10 times), 140-149 (10 times), 240-249 (10 times), 340-349 (10 times), and 440-449 (10 times). So that's 5 times 10, which is 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 times.\n\nNow, for the digit 8 in the tens place: It appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers. So, in each of the first four ranges (80-89, etc.), it's 10 times each, and in 480-488, it's 9 times. So, total for 8 in the tens place would be 4 x 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. From 1-400, the 8 in the tens place occurs in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 40 + 9 = 49 times. So, 49 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times. So, the difference here is 50 - 49 = 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, actually, 400-488 is part of the 400s, so the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's than 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the differences from each place:\n\n- Units place: 49 - 49 = 0\n- Tens place: 50 - 49 = 1\n- Hundreds place: 89 - 0 = 89\n\nTotal difference = 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place: For 488 pages, the number of times 4 appears in units place is 48 full decades (each contributing one 4) plus one more in 484, so 49. Similarly, 8 in units place is 48 full decades plus 488, so 49. So, that's correct.\n\nTens place: 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 times. 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. That's 4 full sets (each 10) and one partial set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 50-49=1. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times. 8 never appears in hundreds place. So, 89-0=89. Correct.\n\nAdding up: 0+1+89=90. So, the total number of 4's printed is 90 more than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again: When counting the hundreds place, is it 89 times? Because from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, yes, 89 times. So, 89 is correct.\n\nSo, total difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full sets (480 pages) + 8 extra pages (481-488).\n   - 4's: 48 times in full sets + 1 in 484 \u2192 49.\n   - 8's: 48 times in full sets + 1 in 488 \u2192 49.\n   - Difference: 49 - 49 = 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - 4's: Appear in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - 8's: Appear in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 4 sets \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n   - Difference: 50 - 49 = 1.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4's: Appear in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n   - 8's: Do not appear in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n   - Difference: 89 - 0 = 89.\n\nSumming the differences: 0 (units) + 1 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I need to understand that each page number from 1 to 488 is printed once. So, I'm looking at all the digits from 1 up to 488 and counting how many times the digit 4 appears versus how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the different places where digits can appear: the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place. I'll analyze each digit position separately for both 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, in the units place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers, which is 48 full groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. So, the digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers, so 48 times for the full groups, and then in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once more. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place: Again, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. So, 48 full groups give 48 eights, and in the last 8 numbers, 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because when I count the 8's, in the last group, 488 has two 8's: one in the tens and one in the units place. Hmm, but I'm only considering the units place right now, so in the units place, it's just once. So, 49 eights in units place, same as 4's.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see, from 1 to 488, we can think of it as 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in 401-409, the tens digit is 0; 410-419, it's 1; and so on up to 480-488, where the tens digit is 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? Well, 440-449 would have the tens digit as 4, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So, that's 10 more times. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place: Each hundred has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, 4 hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40 eights. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes up to 8, so 480-488 has the tens digit as 8. That's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's 9 occurrences. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 8, it's from 480 to 488. But 480 is included, so that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, yes, 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's see how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 times.\n\nFor the digit 8 in the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can only be 8 from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences for 4 and 8.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nFirst, units place for 4: 48 full tens (each contributing 1) and then in 481-488, 484 has a 4 in units. So, 48 +1=49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place for 4: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40, plus in 401-488, 440-449 is 10 more, so 50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 4: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each with one 8, so 48, plus 488 has an 8 in units, so 49. Correct.\n\nTens place for 8: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40, plus in 401-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9. Total 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 8: 0, since we don't reach 800. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I should probably understand how page numbers are structured. Each page number is a three-digit number, right? Wait, no, actually, the first page is 1, so pages 1 through 9 are single-digit, 10 through 99 are two-digit, and 100 through 488 are three-digit. So, the page numbers can be one, two, or three digits long. \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the problem into single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit page numbers.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: pages 1 to 9. In this range, the digits are 1 through 9. So, how many 4's are there? Just one, which is page 4. Similarly, how many 8's? Just one, which is page 8. So, in single-digit pages, the count for 4's is 1 and for 8's is 1. The difference here is 0.\n\nNext, let's look at two-digit page numbers: pages 10 to 99. Here, each page number is of the form AB, where A is the tens digit and B is the units digit. So, A can be from 1 to 9, and B can be from 0 to 9.\n\nI need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place. Similarly for 8.\n\nFirst, counting the number of 4's in two-digit page numbers.\n\n- Tens place: If A is 4, then the tens digit is 4. The units digit can be anything from 0 to 9, so that's 10 possibilities. So, 10 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\n- Units place: If B is 4, then the units digit is 4. The tens digit can be from 1 to 9, so that's 9 possibilities (since A can't be 0). Wait, no, actually, in two-digit numbers, A starts from 1, so for units digit 4, the tens digit can be 1-9, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times 4 appears in the units place.\n\nWait, but hold on, when A is 4, the units digit can be 0-9, so that's 10 numbers: 40, 41, ..., 49. So, 10 times. Similarly, when B is 4, the tens digit can be 1-9, so 14, 24, ..., 94. That's 9 numbers. So, total 4's in two-digit pages: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in two-digit pages:\n\n- Tens place: A is 8, so 80 to 89. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\n- Units place: B is 8, so the tens digit can be 1-9, giving us 18, 28, ..., 98. That's 9 numbers. So, total 8's in two-digit pages: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nSo, in two-digit pages, both 4's and 8's appear 19 times each. So, the difference here is also 0.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: pages 100 to 488. These are numbers from 100 up to 488, so each is of the form ABC, where A is the hundreds digit, B is the tens digit, and C is the units digit.\n\nI need to count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place across all three-digit page numbers from 100 to 488.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book has 488 pages, so the highest hundreds digit is 4.\n\n- For 4's in the hundreds place: Only when A=4. So, pages 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times.\n\n- For 8's in the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can't be 8 because the book only goes up to 488. So, hundreds digit 8 would start at 800, which is beyond 488. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit can be 0-9, but we need to consider all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488.\n\nTo count the number of times 4 appears in the tens place:\n\n- For each hundreds digit (1, 2, 3, 4), the tens digit cycles from 0-9. But since we go up to 488, when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can only go up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). Wait, no, 488 is the last page, so when hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can be from 0 to 8, because 490 would be beyond 488.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. When hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can be from 0 to 8 because 488 is the maximum. So, for hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, the tens digit can be 0-9, but for hundreds digit 4, tens digit can only be 0-8.\n\nSo, for 4's in the tens place:\n\n- For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: For each, the tens digit can be 0-9. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place for each hundreds digit? Once per hundreds digit. So, for hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, each contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, 340-349). Wait, no, that's 10 numbers per hundreds digit where the tens digit is 4. So, for hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, each contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, that's 3 * 10 = 30 times.\n\n- For hundreds digit 4: The tens digit can be 0-8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Only once, at 440-449, but wait, no, 440-449 would be 10 numbers, but since the maximum is 488, 440-449 is within range because 449 is less than 488. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is fine. So, that's 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, for hundreds digit 4, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that for hundreds digit 4, the tens digit can only go up to 8, but 440-449 is within 488, so it's allowed. So, total 4's in tens place: 30 (from hundreds 1-3) + 10 (from hundreds 4) = 40 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place:\n\n- For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each can have the tens digit as 8, so 10 numbers each (e.g., 180-189, 280-289, 380-389). So, 3 * 10 = 30 times.\n\n- For hundreds digit 4: The tens digit can be 0-8, so 8 appears in the tens place only once, at 480-489, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times for hundreds digit 4.\n\nWait, but when the tens digit is 8, the units digit can be 0-9, but since we're limited to 488, the units digit can only go up to 8 when the tens digit is 8. So, for hundreds digit 4, tens digit 8, the numbers are 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nSo, total 8's in tens place: 30 (from hundreds 1-3) + 9 (from hundreds 4) = 39 times.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 4's in tens place: 40, 8's in tens place: 39. So, difference in tens place is 1 more 4 than 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place. For three-digit numbers, the units digit can be 0-9. So, we need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the units place across all three-digit page numbers from 100 to 488.\n\nLet me break this down by hundreds digits again.\n\nFor each hundreds digit (1, 2, 3, 4), the units digit cycles through 0-9 for each tens digit. But again, for hundreds digit 4, we have to be careful up to 488.\n\nFirst, for 4's in the units place:\n\n- For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each hundreds digit can have the units digit as 4. How many times? For each hundreds digit, the tens digit can be 0-9, so 10 possibilities. So, for each hundreds digit, 10 times 4 appears in the units place. So, 3 * 10 = 30 times.\n\n- For hundreds digit 4: The units digit can be 4, but we have to consider the range up to 488. So, for hundreds digit 4, the units digit is 4, and the tens digit can be 0-8 (since 488 is the maximum). So, how many numbers? For each tens digit from 0 to 8, there's a number ending with 4. So, that's 9 numbers: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, 484 is within 488, but 494 would be beyond, but since we're only up to 488, the tens digit can only go up to 8, so 9 numbers. So, 9 times 4 appears in the units place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 30 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place:\n\n- For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each can have the units digit as 8. For each hundreds digit, the tens digit can be 0-9, so 10 numbers each. So, 3 * 10 = 30 times.\n\n- For hundreds digit 4: The units digit can be 8, and the tens digit can be 0-8 (since 488 is the maximum). So, how many numbers? For each tens digit from 0 to 8, there's a number ending with 8. So, 9 numbers: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. So, 9 times 8 appears in the units place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nSo, total 8's in units place: 30 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, in the units place, both 4's and 8's appear 39 times. So, the difference here is 0.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place across all page numbers.\n\nFirst, single-digit pages:\n\n- 4's: 1\n- 8's: 1\n\nTwo-digit pages:\n\n- 4's: 19\n- 8's: 19\n\nThree-digit pages:\n\n- 4's: hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n- 8's: hundreds place (0) + tens place (39) + units place (39) = 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nWait, let me check that again. For three-digit pages, the 4's in hundreds place are 89, tens place 40, units place 39. So, 89 + 40 is 129, plus 39 is 168. For 8's, hundreds place is 0, tens place is 39, units place is 39. So, 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was counting 8's in the tens place for three-digit numbers, I got 39, and in the units place also 39, so total 78. That seems correct.\n\nNow, adding up all the page numbers:\n\nTotal 4's = single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (168) = 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n\nTotal 8's = single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78) = 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 188 - 98 = 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with single-digit:\n\n4's: 1 (page 4)\n8's: 1 (page 8)\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n4's: 10 (tens place 40-49) + 9 (units place 14,24,...,94) = 19\n8's: 10 (tens place 80-89) + 9 (units place 18,28,...,98) = 19\n\nThree-digit:\n\n4's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\n- Tens place: For hundreds 1-3, each has 10 numbers with tens digit 4 (e.g., 140-149), so 3*10=30. For hundreds 4, tens digit 4 can be from 400-449, which is 50 numbers, but wait, no, in the tens place, it's the second digit, so 400-409 would have tens digit 0, 410-419 tens digit 1, etc. So, when tens digit is 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 times for hundreds digit 4. So, total 30 + 10 = 40.\n\n- Units place: For hundreds 1-3, each has 10 numbers where units digit is 4 (e.g., 104,114,...,194), so 10 per hundreds digit, 3*10=30. For hundreds digit 4, units digit 4 can be from 404,414,...,484, which is 9 numbers (since 494 would be beyond 488). So, 9 times. So, total 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, 4's in three-digit: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\n8's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\n- Tens place: For hundreds 1-3, each has 10 numbers where tens digit is 8 (e.g., 180-189), so 3*10=30. For hundreds digit 4, tens digit 8 can be from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 9 times. So, total 30 + 9 = 39.\n\n- Units place: For hundreds 1-3, each has 10 numbers where units digit is 8 (e.g., 108,118,...,198), so 3*10=30. For hundreds digit 4, units digit 8 can be from 408,418,...,488, which is 9 numbers (since 498 is beyond 488). So, 9 times. So, total 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, 8's in three-digit: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Single-Digit Pages (1-9):**\n   - **4's:** 1 occurrence (page 4)\n   - **8's:** 1 occurrence (page 8)\n   - **Difference:** 0\n\n2. **Two-Digit Pages (10-99):**\n   - **4's:**\n     - Tens place: 10 (40-49)\n     - Units place: 9 (14, 24, ..., 94)\n     - Total: 19\n   - **8's:**\n     - Tens place: 10 (80-89)\n     - Units place: 9 (18, 28, ..., 98)\n     - Total: 19\n   - **Difference:** 0\n\n3. **Three-Digit Pages (100-488):**\n   - **4's:**\n     - Hundreds place: 89 (400-488)\n     - Tens place: 40 (140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449)\n     - Units place: 39 (104, 114, ..., 394, 404, 414, ..., 484)\n     - Total: 168\n   - **8's:**\n     - Hundreds place: 0\n     - Tens place: 39 (180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488)\n     - Units place: 39 (108, 118, ..., 398, 408, 418, ..., 488)\n     - Total: 78\n   - **Difference:** 168 - 78 = 90\n\n4. **Total Count:**\n   - **4's:** 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188\n   - **8's:** 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98\n   - **Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should understand the problem clearly. Each page from 1 to 488 is printed once, and I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense.\n\nLet me start by considering how digits are counted in numbers. Page numbers can be 1-digit, 2-digit, or 3-digit numbers since 488 is a 3-digit number. So, I can break this down into units place, tens place, and hundreds place separately for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nI think the best approach is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each place (units, tens, hundreds) separately and then add them up.\n\nLet's start with the digit 4.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place.\n   - How many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a block, we take the integer part, which is 48 complete blocks. Each block contributes 1 four in the units place, so that's 48 fours.\n   - Now, in the remaining 8 pages (since 48*10 = 480, and we go up to 488), the units digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in the units place, does 4 appear again? Yes, at page 484. So that's one more four. So total units place fours: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 100 numbers. Each cycle of 100 has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n   - How many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488? That's 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10 = 40 fours.\n   - Now, the remaining pages are from 401 to 488. The tens digit in this range goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 in the block 440-449. How many numbers are there here? From 440 to 449, that's 10 numbers. So that's 10 fours in the tens place.\n   - So total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400 to 488. How many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the fours:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal fours = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Yes, that seems right.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\nNow, I'll do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to fours, every block of 10 has one 8 in the units place.\n   - Number of complete blocks of 10 in 488 is 48, contributing 48 eights.\n   - Remaining pages 481-488: units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 8 appears once at 488. So total units place eights: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100. Each block of 100 has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 8 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n   - Number of complete blocks of 100 is 4, contributing 4*10 = 40 eights.\n   - Remaining pages 401-488: the tens digit in this range goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 8 in the block 480-489. However, since our book ends at 488, it's 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 in these 9 numbers. So, 9 eights in the tens place.\n   - So total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. Therefore, hundreds place eights: 0.\n\nAdding up all the eights:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal eights = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, let me check again. 49 + 49 is 98, correct.\n\n**Calculating the difference:**\nNumber of fours is 188, number of eights is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, so the difference is 90. That seems like a lot, but let me verify my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for fours:\n- Units: 48 blocks *1 +1 (484) =49.

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488. Then, I'll do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the positions where digits can appear: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll handle each digit position separately for both 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** \n   - Every 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484.\n   - Since the book has 488 pages, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete groups of 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups. But wait, the last page is 488, so the units digit cycles up to 8. So, actually, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 because 488 / 10 = 48.8, but we take the integer part, which is 48. Hmm, but wait, let me think again. From 1 to 488, the number of times the units digit is 4 is actually floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 is the last page, the 48th group ends at 480, so the 48th 4 is at 484, which is within 488. So, yes, 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 pages, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449.\n   - How many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete groups (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial group from 401-488.\n   - Each complete group contributes 10 times the digit 4 in the tens place, so 4 groups give 4*10 = 40.\n   - Now, the partial group from 401-488: the tens digit is 4 for pages 401-410, which is 10 pages. So, that's another 10.\n   - Wait, but 488 is beyond 410, so does the tens digit go beyond 4? Let me check. Pages 401-410 have tens digit 0, but wait no, wait: 401-410: 401 has tens digit 0, 410 has tens digit 1. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, actually, 401-410: the tens digit cycles from 0 to 1. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me correct this. \n\nWait, I think I made a mistake here. Let's think again. The tens digit in the range 401-488: \n\n- From 401 to 410: the tens digit is 0 (for 401-410), but wait, no, 401 is 401, so the tens digit is 0, 410 is 410, tens digit is 1. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 401 is 4 0 1, so tens digit is 0. 410 is 4 1 0, so tens digit is 1. So, the tens digit is 4 only when the tens place is 4. So, in the range 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449. So, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages: 440-449.\n\nSo, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times in the partial group. So total for tens place: 4*10 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but let me check again. From 1-100: 40-49 is 10 times. 101-200: 140-149 is 10 times. 201-300: 240-249 is 10 times. 301-400: 340-349 is 10 times. Then 401-488: 440-449 is 10 times. So that's 5 groups, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. So yes, 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. So, how many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages, so that's 89 times the digit 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first page with hundreds digit 4, and 488 is the last. So, from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 pages. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nAgain, considering units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, every 10 pages, the digit 8 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n   - 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8. So, 48 times. But wait, the last page is 488, so the units digit is 8, which is included in the 48th group (480-489, but we only go up to 488). So, yes, 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 pages, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the last group is 480-488, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages (480-488). Wait, no, let me think.\n\nWait, in the tens place, each group of 100 pages has a block where the tens digit is 8, which is 10 pages. So, from 1-100: 80-89, 10 pages. 101-200: 180-189, 10 pages. 201-300: 280-289, 10 pages. 301-400: 380-389, 10 pages. Then, 401-488: the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 pages (480-488). So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nLet's calculate:\n\n- Complete groups: 4 groups (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40.\n\n- Partial group (401-488): tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 times (since 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 pages, right? 480,481,...,488. So yes, 9 times.\n\nSo, total in tens place: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only for pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 +49 +0=97.\n\nWait, let me check: units 48, tens 49, hundreds 0, so 48+49=97.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 -97=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:48+50=98; 98+89=187.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:48\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:48+49=97.\n\nDifference:187-97=90.\n\nYes, that seems right. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 187 - 97 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. The book has pages numbered from 1 to 488, and each page number is printed once. I have to count how many times the digit '4' appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit '8'. After that, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. Got it.\n\nLet me start by considering how digits are distributed in page numbers. Page numbers can be one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit numbers. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 up to 488. So, the page numbers can be broken down as follows:\n\n- Pages 1 to 9: These are single-digit page numbers.\n- Pages 10 to 99: These are two-digit page numbers.\n- Pages 100 to 488: These are three-digit page numbers.\n\nI think it's best to analyze each segment separately to count the occurrences of the digits '4' and '8'. Let me tackle each segment one by one.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers (1-9). In this range, each digit from 1 to 9 appears exactly once. So, for the digit '4', it appears once, and the digit '8' also appears once. That means in single-digit pages, the count for both digits is the same: 1 each. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nMoving on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I need to count how many times '4' and '8' appear in each place.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Tens place for two-digit numbers:**\n   - For the digit '4' in the tens place: The numbers would be 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so '4' appears 10 times in the tens place.\n   - For the digit '8' in the tens place: The numbers would be 80-89. Again, 10 numbers, so '8' appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\n2. **Units place for two-digit numbers:**\n   - For the digit '4' in the units place: In each set of ten numbers (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit '4' appears once in the units place. There are 9 sets (from 10-19 up to 90-99), so '4' appears 9 times in the units place.\n   - Similarly, for the digit '8' in the units place: It also appears once per set of ten, so 9 times in total.\n\nWait, but hold on. From 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers, which is 9 sets of 10. So, each digit in the units place appears 9 times, right? So, '4' appears 9 times in the units place, and '8' appears 9 times as well.\n\nAdding up the counts for two-digit numbers:\n\n- For '4': 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times.\n- For '8': 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times.\n\nSo, in two-digit page numbers, both '4' and '8' appear 19 times each. The difference here is also zero.\n\nNow, onto the three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because there are three places to consider: hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nLet me break this down by each digit place.\n\n1. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book ends at 488.\n   - For the digit '4' in the hundreds place: Pages 400-488. That's 89 pages (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, '4' appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n   - For the digit '8' in the hundreds place: Well, the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, '8' never appears in the hundreds place in three-digit page numbers here. So, zero times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit can be any digit from 0 to 9, but we have to consider the entire range up to 488.\n   - Let's consider the hundreds digit first. For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, the tens and units digits can range freely from 00 to 99, but when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can only go up to 8 because the book ends at 488.\n\n   So, breaking it down:\n\n   - For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3:\n     - Each of these hundreds digits (1, 2, 3) will have 100 numbers each (from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399).\n     - In each of these, the tens place can be 0-9, and the units place can be 0-9.\n     - So, for each hundreds group, the digit '4' in the tens place appears 10 times (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, 340-349). Similarly, '8' in the tens place appears 10 times (e.g., 180-189, 280-289, 380-389).\n     - Since there are three such hundreds groups (1, 2, 3), the total for '4' in the tens place is 3 * 10 = 30. Similarly, '8' is also 3 * 10 = 30.\n\n   - For hundreds digit 4:\n     - Pages 400-488.\n     - The tens digit can be from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digits possible are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n     - For each tens digit, the units digit goes from 0-9, except when the tens digit is 8, where the units digit only goes up to 8 (since 488 is the last page).\n\n     Let me handle this carefully.\n\n     - For tens digits 0-7:\n       - Each of these (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7) will have 10 numbers each (e.g., 400-409, 410-419, etc.).\n       - So, for each tens digit 0-7, the digit '4' in the tens place occurs once per ten numbers. So, for each of these, if the tens digit is '4', then '4' appears 10 times. Similarly, if the tens digit is '8', then '8' appears 10 times.\n\n       Wait, but in this case, the tens digits are 0-7, so neither '4' nor '8' in the tens place here, except when the tens digit is '4' or '8'.\n\n       Wait, no. The tens digit in 400-488 can be 0-8. So, when the tens digit is '4', that's one occurrence, and when it's '8', that's another.\n\n       Let me correct this approach.\n\n       For the hundreds digit 4:\n\n       - The tens digit can be 0-8.\n\n       So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8:\n\n       - When the tens digit is '4', the numbers are 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so '4' appears 10 times in the tens place.\n       - When the tens digit is '8', the numbers are 480-488. That's 9 numbers (since it goes up to 488), so '8' appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\n       For other tens digits (0,1,2,3,5,6,7), the digits '4' and '8' don't appear in the tens place.\n\n       So, in the hundreds digit 4 group:\n\n       - '4' appears 10 times in the tens place (from 440-449).\n       - '8' appears 9 times in the tens place (from 480-488).\n\n       Now, for the units place in the hundreds digit 4 group:\n\n       - The units digit can be 0-9, except when the tens digit is 8, where it's only 0-8.\n\n       Wait, no. Actually, for each tens digit, the units digit can be 0-9 except when the tens digit is 8, in which case the units digit can only be 0-8 because the last page is 488.\n\n       So, let's break down the units place for each tens digit in the hundreds digit 4 group.\n\n       - For tens digits 0-7:\n         - Each has 10 numbers, so for each, the units digit can be 0-9.\n         - So, for each of these tens digits, the digit '4' in the units place appears once per ten numbers (e.g., 404, 414, etc.), so 10 times per tens digit.\n         - Similarly, '8' in the units place appears once per ten numbers (e.g., 408, 418, etc.), so 10 times per tens digit.\n\n         Wait, but wait, each tens digit group (like 400-409, 410-419, etc.) has 10 numbers, so the units digit cycles through 0-9. Therefore, in each of these, '4' and '8' each appear once in the units place.\n\n         So, for each tens digit from 0-7, '4' appears once in the units place, and '8' appears once in the units place.\n\n         There are 8 such tens digits (0-7), so:\n\n         - '4' appears 8 times in the units place.\n         - '8' appears 8 times in the units place.\n\n       - For tens digit 8:\n         - The numbers are 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n         - The units digits are 0-8.\n         - So, the digit '4' in the units place appears once (484).\n         - The digit '8' in the units place appears once (488).\n\n         So, in the tens digit 8 group:\n\n         - '4' appears once in the units place.\n         - '8' appears once in the units place.\n\n       Now, adding up the units place counts for hundreds digit 4:\n\n       - '4' appears 8 (from tens digits 0-7) + 1 (from tens digit 8) = 9 times.\n       - '8' appears 8 (from tens digits 0-7) + 1 (from tens digit 8) = 9 times.\n\n       So, in the hundreds digit 4 group, for the units place:\n\n       - '4' appears 9 times.\n       - '8' appears 9 times.\n\n       Now, let me summarize the counts for the hundreds digit 4 group:\n\n       - Hundreds place: '4' appears 89 times (from 400-488).\n       - Tens place: '4' appears 10 times (440-449), '8' appears 9 times (480-488).\n       - Units place: '4' appears 9 times, '8' appears 9 times.\n\n       Wait, no, I think I made a mistake earlier. The hundreds place is separate from the tens and units. So, the hundreds digit '4' contributes 89 times for '4' in the hundreds place, and zero for '8' in the hundreds place.\n\n       Then, in the tens place, as calculated, '4' appears 10 times, and '8' appears 9 times.\n\n       In the units place, as calculated, '4' appears 9 times, and '8' appears 9 times.\n\n       So, adding up for the hundreds digit 4 group:\n\n       - '4's: 89 (hundreds) + 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 108 times.\n       - '8's: 0 (hundreds) + 9 (tens) + 9 (units) = 18 times.\n\n       Wait, that seems correct? Let me check.\n\n       Wait, no. Actually, in the hundreds digit 4 group, the hundreds digit is '4' for all 89 pages, so that's 89 '4's in the hundreds place. Then, in the tens place, as we saw, '4' appears 10 times (440-449) and '8' appears 9 times (480-488). In the units place, '4' appears 9 times and '8' appears 9 times.\n\n       So, yes, that adds up to 89 + 10 + 9 = 108 '4's and 0 + 9 + 9 = 18 '8's in the hundreds digit 4 group.\n\n       Now, moving on to the hundreds digits 1, 2, 3:\n\n       For each of these hundreds digits (1, 2, 3), the page numbers range from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399.\n\n       Let's calculate the occurrences of '4' and '8' in each place for these groups.\n\n       1. **Hundreds place:**\n          - For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, the hundreds digit is never '4' or '8', so '4' and '8' each appear 0 times in the hundreds place for these groups.\n\n       2. **Tens place:**\n          - For each hundreds group (1, 2, 3), the tens digit cycles through 0-9, and for each tens digit, the units digit cycles through 0-9.\n          - So, for each hundreds group, the digit '4' in the tens place appears 10 times (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, 340-349).\n          - Similarly, '8' in the tens place appears 10 times (e.g., 180-189, 280-289, 380-389).\n          - Since there are three hundreds groups (1, 2, 3), the total for '4' in the tens place is 3 * 10 = 30.\n          - Similarly, '8' in the tens place is 3 * 10 = 30.\n\n       3. **Units place:**\n          - For each hundreds group, each tens digit (0-9) will have the units digit cycle through 0-9.\n          - So, for each hundreds group, the digit '4' in the units place appears 10 times per tens digit, but since there are 10 tens digits, it's 10 times per hundreds group.\n          - Wait, no. For each hundreds group, each tens digit from 0-9 has 10 numbers, so for each hundreds group, '4' appears once in the units place for each set of 10 numbers, and there are 10 tens digits, so 10 * 1 = 10 times per hundreds group.\n          - Similarly, '8' appears 10 times in the units place per hundreds group.\n          - Since there are three hundreds groups, '4' appears 3 * 10 = 30 times in the units place.\n          - Similarly, '8' appears 3 * 10 = 30 times in the units place.\n\n       So, summarizing for hundreds digits 1, 2, 3:\n\n       - '4's: 0 (hundreds) + 30 (tens) + 30 (units) = 60 times.\n       - '8's: 0 (hundreds) + 30 (tens) + 30 (units) = 60 times.\n\n       Now, let's add up all the counts from all segments:\n\n       - Single-digit (1-9):\n         - '4's: 1\n         - '8's: 1\n\n       - Two-digit (10-99):\n         - '4's: 19\n         - '8's: 19\n\n       - Three-digit (100-488):\n         - Hundreds digits 1,2,3:\n           - '4's: 60\n           - '8's: 60\n         - Hundreds digit 4:\n           - '4's: 108\n           - '8's: 18\n\n       So, total '4's = 1 + 19 + 60 + 108 = let's compute step by step:\n\n       1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) = 20\n       20 + 60 (hundreds 1-3) = 80\n       80 + 108 (hundreds 4) = 188\n\n       Total '4's: 188\n\n       Total '8's = 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 60 (hundreds 1-3) + 18 (hundreds 4) = \n\n       1 + 19 = 20\n       20 + 60 = 80\n       80 + 18 = 98\n\n       So, '8's: 98\n\n       Now, the difference is '4's - '8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n       Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations, especially for the three-digit numbers.\n\n       Let me recalculate the three-digit counts.\n\n       For hundreds digits 1,2,3:\n\n       - Tens place: '4' appears 10 times per hundreds group, so 3 * 10 = 30.\n       - Units place: '4' appears 10 times per hundreds group, so 3 * 10 = 30.\n       - So, total '4's: 30 + 30 = 60. Correct.\n\n       Similarly, '8's: same calculation, 30 + 30 = 60. Correct.\n\n       For hundreds digit 4:\n\n       - Hundreds place: 89 '4's. Correct.\n       - Tens place: '4' appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. '8' appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. Correct.\n       - Units place: For tens digits 0-7, each contributes 1 '4' and 1 '8' in the units place, so 8 each. For tens digit 8, units digits go up to 8, so '4' appears once (484) and '8' appears once (488). So, '4's: 8 + 1 = 9, '8's: 8 + 1 = 9. Correct.\n\n       So, '4's in hundreds digit 4 group: 89 + 10 + 9 = 108. Correct.\n       '8's: 0 + 9 + 9 = 18. Correct.\n\n       So, adding up all '4's:\n\n       Single:1, two-digit:19, hundreds 1-3:60, hundreds 4:108. Total: 1+19=20, 20+60=80, 80+108=188.\n\n       '8's:\n\n       Single:1, two-digit:19, hundreds 1-3:60, hundreds 4:18. Total:1+19=20, 20+60=80, 80+18=98.\n\n       So, difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n       Hmm, that seems correct, but let me think if I missed anything.\n\n       Wait, in the hundreds digit 4 group, the units place '4's: I think I might have made a mistake there. Let me re-examine.\n\n       When the hundreds digit is 4, and the tens digit is 0-7, each has 10 numbers, so for each, the units digit cycles 0-9, so '4' appears once per tens digit. There are 8 tens digits (0-7), so '4' appears 8 times in the units place from these. Then, when the tens digit is 8, units digits go up to 8, so '4' appears once (484). So, total '4's in units place: 8 +1 =9. Correct.\n\n       Similarly, '8's in units place: 8 times from tens digits 0-7, plus once from tens digit 8, totaling 9. Correct.\n\n       So, that seems right.\n\n       Wait, but another way to calculate the units place '4's in the hundreds digit 4 group is to consider that from 400-488, how many times does '4' appear in the units place?\n\n       Well, for each tens group (400-409, 410-419, etc.), the units digit cycles 0-9. So, in each of these, '4' appears once. How many tens groups are there?\n\n       From 400-488, the tens digits go from 0-8, so 9 tens groups. But wait, when tens digit is 8, the units only go up to 8, so in that group, '4' appears once (484). So, for tens digits 0-7, each has 10 units digits, so '4' appears once each, and for tens digit 8, '4' appears once. So, total '4's in units place: 8*1 +1=9. Correct.\n\n       Similarly for '8's: in each of the tens digits 0-7, '8' appears once in the units place, so 8 times, plus once in the tens digit 8 group (488), so 9 times total. Correct.\n\n       So, I think my counts are accurate.\n\n       Therefore, the total number of '4's is 188, and '8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n       Wait, but let me think again: in the hundreds digit 4 group, the hundreds place contributes 89 '4's, which is correct because from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, each of those has a '4' in the hundreds place, so 89 '4's there.\n\n       Then, in the tens place, '4' appears 10 times (440-449), and '8' appears 9 times (480-488). Correct.\n\n       Units place: '4's:9, '8's:9. Correct.\n\n       So, 89 +10 +9 =108 '4's in the hundreds digit 4 group.\n\n       So, adding up all the '4's:\n\n       Single:1, two-digit:19, hundreds 1-3:60, hundreds 4:108. Total:1+19=20, 20+60=80, 80+108=188.\n\n       '8's:\n\n       Single:1, two-digit:19, hundreds 1-3:60, hundreds 4:18. Total:1+19=20, 20+60=80, 80+18=98.\n\n       So, 188 - 98 =90.\n\n       Therefore, the answer should be 90 more '4's than '8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more '4's are printed than '8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) across single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit page numbers.\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - '4' appears once.\n   - '8' appears once.\n   - Difference: 0.\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** '4' appears 10 times (40-49), '8' appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - **Units place:** '4' appears 9 times, '8' appears 9 times.\n   - Total: '4' = 19, '8' = 19.\n   - Difference: 0.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place (1, 2, 3):** No '4's or '8's.\n   - **Tens place (1, 2, 3):** '4' and '8' each appear 30 times.\n   - **Units place (1, 2, 3):** '4' and '8' each appear 30 times.\n   - **Total for 1-3 in hundreds:** '4' = 60, '8' = 60.\n   - **Hundreds place (4):** '4' appears 89 times.\n   - **Tens place (4):** '4' appears 10 times, '8' appears 9 times.\n   - **Units place (4):** '4' appears 9 times, '8' appears 9 times.\n   - **Total for hundreds 4:** '4' = 108, '8' = 18.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- '4's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 60 (1-3) + 108 (4) = 188.\n- '8's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 60 (1-3) + 18 (4) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I should probably understand how page numbers are structured. Each page number is a number from 1 to 488. So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by thinking about how digits are counted in numbers. I remember that for digit counting, it's helpful to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds, etc. Since 488 is a three-digit number, I'll need to consider each place\u2014units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nI'll tackle each digit place one by one for both 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in the units place as the numbers go from 1 to 488. So, for every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), each digit appears once. \n\nTo find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives me 48 full blocks of 10, and then check the remaining 8 numbers (481-488). \n\nSo, in each block of 10, 4 appears once in the units place. That's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1 through 8. So, 4 appears once more in the units place. So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the units place: Each block of 10 has one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers, 8 appears once (in 488). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSo, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place. Hmm, that's interesting, so they're equal here.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 1 to 488, how many complete decades are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Then, the remaining 8 numbers are 481 to 488, which have units digits 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So yes, 48 +1 =49 each.\n\nSo, units place: 49 fours, 49 eights.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nFor the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every block of 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 ten times each (10-19 have tens digit 1, 20-29 have 2, etc.). \n\nSo, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8.\n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, from 1-400, there are 4 complete hundreds. Then, from 401-488, which is 88 numbers.\n\nSo, in each of the 4 hundreds, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would contribute 4*10=40 fours and 4*10=40 eights.\n\nNow, let's look at the remaining 88 numbers: 401-488.\n\nWait, actually, from 1-488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so the hundreds part is 1,2,3,4. So, in each hundred block, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times, so 10 fours and 10 eights per hundred.\n\nSo, for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10=40 fours and 40 eights.\n\nBut wait, actually, 488 is 4 hundreds, but the last block is 401-488, which is 88 numbers, not a full hundred. So, I need to check if the tens digit in 401-488 contributes any additional fours or eights.\n\nLet me think. From 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8 in the tens place, but let's see:\n\nWait, no. Let me break it down. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but each ten's digit appears 10 times except for the last one, which is 8 and appears 8 times (since 488 is the last number). Wait, no, let me clarify.\n\nActually, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 481-488). So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which is 8, but let's see:\n\nWait, 401-410: tens digit 0, 10 numbers.\n411-420: tens digit 1, 10 numbers.\n...\n471-480: tens digit 7, 10 numbers.\n481-488: tens digit 8, 8 numbers.\n\nSo, in the tens place, from 401-488, the digits 0-7 each appear 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, for 401-488, how many 4's and 8's are there?\n\nLooking for 4's: the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours.\n\nLooking for 8's: the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, so 9 eights.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 481-488 is 8 numbers, but actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, from 401-488, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n\nWait, but 480 is included in 401-488, so yes, 480 is part of that block. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in 480-488.\n\nSo, in the tens place from 401-488, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nTherefore, in the entire book, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 4*10 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50.\n\nSimilarly, the total number of 8's in the tens place is 4*10 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 401-488) = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 hundreds give 40 fours and 40 eights. Then, from 401-488, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total tens place 4's: 40 +10=50, and 8's:40 +9=49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, 8's appear 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nThe hundreds digit is 1,2,3,4 for the numbers 1-488.\n\nIn the hundreds place, each number from 1-9 appears 100 times in a thousand, but since we're only going up to 488, let's see.\n\nThe hundreds digit is 1 from 100-199: 100 numbers, so 100 times 1 in the hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, 2 from 200-299: 100 times.\n\n3 from 300-399: 100 times.\n\n4 from 400-488: 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89).\n\nWait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? 89 times.\n\nHow about 8? The hundreds digit never reaches 8 because the book only has 488 pages. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing 1 four and 1 eight, so 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once, 8 appears once. So, units place: 48+1=49, 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40 each. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449 (10 times) and 8 in 480-488 (9 times). So, 40+10=50 fours, 40+9=49 eights. That adds up correctly.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 appears 0 times. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49+50+89=188. 8's:49+49+0=98. Difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89. So, yes, 89 numbers where the hundreds digit is 4, so 89 fours.\n\nIs there any other place where 8 could appear in the hundreds place? No, because 488 is less than 800, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 eights there.\n\nAnother way to check: Let me consider the total number of digits printed. Each page from 1-9 is a single digit, 10-99 are two digits, and 100-488 are three digits.\n\nWait, but maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, I can check if the counts for each digit make sense.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position again.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- For 488 pages, each digit 0-9 appears equally in the units place except possibly the last incomplete block.\n\nAs calculated, 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing 1 four and 1 eight. Then, the last 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once, 8 appears once. So, 49 each.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 40 each. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449 (10 numbers) and 8 in 480-488 (9 numbers). So, total tens place: 40+10=50 fours, 40+9=49 eights.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly 4 appears 89 times, 8 doesn't appear.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188.\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, so I'm confident the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place (from 1 to 480).\n   - From 481 to 488, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place.\n   - From 1-400: 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 fours and 40 eights.\n   - From 401-488: 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I should understand what the problem is asking. It's about counting the occurrences of the digit '4' and the digit '8' in all the page numbers from 1 to 488. Then, I need to find the difference between the number of 4's and 8's. So, I'll have to count how many times each digit appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers.\n\nLet me start by considering the structure of the page numbers. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. That means the page numbers can be 1-digit (1-9), 2-digit (10-99), or 3-digit (100-488).\n\nI think the best approach is to count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position separately\u2014units, tens, and hundreds. Then, sum them up for each digit and find the difference.\n\nLet me break it down into steps:\n\n1. Count the number of 4's in the units place.\n2. Count the number of 4's in the tens place.\n3. Count the number of 4's in the hundreds place.\n4. Do the same for 8's.\n5. Subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find how many more 4's there are.\n\nStarting with the units place for 4's:\n\nIn the units place, the digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and a partial group of 8 numbers (481-488). In each group of 10, the digit '4' appears exactly once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). So, in 48 complete groups, that's 48 times. Now, in the partial group from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so '4' appears once here as well (484). So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Each group of 10 contributes one '4' in the units place. So, from 1-10: 4; 11-20:14; ... up to 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but actually, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, the last group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in the units place, each group of 10 contributes one '4', and since there are 48 full groups (up to 480), that's 48 '4's, and then in 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so '4' appears once more (484). So yes, 48 + 1 = 49 '4's in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place for '4's:\n\nIn the tens place, '4' appears in a block of 10 numbers every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is '4' for all 10 numbers. So, in each set of 100, there are 10 '4's in the tens place. Now, how many full sets of 100 are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit '4' appears 10 times each. So, 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit '4' appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, 440-449 is fully included because 449 is less than 488. So, that's another 10 '4's. So, total '4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, let me make sure. From 1-100: 40-49, so 10 '4's. From 101-200: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249 and 340-349 each give 10. So that's 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the next set would be 440-449, which is another 10. So, 40 + 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place for '4's:\n\nThe hundreds digit is '4' only in the numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is '4' for all these 89 numbers. Therefore, the number of '4's in the hundreds place is 89.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The hundreds digit is '4' starting at 400. So, from 400 to 499, it's 100 numbers, but since our book ends at 488, it's only up to 488. So, the count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 '4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the '4's:\n\nUnits place: 49\nTens place: 50\nHundreds place: 89\nTotal '4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 49 + 50 = 99, then 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 '4's.\n\nNow, let's do the same for '8's.\n\nStarting with the units place for '8's:\n\nIn the units place, '8' appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does '8' appear in the units place? Each group of 10 contributes one '8'. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full groups and a partial group of 8 numbers (481-488). In each full group, '8' appears once, so 48 times. In the partial group, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so '8' appears once (488). So, total '8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, same as '4's in the units place. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the tens place for '8's:\n\nIn the tens place, '8' appears in a block of 10 numbers every 100 numbers. For example, from 80-89, the tens digit is '8' for all 10 numbers. So, in each set of 100, there are 10 '8's in the tens place. How many full sets of 100 are there in 488? Four full sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 '8's, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial set, 401-488, the tens digit '8' appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, '8' appears 9 times here because the tens digit is '8' for all these numbers. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is '8' for all of them, so that's 9 '8's in the tens place. So, total '8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me double-check. From 1-100: 80-89, 10 '8's. From 101-200: 180-189, another 10. Similarly, 280-289 and 380-389 each give 10. So, that's 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the next set would be 480-488, which is 9 numbers, each with '8' in the tens place. So, 9 '8's. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place for '8's:\n\nThe hundreds digit is '8' only in the numbers from 800 to 899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with '8' in the hundreds place. Therefore, the number of '8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, summing up the '8's:\n\nUnits place: 49\nTens place: 49\nHundreds place: 0\nTotal '8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 '8's.\n\nNow, to find how many more '4's there are than '8's, I subtract the total '8's from the total '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me go through each digit place again for both '4's and '8's.\n\nStarting with '4's:\n\nUnits place: Each group of 10 has one '4', so 48 full groups (1-480) give 48 '4's. Then, in 481-488, units digits go up to 8, so '4' appears once more (484). So, 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 '4's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) give 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the next set is 440-449, which is 10 '4's. So, 40 + 10 = 50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 '4's. Correct.\n\nTotal '4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Correct.\n\nNow, '8's:\n\nUnits place: Each group of 10 has one '8', so 48 full groups (1-480) give 48 '8's. Then, in 481-488, units digits go up to 8, so '8' appears once (488). So, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 '8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) give 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the next set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers with '8' in the tens place. So, 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: None, as the book doesn't reach 800. So, 0. Correct.\n\nTotal '8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in the tens place for '8's? From 401-488, the tens digit '8' appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 '8's. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems right.\n\nSimilarly, for '4's in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit '4' appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 '4's. So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, right? 440, 441, ..., 449. So, yes, 10 '4's in the tens place there.\n\nSo, the counts seem accurate. Therefore, the difference is indeed 90.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe by calculating the total number of digits and seeing if the counts make sense.\n\nTotal pages: 488.\n\nNumber of digits:\n\n- Pages 1-9: 1 digit each, 9 pages, 9 digits.\n- Pages 10-99: 2 digits each, 90 pages, 180 digits.\n- Pages 100-488: 3 digits each, 389 pages, 1167 digits.\n\nTotal digits: 9 + 180 + 1167 = 1356 digits.\n\nNow, the number of '4's is 188 and '8's is 98, so total digits accounted for by '4's and '8's: 188 + 98 = 286. So, 286 out of 1356 digits are either '4's or '8's.\n\nThat seems plausible. Now, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula.\n\nFor counting digits in a range, a common approach is to consider each digit place separately and calculate how many times each digit appears.\n\nFor a given digit place (units, tens, hundreds), the count can be calculated based on higher digits and lower digits.\n\nBut perhaps my initial method is sufficient.\n\nWait, let me try another approach for the units place.\n\nIn the units place, for each digit from 0-9, each digit appears equally often, except possibly the last partial group.\n\nSo, for units place:\n\nTotal numbers: 488.\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: 48, with a remainder of 8.\n\nEach complete group contributes one '4' and one '8' in the units place.\n\nSo, '4's in units: 48 * 1 + min(8, 4 present in 481-488). Since 484 is within 481-488, so +1. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, '8's in units: 48 * 1 + min(8, 8 present in 481-488). 488 is within, so +1. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nThat's consistent with what I had before.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\nEach digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each block of 100.\n\nSo, for '4's in tens place:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds: 4, each contributing 10 '4's in tens place: 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nThen, in the last partial hundred (401-488), how many '4's in the tens place? The tens digit cycles every 100, so in 401-488, the tens digit '4' appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 '4's. So, total '4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for '8's in tens place:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds: 4, each contributing 10 '8's in tens place: 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nIn the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit '8' appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 '8's. So, total '8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\n'4's: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 '4's.\n\n'8's: From 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so 0 '8's.\n\nSo, that's consistent with the earlier counts.\n\nTherefore, the total '4's are 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal '8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more '4's than '8's.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any errors in the reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits '4' and '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding how many more '4's there are than '8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting '4's:**\n   - **Units Place:** Each group of 10 numbers contributes one '4'. There are 48 full groups (1-480) and one partial group (481-488) where '4' appears once. Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** Each hundred contributes 10 '4's. Four full hundreds (1-400) give 40 '4's. The partial hundred (401-488) includes 440-449, adding 10 '4's. Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, there are 89 numbers with '4' in the hundreds place. Total: 89.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting '8's:**\n   - **Units Place:** Each group of 10 contributes one '8'. 48 full groups and one partial group (481-488) where '8' appears once.

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488. Then, I'll do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by understanding how digits are distributed in page numbers. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, pages 1 to 9 are single-digit, 10 to 99 are two-digit, 100 to 488 are three-digit numbers.\n\nI think the best approach is to count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That way, I can systematically go through each place without missing any numbers.\n\nLet's start with the digit 4.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - In the units place, the digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full groups of 10, and then check the remainder. 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so there are 48 full groups and 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n   - Each full group contributes 1 four in the units place, so that's 48 fours.\n   - Now, in the extra numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 is included, which adds another 4 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49 fours in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Let's see how many hundreds are there in 488. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 hundreds give 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 fours.\n   - Now, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in the numbers 440-449. That's another 10 fours.\n   - So, total fours in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - In the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears for pages 400-488. That's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive).\n   - So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the fours:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal fours = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me recount.\n\nWait, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So that's correct. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nHmm, but wait, when I add 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds), that's indeed 188 fours. Okay, that seems correct.\n\n**Now, counting the number of 8's:**\n\nLet me do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to fours, 8 appears once every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1 eight, so 48 eights.\n   - The extra numbers are 481-488. The units digits here go up to 8, so 488 is included, which adds another 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In the tens place, 8 appears 10 times every 100 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-489. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so in the 400s, it's 480-488, which is only 9 numbers (480-488). Hmm, so let me adjust.\n\n   - For each hundred, except the last one, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times. So, in 1-100, 80-89: 10 eights.\n   - Similarly, in 101-200, 180-189: 10 eights.\n   - In 201-300, 280-289: 10 eights.\n   - In 301-400, 380-389: 10 eights.\n   - Now, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480-488), so 9 eights.\n\n   So, total eights in the tens place: 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights here.\n\nAdding up all the eights:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal eights = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so total 98 eights.\n\nWait, but let me make sure about the tens place in the 400s. From 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 40 from the first four hundreds, plus 9, totaling 49. That's correct.\n\nSo, now, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the fours in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the units and tens places, I think I did it right. So, 188 fours and 98 eights.\n\nThus, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of 10 and 8 extra numbers. Each group contributes 1 four, totaling 48 fours. The extra numbers include 484, adding 1 more, so 49 fours.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. In 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449 (10 fours). Additionally, each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) contributes 10 fours in the tens place, totaling 40 fours from the first four hundreds plus 10 from 440-449, making 50 fours.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, contributing 89 fours.\n   - **Total fours:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups and 8 extra numbers, contributing 48 eights. The extra numbers include 488, adding 1 more, totaling 49 eights.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. In each of the first four hundreds, this contributes 10 eights, totaling 40. In 400-488, 480-488 contributes 9 eights, making a total of 49 eights.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total eights:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98 eights.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 90 more times than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once (like page 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for 8 (like page 8, 18, 28, etc.). \n\nNow, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10 and then an extra 8 pages (481-488). In each full group, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for the units place, the count of 4's is 48 times 1, which is 48, and similarly for 8's, it's also 48. \n\nBut wait, there's that extra 8 pages. Let me check pages 481 to 488. The units digits here are 1 through 8. So, in this extra partial group, the digit 4 appears once (page 484), and 8 appears once (page 488). Therefore, the total count for units place is 48 + 1 = 49 for 4's and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8's. Hmm, so in the units place, both digits appear the same number of times. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nNext, moving on to the tens place. Here, the digits cycle every 100 pages. For example, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears from page 40 to 49, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears from page 80 to 89, also 10 times. \n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an extra 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each full hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49), and 8 appears 10 times (80-89). So, for 4 full hundreds, that's 4 times 10 = 40 for both 4's and 8's in the tens place. \n\nNow, looking at the extra 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8 in the tens place. Specifically, from 401-409, the tens digit is 0; 410-419, it's 1; and so on up to 480-488, where the tens digit is 8. \n\nSo, in this extra part, does the tens digit 4 appear? Let's see. The tens digit is 4 in the range 440-449, which is 10 pages. But wait, our extra part is only up to 488, so 440-449 is fully included. So, that's another 10 times for 4's in the tens place. \n\nWhat about 8's in the tens place? That would be 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 pages because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here. \n\nSo, adding this to the previous counts: for 4's in the tens place, it's 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50. For 8's, it's 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49. \n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times, making a difference of 1 more 4 than 8.\n\nNow, onto the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. Wait, actually, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place?\n\nFrom 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nWhat about 8's in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit cycles every 1000, and 8 would be in the hundreds place from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 8's in the hundreds place count is 0.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's are 89 and 8's are 0, making a difference of 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let me add up the differences from each place:\n\n- Units place: 4's - 8's = 49 - 49 = 0\n- Tens place: 50 - 49 = +1\n- Hundreds place: 89 - 0 = +89\n\nSo, total difference is 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the units place: 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) contribute one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4's, and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8's. So, difference is 0. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each full hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's, so 4 hundreds give 40 each. Then, the extra 88 pages: from 401-488. The tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 more 4's. For 8's, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 more 8's. So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's. Difference is +1.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's. 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place, so 0. Difference is +89.\n\nAdding them up: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, yes, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. \n\nAnother check: total number of digits. Let me see, but maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as each digit place contributing separately.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is to calculate the total number of 4's and 8's across all page numbers and then subtract.\n\nBut maybe it's more efficient to proceed as I did before, since I've already broken it down into units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me recount the 4's and 8's in the tens place again. From 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So, when does the tens digit become 4? That's from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 4's in the tens place. For 8's, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 8's. So, yes, 10 vs 9, so 4's have 1 more in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, in the hundreds place, 4's have 89, 8's have 0. So, the difference is 89. \n\nAdding up the differences: units (0) + tens (1) + hundreds (89) = 90. So, the total number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each group of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 full groups of 10, contributing 48 each.\n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) add one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Difference: 49 - 49 = 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each full hundred contributes 10 4's (e.g., 40-49) and 10 8's (e.g., 80-89).\n   - 4 full hundreds contribute 40 each.\n   - The extra 88 pages (401-488) add 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n   - Difference: 50 - 49 = +1.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488, contributing 89 4's.\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89.\n   - Total 8's: 0.\n   - Difference: 89 - 0 = +89.\n\nAdding the differences: 0 (units) + 1 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I should probably understand how page numbers work. Each page from 1 to 488 is printed once, so I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the digits place by place: units place, tens place, hundreds place, etc. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to three digits. So, I'll need to analyze each digit position separately for both 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once (e.g., 4, 14, 24, etc.) and the digit 8 appears once (e.g., 8, 18, 28, etc.). \n\nTo find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide the total number of pages by 10 and take the integer part. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10 pages. Each set contributes one 4, so that's 48 times. But wait, the last set might not be complete. Let me check: the last page is 488, which is the 8th page in the 488th set. So, the units digit cycles up to 8, which means the 48th set ends at 480, and then we have pages 481 to 488. So, in the units place, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1 through 8, which includes a 4 (484) and an 8 (488). So, that's one more 4 and one more 8 in the units place beyond the 48 sets. \n\nTherefore, total 4's in units place: 48 (from the full sets) + 1 (from 484) = 49.\nSimilarly, total 8's in units place: 48 (from the full sets) + 1 (from 488) = 49.\n\nHmm, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each cycle of 100 pages has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49 (10 numbers) and 8 for 80-89 (10 numbers). \n\nSo, for the tens place, the number of 4's and 8's would be similar, but I need to adjust for the total number of pages being 488, which is less than 500. \n\nFirst, let's see how many full hundreds are there. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, for 4 full hundreds: 4 * 10 = 40 4's and 4 * 10 = 40 8's.\n\nNow, the remaining pages are from 401 to 488, which is 88 pages. Let's analyze the tens digit in this range.\n\nFrom 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. Specifically, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). \n\nLet's count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\n- For the tens digit 4: This occurs in pages 440-449. That's 10 pages, so 10 4's.\n- For the tens digit 8: This occurs in pages 480-488. That's 9 pages (480 to 488 inclusive), so 9 8's.\n\nWait, but in the range 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, so 440-449 is within this range, contributing 10 4's. Similarly, 480-488 is within this range, contributing 9 8's because 488 is the last page.\n\nSo, adding this to our previous counts:\n\nTotal 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, there are 50 4's and 49 8's. The difference here is 1.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488.\n\nWait, actually, let me correct that. The hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? It's 89 times because every page from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4. \n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit can't be 8 because the book only has 488 pages. The hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\nTotal 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89.\n\nNow, let's sum up the differences from each digit place:\n\n- Units place: 0 difference\n- Tens place: +1\n- Hundreds place: +89\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check because I might have made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, in the tens place, I had 50 4's and 49 8's, so that's a difference of +1. In the hundreds place, 89 4's and 0 8's, so +89. So, total is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me verify the counts again to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many 4's in units place? For every 10 pages, one 4. So, 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, total 48 +1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in 481-488, units digit 8 appears once (488). So, 48 +1 =49. So, units place: 49 each, difference 0.\n\nTens place:\n\nFrom 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in tens place?\n\n- 0-99: 40-49, which is 10 pages, so 10 4's.\n- 100-199: 140-149, another 10.\n- 200-299: 240-249, another 10.\n- 300-399: 340-349, another 10.\n- 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 pages.\n\nWait, so that's 10 * 5 =50? Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, yes, 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 50 4's.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in tens place:\n\n- 0-99: 80-89, 10 pages.\n- 100-199: 180-189, 10.\n- 200-299: 280-289, 10.\n- 300-399: 380-389, 10.\n- 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 pages (since 488 is the last page).\n\nSo, 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 =49 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, tens place: 50 4's and 49 8's, difference +1.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears in hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 -400 +1 =89). So, 89 4's.\n\n8 never appears in hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, 0 8's.\n\nSo, hundreds place: 89 4's, 0 8's, difference +89.\n\nAdding up the differences: 0 (units) +1 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 -400 +1 =89. So, yes, 89 times 4 appears in hundreds place.\n\nAnother way to think about it: The hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's.\n\nAnd since the book doesn't go beyond 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so 0 8's there.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 +50=99 +89=188.\n\nTotal 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) =49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference was 90, but when I added up the differences per digit, it was 0+1+89=90, which matches.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't miss any 8's in the hundreds place. Since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit is 4, so no 8's there. So, yes, 0 8's in hundreds place.\n\nAnother way to think about it: The hundreds digit can only be 0,1,2,3,4 in this case. So, 8 never appears there.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. The total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me cross-verify the total counts again.\n\nTotal 4's:\n\nUnits: 49\nTens:50\nHundreds:89\nTotal:49+50=99+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n\nUnits:49\nTens:49\nHundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Then, I'll do the same for the digit 8 and find the difference between the two counts. That should give me the answer.\n\nLet me start by understanding how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 up to 488. So, the page numbers are from 1 to 488 inclusive.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to break down the counting based on the number of digits. So, I'll consider one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit page numbers separately. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each category and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with one-digit page numbers: these are from 1 to 9. So, how many 4's are there? Well, only one, which is page 4. Similarly, how many 8's? Only one, which is page 8. So, in one-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear once each. That means, so far, the count is 1 for 4 and 1 for 8, so the difference is 0.\n\nNext, moving on to two-digit page numbers: these are from 10 to 99. Now, I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place and the units place separately.\n\nLet's start with the digit 4. In the tens place, the numbers would be 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. In the units place, the digit 4 appears in numbers like 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but since we're only considering up to 488, but for two-digit numbers, it's up to 99. So, from 10 to 99, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so from 10-19: 14, 20-29:24, and so on until 90-99:94. That's 9 times, right? Wait, no, actually, from 10 to 99, there are 9 decades (10-19, 20-29,...,90-99), so 9 times in the units place. But wait, 44 has two 4's, but I'm counting each occurrence, so 44 would contribute two 4's. Wait, but I'm counting the number of times 4 appears in each position. So, for the units place, each decade has one 4, so 9 decades would give 9 times, but wait, from 10 to 99, that's 90 numbers, so 9 decades. So, 9 times in the units place. But wait, 40-49 is 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so 10 times in the tens place. So, total 4's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the units place, from 10 to 99, the digit 4 appears once in each ten's group, so 9 times. But wait, 40-49 is a special case where the tens digit is 4, but the units digit can also be 4 in 44. So, maybe I should calculate it as:\n\nFor the tens place in two-digit numbers: 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times the digit 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nFor the units place: in each ten's group (10-19, 20-29,...,90-99), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 10-19:14, 20-29:24, ..., 90-99:94. That's 9 times, but wait, 40-49 is included in this as 44. So, actually, from 10 to 99, the units digit 4 appears 9 times, but wait, 40-49 is part of the two-digit numbers, so 44 is included in both the tens and units counts.\n\nWait, but I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me just count the units digit 4's in two-digit numbers: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 9 times. But 44 has two 4's, so does that mean I should count it as two? No, because I'm counting each occurrence. So, in the units place, 44 contributes one 4, same as the others. So, 9 times in the units place, and 10 times in the tens place, so total 19 times for 4 in two-digit numbers.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in two-digit numbers:\n\nIn the tens place: 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times the digit 8 appears in the tens place.\n\nIn the units place: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 9 times in the units place, and 10 times in the tens place, so total 19 times for 8 in two-digit numbers.\n\nWait, but 88 has two 8's, so does that affect the count? No, because I'm counting each occurrence. So, in the units place, 88 contributes one 8, same as the others. So, 9 times in the units place, 10 in the tens, total 19.\n\nSo, in two-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear 19 times each. So, so far, total counts are:\n\n4's: 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) = 20\n\n8's: 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) = 20\n\nSo, difference so far is 0.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: from 100 to 488.\n\nThis is where it gets a bit more complicated because the range isn't a full set of three-digit numbers (100-999), but only up to 488. So, I need to be careful with the upper limit.\n\nLet me break down the three-digit numbers into hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, since we're going up to 488.\n\nBut wait, 488 is the last page, so the hundreds digit goes from 1 to 4.\n\nI think I should handle the hundreds place, tens place, and units place separately for each digit.\n\nLet me start with the hundreds place:\n\nFor the digit 4 in the hundreds place: numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nFor the digit 8 in the hundreds place: but wait, the hundreds digit can only be 1,2,3,4. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all in three-digit numbers up to 488. So, 0 times for 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nFor the digit 4 in the tens place: we need to consider how many times 4 appears in the tens digit across all three-digit numbers up to 488.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place.\n\nLet me handle 4 first.\n\nIn the tens place, the digit 4 can appear in the following ranges:\n\n- 100-199: the tens digit is 4 in 140-149, which is 10 numbers.\n\n- 200-299: similarly, 240-249, 10 numbers.\n\n- 300-399: 340-349, 10 numbers.\n\n- 400-488: the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers.\n\nWait, but 488 is the upper limit, so 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, total for 4 in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 +10 = 40 times.\n\nWait, but let me check. From 100-199: 140-149 is 10 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 4 times 10 is 40.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place:\n\nIn the tens place, 8 can appear in:\n\n- 100-199: 180-189, 10 numbers.\n\n- 200-299: 280-289, 10 numbers.\n\n- 300-399: 380-389, 10 numbers.\n\n- 400-488: 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. Wait, 480-488 is from 480 to 488, inclusive. So, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total for 8 in the tens place: 10 +10 +10 +9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nFrom 100-199: 180-189 is 10 numbers.\n\n200-299: 280-289:10\n\n300-399:380-389:10\n\n400-488:480-488:9 numbers.\n\nSo, total 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, 4 appears 40 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 39 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place.\n\nFor the digit 4 in the units place:\n\nIn each hundred, the units digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the units place.\n\nBut since we're only going up to 488, I need to check if the last hundred (400-488) has a complete set.\n\nSo, let's break it down:\n\n- 100-199: units digit 4 appears in 104,114,124,134,144,154,164,174,184,194: 10 times.\n\n- 200-299: similarly, 204,214,...,294:10 times.\n\n- 300-399: 304,314,...,394:10 times.\n\n- 400-488: units digit 4 appears in 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. Wait, but 484 is within 488, so that's 9 numbers, but wait, 400-488 includes 404,414,...,484. Let me count: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484: that's 9 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the units place.\n\nWait, but from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 404,414,...,484. The next one would be 494, but that's beyond 488, so we stop at 484. So, how many numbers is that? Let's see: 404 is the first, then 414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers, right? Because 404 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So, 404 +10*(n-1)=484 \u2192 10*(n-1)=80 \u2192 n-1=8 \u2192 n=9. So, 9 times.\n\nSo, total for 4 in the units place: 10 (100-199) +10 (200-299)+10 (300-399)+9 (400-488)=39 times.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place:\n\nIn each hundred, units digit 8 appears in 108,118,...,198:10 times.\n\n200-299:208,218,...,298:10 times.\n\n300-399:308,318,...,398:10 times.\n\n400-488:408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488.\n\nWait, 408 is within 400-488, so let's count how many:\n\n408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488.\n\nThat's 9 numbers, right? Because 408 is the first, then each 10 numbers up to 488.\n\nWait, 408 +10*(n-1)=488 \u2192 10*(n-1)=80 \u2192 n-1=8 \u2192 n=9.\n\nSo, 9 numbers.\n\nThus, total for 8 in the units place:10+10+10+9=39 times.\n\nWait, but let me confirm:\n\n100-199:108,118,...,198:10 numbers.\n\n200-299:208,...,298:10.\n\n300-399:308,...,398:10.\n\n400-488:408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488:9 numbers.\n\nSo, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, for the units place, 4 appears 39 times and 8 appears 39 times.\n\nWait, but earlier, for the units place of 4, I had 10+10+10+9=39, and for 8, same.\n\nSo, summarizing three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\n- Tens place: 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\n- Units place: 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\nSo, total for three-digit numbers:\n\n4's: 89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (units)=168 times.\n\n8's: 0 (hundreds) +39 (tens) +39 (units)=78 times.\n\nWait, let me check that addition:\n\n89 +40=129, 129+39=168.\n\nAnd 0+39=39, 39+39=78.\n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, 4 appears 168 times, and 8 appears 78 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the digits from one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nFrom one-digit and two-digit:\n\n4's:1 +19=20\n\n8's:1 +19=20\n\nFrom three-digit:\n\n4's:168\n\n8's:78\n\nSo, total 4's:20 +168=188\n\nTotal 8's:20 +78=98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with one-digit numbers:\n\n4 appears once (page 4), 8 appears once (page 8).\n\nTwo-digit numbers:\n\n4's:10 (tens) +9 (units)=19\n\n8's:10 (tens) +9 (units)=19\n\nSo, 4's:1+19=20, 8's:1+19=20.\n\nThree-digit numbers:\n\nHundreds place:4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 appears 0.\n\nTens place:4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39.\n\nUnits place:4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39.\n\nSo, 4's:89+40+39=168\n\n8's:0+39+39=78\n\nTotal 4's:20+168=188\n\nTotal 8's:20+78=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but I want to make sure I didn't double-count or miss any numbers.\n\nWait, let me check the three-digit counts again.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 400 to 488: that's 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4 in tens place:\n\n100-199:140-149:10\n\n200-299:240-249:10\n\n300-399:340-349:10\n\n400-488:440-449:10\n\nTotal:40.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in tens place:\n\n100-199:180-189:10\n\n200-299:280-289:10\n\n300-399:380-389:10\n\n400-488:480-488:9\n\nTotal:39.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFor 4:\n\n100-199:10\n\n200-299:10\n\n300-399:10\n\n400-488:9\n\nTotal:39.\n\nSimilarly for 8:\n\n100-199:10\n\n200-299:10\n\n300-399:10\n\n400-488:9\n\nTotal:39.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:20 (from 1-99) +168 (from 100-488)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:20 (from 1-99)+78=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot. Let me think if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately using a formula.\n\nFor a given digit d, the number of times it appears in a range from 1 to N can be calculated by considering each digit place (units, tens, hundreds, etc.) separately.\n\nBut since N is 488, which is a three-digit number, I can apply the formula for each digit place.\n\nLet me try this approach for both 4 and 8.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of 4's.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nWe can divide the problem into higher digits and current digit.\n\nFor units place:\n\nThe number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488.\n\nWe can calculate this by looking at complete groups of 10.\n\nEach complete group of 10 (e.g., 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place.\n\nSo, from 1 to 480, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 480/10=48 groups.\n\nSo, 48 times 4 appears in the units place from 1-480.\n\nThen, from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so no additional 4's.\n\nSo, total units place 4's:48.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 39. Hmm, discrepancy here. Wait, which is correct?\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me check.\n\nIn the units place, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, starting from 4,14,24,...,484.\n\nSo, how many such numbers?\n\nThe first is 4, then 14,24,...,484.\n\nThe last one is 484.\n\nSo, how many terms are there?\n\nThe sequence is 4,14,24,...,484.\n\nThis is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 10.\n\nThe nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484.\n\nSo, 4 +10(n-1)=484 \u219210(n-1)=480\u2192n-1=48\u2192n=49.\n\nSo, 49 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 39. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, in the previous approach, I broke it down into hundreds:\n\n100-199:10\n\n200-299:10\n\n300-399:10\n\n400-488:9\n\nTotal:39.\n\nBut according to this, it's 49 times. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, the mistake is that in the hundreds breakdown, I considered only three-digit numbers, but the units digit 4 also appears in one-digit and two-digit numbers.\n\nWait, no, in the previous approach, I had separated one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, let's clarify:\n\nIn the initial approach, I considered one-digit (1-9), two-digit (10-99), and three-digit (100-488).\n\nIn the units place for 4's:\n\nOne-digit: page 4:1\n\nTwo-digit:14,24,...,94:9\n\nThree-digit:104,114,...,484: let's see how many.\n\nFrom 100-199:104,114,...,194:10\n\n200-299:204,...,294:10\n\n300-399:304,...,394:10\n\n400-488:404,414,...,484:9\n\nSo, total in three-digit:10+10+10+9=39\n\nThen, one-digit:1, two-digit:9, three-digit:39.\n\nTotal units place 4's:1+9+39=49.\n\nWait, so in the initial approach, I had 39 in three-digit, but I forgot to add the one-digit and two-digit units place 4's. So, that's where the discrepancy was.\n\nWait, no, in the initial approach, I had:\n\nFor three-digit numbers, units place 4's:39.\n\nBut in the initial approach, I had:\n\nFrom one-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:9\n\nThree-digit:39\n\nSo, total units place 4's:1+9+39=49.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place:\n\nIn the initial approach, I had:\n\nTwo-digit tens place 4's:10\n\nThree-digit tens place 4's:40\n\nSo, total tens place 4's:10+40=50.\n\nSimilarly, hundreds place 4's:89.\n\nSo, total 4's:89 (hundreds) +50 (tens) +49 (units)=188.\n\nSimilarly for 8's:\n\nUnits place:\n\nOne-digit:1 (page 8)\n\nTwo-digit:18,28,...,98:9\n\nThree-digit:108,118,...,488: let's see.\n\nFrom 100-199:108,118,...,198:10\n\n200-299:208,...,298:10\n\n300-399:308,...,398:10\n\n400-488:408,418,...,488:9\n\nSo, three-digit units place 8's:10+10+10+9=39\n\nTotal units place 8's:1 (one-digit)+9 (two-digit)+39 (three-digit)=49.\n\nTens place 8's:\n\nTwo-digit tens place:10 (80-89)\n\nThree-digit tens place:39 (as calculated earlier)\n\nSo, total tens place 8's:10+39=49.\n\nHundreds place 8's:0.\n\nSo, total 8's:0 (hundreds)+49 (tens)+49 (units)=98.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, 8's:98, difference 90.\n\nWait, so the initial approach was correct, but when I tried to calculate units place 4's as 39, that was only for three-digit numbers. The total units place 4's are 49, which includes one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit.\n\nBut in the initial approach, I had correctly separated the counts, so the total 4's were 188 and 8's 98, difference 90.\n\nBut when I tried the alternative approach using the formula, I realized that units place 4's are 49, which aligns with the initial approach.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first thought of the units place, I thought of 488 as the upper limit, and using the formula, I got 49 units place 4's, which matches the initial approach.\n\nSo, I think the initial calculation is correct, and the difference is indeed 90.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm once more.\n\nTotal 4's:188\n\nTotal 8's:98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - One-digit: 1 (page 4)\n   - Two-digit: 9 (14, 24, ..., 94)\n   - Three-digit: 39 (104, 114, ..., 484)\n   - Total: 1 + 9 + 39 = 49\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Two-digit: 10 (40-49)\n   - Three-digit: 40 (140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449)\n   - Total: 10 + 40 = 50\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Three-digit: 89 (400-488)\n   - Total: 89\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - One-digit: 1 (page 8)\n   - Two-digit: 9 (18, 28, ..., 98)\n   - Three-digit: 39 (108, 118, ..., 488)\n   - Total: 1 + 9 + 39 = 49\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Two-digit: 10 (80-89)\n   - Three-digit: 39 (180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488)\n   - Total: 10 + 39 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - None, as the hundreds digit ranges from 1 to 4.\n   - Total: 0\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should understand how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times 8 appears, and then find the difference between those two counts.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each place and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every set of ten consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does the digit 8. For example, from 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, 4 appears once, and 8 appears once.\n\nNow, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten, and then an extra 8 pages (from 481 to 488). So, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 times 1 (from each set) plus any additional 4's in the extra pages. Similarly for 8's.\n\nWait, let me check that. From 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of ten. Each set contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 times 1 is 48 for both 4's and 8's. Now, the extra pages are 481 to 488, which are 8 pages. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in these extra pages, the units digit 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's, 48 + 1 = 49. So, so far, in the units place, both digits appear 49 times each.\n\nMoving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (40-49), and the same for 8 (80-89). Each occurrence contributes 10 times the digit in the tens place.\n\nSo, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, meaning there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an extra 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49) and 8 appears 10 times (80-89). So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 times 10 = 40 for both 4's and 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the extra 88 pages are from 401 to 488. Let's break this down. The tens digit in this range goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488. Wait, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, right? Because 480 is the first, then 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, that's 9 numbers, meaning the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the extra 88 pages.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. The extra pages are from 401 to 488, which is 88 pages. The tens digit cycles every 10, so from 401-410, tens digit is 0; 411-420, tens digit is 1; and so on up to 480-488, where the tens digit is 8. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. The digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place for the extra 88 pages, 4's occur 10 times, and 8's occur 9 times.\n\nTherefore, total number of 4's in the tens place is 40 (from the complete hundreds) + 10 (from the extra) = 50. And the total number of 8's in the tens place is 40 (from the complete hundreds) + 9 (from the extra) = 49.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 hundreds give 4*10=40 for both. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more 4's. The tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more 8's. So, yes, 40+10=50 for 4's and 40+9=49 for 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4, right? So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is either 1, 2, 3, or 4. Therefore, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nWait, let me make sure. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all because the book doesn't go beyond 488. So, 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences of 4's and 8's across units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- From 1-480: 48 sets of ten, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each.\n- From 481-488: units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both.\n\nTens place:\n- From 1-400: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 40 each.\n- From 401-488: tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449 (10 times), and tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488 (9 times).\n- So, total tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 400-488: 89 pages, so 89 4's.\n- 8's: 0.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each set of ten numbers (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) has one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of ten in 480 pages, contributing 48 each.\n   - Pages 481-488 add one more 4 (at 484) and one more 8 (at 488).\n   - **Total 4's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n   - **Total 8's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contains ten numbers where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49) and ten where it's 8 (e.g., 80-89).\n   - Four complete hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 each.\n   - Pages 401-488:\n     - Tens digit 4: 440-449 (10 numbers).\n     - Tens digit 8: 480-488 (9 numbers).\n   - **Total 4's in tens place:** 40 + 10 = 50\n   - **Total 8's in tens place:** 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have the hundreds digit as 4, occurring 89 times.\n   - No page has 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 4's in hundreds place:** 89\n   - **Total 8's in hundreds place:** 0\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should understand how page numbers are structured. Each page number is a three-digit number, right? Wait, no, actually, page 1 is just 1, page 10 is 10, so pages can be one, two, or three digits. So, I guess I need to consider all the digits in each page number from 1 to 488.\n\nThe problem is asking how many more 4's are there than 8's. So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears, then subtract the two counts to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the counting into units, tens, and hundreds places separately. That might make it easier.\n\nFirst, I'll consider each digit place one by one: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits go from 1 to 0. So, in each block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. \n\nWait, but page 1 is 1, so the first block is 1-10, the next is 11-20, and so on. So, in each block of 10, each digit appears once in the units place. But for the last block, it might not be a full 10 pages if the total number isn't a multiple of 10. But 488 is 488, which is 48 full tens (480) plus 8 more pages. So, the last block is 481-488.\n\nSo, for the units place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in units place: Each full block of 10 contributes one 4. So, from 1 to 480, there are 48 blocks of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. Then, in the last block, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 4 appear in the units place here? Yes, at 484. So that's one more 4. So total 48 + 1 = 49 times 4 appears in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the units place: Each full block of 10 contributes one 8. So, 48 times. Then, in the last block, 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included. So, 488 has an 8 in the units place. So that's one more, making it 48 + 1 = 49 times 8 appears in the units place.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so in the units place, from 1 to 488, how many 8's? Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 478, 488. So, that's 49 times. Similarly, 4's in units place: 4, 14, 24, ..., 474, 484. So, that's 49 times. So, units place: both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. So, so far, the count is 49 each, so the difference is zero.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, the digits cycle every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred.\n\nSo, from 1 to 400, there are four hundreds, each contributing 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for 4, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Similarly, for 8, it's 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\nBut wait, we're going up to 488, so beyond 400, we have 401-488. Let's see how the tens digit behaves here.\n\nFrom 401-410: tens digit is 0.\n411-420: tens digit is 1.\n...\n481-490: tens digit is 8, but we only go up to 488, so in 481-488, the tens digit is 8 for 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 for 8 pages.\n\nSo, for the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times. So, total for 4's in tens place: from 1-400, 40 times. From 401-488, does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see: 440-449 would have 4 in the tens place, but 440 is beyond 488? Wait, no, 440 is within 488, so from 440-449, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 pages. So, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total for 4's in tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50 times.\n\nFor 8's in tens place: from 1-400, 40 times. From 401-488, 8 times as discussed. So total 40 + 8 = 48 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 48 times. So, the difference here is 50 - 48 = 2 more 4's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, the digits go from 1 to 4, since the book has 488 pages. So, pages 1-99 have no hundreds digit, pages 100-499 have hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nWait, no, up to 488, so hundreds digits are 1, 2, 3, and 4 (since 400-488 is included).\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nNow, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the counts because that seems like a big difference, and I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4's, from 440-449, that's 10 times, plus the 40 from 1-400, so 50 times. For 8's, in the tens place, from 1-400, it's 40 times, and from 401-488, it's 8 times, so 48 times. That seems right.\n\nUnits place: both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So, adding up, 4's total is 49 + 50 + 89 = 188, and 8's is 49 + 48 + 0 = 97. So, 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. From 1 to 488, how many 4's in the units place? Let's see: every 10 pages, so 4,14,24,...,474,484. So, how many terms? The first term is 4, the last term is 484, which is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, n-1 = (484 -4)/10 = 480/10=48, so n=49. So, 49 times. Similarly for 8's: 8,18,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, (n-1)*10 = 480, so n-1=48, n=49. So, both 49 times. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4's: from 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 hundreds would be 40. Then, from 401-488, 440-449 is 10 more, so total 50. For 8's, from 1-400, 40 times, and from 401-488, 481-488 is 8 times, so 48. That seems right.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me see if I can find another way to calculate this, maybe by considering each digit place separately and adding up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a systematic approach.\n\nAnother approach: for each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\nAs before, from 1 to N, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place is floor((N)/10) + (1 if (N % 10) >= d else 0).\n\nWait, but actually, for the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears floor(N/10) times, plus an extra 1 if the remainder is >= the digit.\n\nBut since we're starting from 1, not 0, the first page is 1, so 0 doesn't appear in the units place until page 10. So, maybe it's better to adjust for that.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that for the units digit, the count for digit d (where d \u2260 0) is floor((N + 10 - d)/10). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for units digit, the number of times 4 appears is equal to the number of complete decades (each of 10 pages) plus whether the last partial decade includes 4 in the units place.\n\nSo, for 488 pages:\n\nNumber of complete decades: 488 // 10 = 48.\n\nEach complete decade contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48 times.\n\nThen, check the last partial decade: 481-488. The units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (at 484).\n\nSo total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial decade, 8 appears once (at 488). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSame as before.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nEach hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place.\n\nSo, for 488 pages, how many full hundreds? 4 full hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10 times for 4 in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8.\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488).\n\nSo, for 4 in the tens place, it's when the tens digit is 4, which is 440-449. That's 10 pages, so 10 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place:\n\nFrom 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 times, so 4*10=40.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for pages 481-488, which is 8 pages.\n\nSo, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor 4's in hundreds place: pages 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, 89 times.\n\nFor 8's in hundreds place: since the book only goes up to 488, there are no pages where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but I'm getting 91 as the difference, but I'm wondering if that's correct because 91 seems quite high. Let me check another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the total number of 4's and 8's separately and see if the difference is indeed 91.\n\nCalculating total 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49\nTens place: 50\nHundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49\nTens place: 48\nHundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nWait, another way: for each digit place, calculate the count for 4 and 8.\n\nUnits place:\n\nAs before, 49 each.\n\nTens place:\n\n4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 48 times.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Maybe I was just overthinking, but I think 91 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but wait a second, let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, right? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, each of those pages has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times. That's correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 8 pages (481-488), so that's 8 times. So, 48 times in total for 8's in tens place.\n\nSo, yeah, I think 91 is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to see if my method works.\n\nSuppose we have a 20-page book. Let's count how many 4's and 8's.\n\nPages 1-20.\n\n4's: units place: 4,14 \u2192 2 times.\n\nTens place: 40-49, but we only go up to 20, so no 4's in tens place.\n\nHundreds place: none, since it's a 20-page book.\n\nSo, total 4's: 2.\n\n8's: units place: 8,18 \u2192 2 times.\n\nTens place: 80-89, but we only go up to 20, so none.\n\nHundreds place: none.\n\nSo, total 8's: 2.\n\nDifference: 2 - 2 = 0.\n\nUsing my method:\n\nUnits place: 20 // 10 = 2, so 2 4's and 2 8's.\n\nTens place: 20 // 100 = 0 full hundreds, so 0 for both.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 2, 8's: 2. Difference 0. Correct.\n\nAnother example: 40 pages.\n\n4's:\n\nUnits: 4,14,24,34 \u2192 4 times.\n\nTens: 40-49, but since we're at 40, 40 is included. So, tens digit 4 appears 1 time (40-49, but only 40 is within 40 pages). Wait, no, 40 is the 40th page, so from 40-40, so 1 time.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, from 1-40, how many times does 4 appear? From 40-49, but 40 is the only page in 40. So, 1 time.\n\nSo, total 4's: 4 (units) + 1 (tens) = 5.\n\n8's:\n\nUnits: 8,18,28,38 \u2192 4 times.\n\nTens: 80-89, but we only go up to 40, so none.\n\nSo, total 8's: 4.\n\nDifference: 5 - 4 = 1.\n\nUsing my method:\n\nUnits place: 40 // 10 = 4, so 4 4's and 4 8's.\n\nTens place: 40 // 100 = 0 full hundreds, so 0 for both.\n\nBut wait, from 1-40, the tens digit 4 appears once (40). So, perhaps my method isn't capturing that correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps my method needs adjustment for the tens place when the upper limit is not a multiple of 100.\n\nWait, in the tens place, the number of times a digit d appears is calculated as:\n\nNumber of full hundreds * 10 + (if the remaining pages include the tens digit d, then add the count).\n\nWait, in the case of 40 pages, for the tens digit 4:\n\nFull hundreds: 0 (since 40 < 100), so 0 * 10 = 0.\n\nThen, in the remaining pages (1-40), the tens digit 4 appears from 40-40, which is 1 page.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 0 + 1 = 1.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place: 0 + 0 = 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (4) + tens (1) = 5.\n\nTotal 8's: units (4) + tens (0) = 4.\n\nDifference: 1.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nSo, in the original problem, the method seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's, so the answer is \\boxed{91}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we need to count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 471-480) and a partial decade (481-488).\n   - The digit 4 appears in the units place 49 times (48 times in full decades and once in the partial decade).\n   - The digit 8 appears in the units place 49 times (48 times in full decades and once in the partial decade).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 4 full centuries (1-100, 101-200, ..., 301-400) and a partial century (401-488).\n   - The digit 4 appears in the tens place 50 times (40 times in full centuries and 10 times in the partial century from 440-449).\n   - The digit 8 appears in the tens place 48 times (40 times in full centuries and 8 times in the partial century from 481-488).\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 times.\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book only goes up to page 488.\n\nSummarizing the counts:\n- **4's:** Units (49) + Tens (50) + Hundreds (89) = 188\n- **8's:** Units (49) + Tens (48) + Hundreds (0) = 97\n\nThe difference between the number of 4's and 8's is:\n\\[ 188 - 97 = 91 \\]\n\nThus, the number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{91}\n\\]"

So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). In each group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.). So, 48 groups would give 48 fours. Now, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. The digit 4 appears once here (484). So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- **Tens place:**\n  The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each group of 100 has 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 4 complete hundreds in 488 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so 4 groups. Each group contributes 10 fours, so 4*10 = 40. Now, the last partial hundred is 401-488. In the tens place, from 401-409, the tens digit is 0, so no fours. From 410-488, the tens digit cycles again. Wait, actually, from 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10 fours. So total tens place fours: 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 10 (from 400-488) = 50.\n\nWait, hold on, let me double-check that. Each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place. From 1-100, the tens digits are 0-9, so 40-49 gives 10 fours. Similarly, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Since there are 488 pages, which is 4 full hundreds (1-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). So, for the tens place, in each of the first four hundreds, we have 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0 (401-409), 1 (410-419), ..., up to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n- **Hundreds place:**\n  The hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, the count is 89. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours.\n\nNow, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, 4's in units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but wait, 488 is a 3-digit number, so the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 onwards. So, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours there. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let me check the tens place again. Each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 hundreds (1-400) give 40 fours. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So, total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus in the last group (481-488), units digit is 4 once (484), so 49 total. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**2. Counting the number of 8's:**\n\nNow, I'll do the same for the digit 8.\n\n- **Units place:**\n  Similar to the 4's, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of 10 and 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each group of 10, the digit 8 appears once in the units place (like 8, 18, 28, etc.). So, 48 groups give 48 eights. In the last partial group, units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (488). So, total units place eights: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- **Tens place:**\n  The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each group of 100 has 10 occurrences of the digit 8 in the tens place (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are 4 complete hundreds in 488, so 4 groups, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10 = 40. Now, the last partial hundred is 401-488. The tens digit in 401-488 goes from 0 to 8. So, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since our book ends at 488, it's 480-488. So, that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. Wait, no, 480 has tens digit 8, 481 has 8, up to 488, so that's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, total tens place eights: 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me confirm. Each hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, 1-100: 80-89 (10 eights). Similarly, 101-200: 180-189 (10 eights). 201-300: 280-289 (10 eights). 301-400: 380-389 (10 eights). So, that's 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n- **Hundreds place:**\n  The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8 in this book. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me double-check:\n\nUnits place: 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48. Plus in the last 8 numbers (481-488), units digit 8 appears once (488). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**3. Calculating the difference:**\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But let me check again, maybe I overcounted somewhere.\n\nWait, in the tens place for 4's, I had 50. Let me check that again. Each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 hundreds give 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So, 40 + 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's, in the tens place, 4 hundreds give 40 eights, and in 401-488, it's 480-488, which is 9 eights. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 48 full groups (48*1=48) plus 1 in the last group (484), so 49.\n\nUnits place for 8's: 48 full groups plus 1 in the last group (488), so 49.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nHundreds place for 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a big difference. Let me think if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write a small table to count the occurrences.\n\nBut considering that 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 times, that's a significant contribution. The 8's don't appear in the hundreds place at all, so that's a big factor.\n\nLet me see:\n\n- 4's: 89 in hundreds, 50 in tens, 49 in units = 188.\n\n- 8's: 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should understand the problem clearly. Each page from 1 to 488 is printed once, and I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nAlright, so maybe I should start by counting the number of 4's and 8's separately and then compare them. Let me think about how to approach this systematically. I remember that when counting digits in a range of numbers, it's helpful to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds, etc.\n\nSince the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the digits we're dealing with can be in the units place, tens place, or hundreds place. Let me break it down by each place.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 also appears once.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and an extra 8 numbers (since 48*10=480, and then 481 to 488 are the remaining 8 numbers). \n\nSo, in each complete block of 10, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Therefore, for 48 blocks, the number of 4's in the units place is 48, and the same for 8's, which is also 48.\n\nNow, let's check the remaining 8 numbers from 481 to 488. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in these, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). So, adding these to our previous counts, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's, which is 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, no, hold on. Wait, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1 through 8, so 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So, yes, adding 1 to each count. So, units place gives us 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every block of 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), then 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), and so on up to 9 (90-99). Each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, how many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a remaining block of 88 numbers (401-488).\n\nIn each complete block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49 in the first block, 140-149 in the second, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for each of the 4 complete blocks, that's 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. Therefore, for 4 blocks, that's 4*10 = 40 4's and 40 8's.\n\nNow, let's check the remaining 88 numbers from 401 to 488. The tens digit here ranges from 0 to 8. Let's break it down:\n\n- From 401 to 410: tens digit is 0\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit here is 8, but only for 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so the digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place, but wait, no, in the tens place, it's the second digit, so for example, 481 has 8 in the tens place, 482 has 8, etc., up to 488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place here? It's 8 times, but wait, 488 is included, which is 488, so the tens digit is 8, so from 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. Wait, but 480 is included in the previous block, right? Because 480 is the end of the 401-488 range? Wait, no, 401-488 is 88 numbers, so 401 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, 480 would be included in 401-488, but wait, 401-488 is from 401 to 488, so 480 is within that range. Wait, but 480 is actually 4-8-0, so in the tens place, it's 8, but 480 is part of the 401-488 range.\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me approach it differently. From 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles through 0 to 8. Let's see:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0\n- 411-420: tens digit 1\n- 421-430: tens digit 2\n- 431-440: tens digit 3\n- 441-450: tens digit 4\n- 451-460: tens digit 5\n- 461-470: tens digit 6\n- 471-480: tens digit 7\n- 481-488: tens digit 8\n\nWait, but 480 is part of the 471-480 group, which is 10 numbers: 471-480. So, in the 481-488 group, that's only 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place in the remaining 88 numbers?\n\nLooking at the groups:\n\n- 481-488: tens digit 8, 8 numbers, so 8 times.\n\nSo, in the remaining 88 numbers, the digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, how about the digit 4 in the tens place? It appears in the group 441-450, which is 10 numbers: 441, 442, ..., 450. So, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. Therefore, in the remaining 88 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, adding this to our previous counts:\n\n- For 4's in the tens place: 4 blocks * 10 = 40, plus 10 in the remaining 88, so total 50.\n- For 8's in the tens place: 4 blocks * 10 = 40, plus 8 in the remaining 88, so total 48.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. For 8's, it's in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times. So, yes, 10 for 4's and 8 for 8's.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 40 (from blocks) + 10 = 50.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 (from blocks) + 8 = 48.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is the third digit from the right, so for numbers 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0. From 100-199, it's 1, 200-299 it's 2, 300-399 it's 3, and 400-488 it's 4.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, the count for 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, summarizing the hundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nNow, let's add up all the occurrences for each digit.\n\nFirst, for the digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate that. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, okay.\n\nNow for the digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nWait, so 4's total 188, 8's total 97. So, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because 188 seems high for 4's, and 97 for 8's. Let me go through each place again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many 4's in units place? As we calculated, 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in the last partial block (481-488), 484 has a 4 in units place, so 1 more. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: same logic, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4's, 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10, so 40, plus in the remaining 88 numbers, 10 more (441-450), so total 50.\n\nFor 8's, 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10, so 40, plus in the remaining 88 numbers, 8 more (481-488), so total 48.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's: 89 times (from 400-488).\n\n8's: 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 4's in the hundreds place being 89 seems high. Let me check that again.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, yes, that's 89 times. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, in the remaining 88 numbers, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (441-450), so that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the tens place again. From 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So, when the tens digit is 4, it's from 440-449, but wait, 440 is included in the 401-488 range, right? So, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so yes, 10 times. But wait, 440 is 440, which is within 401-488, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but 440 is actually part of the 401-488 range, so yes, 10 numbers with tens digit 4.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, it's from 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so only 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but wait, 480 is included in the 401-488 range, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 8 numbers, but 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake there.\n\nWait, let me recount the tens place for 8's in the remaining 88 numbers.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 480-489, but since our book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place, not 8.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 8, but actually, it's 9. So, I think I made a mistake there.\n\nSo, let me correct that.\n\nIn the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place, not 8.\n\nSo, that changes the count for 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, let's recalculate:\n\nFor 8's in the tens place:\n\n- 4 blocks of 100: 40\n- Remaining 88 numbers: 9\nTotal: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 8, but it's actually 9.\n\nWait, but that can't be, because 480 is included in the 401-488 range, so 480 is part of the remaining 88 numbers. So, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, that means in the tens place, 8's occur 9 times in the remaining 88 numbers, not 8.\n\nSo, that changes the total count for 8's in the tens place to 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but that would mean that 8's in the tens place are 49, same as 4's in the units place, but let me check.\n\nWait, no, 4's in the tens place were 50, and 8's in the tens place are 49.\n\nWait, let me correct that.\n\nSo, let me go back step by step.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n- 4's: 49\n- 8's: 49\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- 4 blocks of 100: 40\n- Remaining 88 numbers: 10 (from 441-450)\nTotal: 50\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- 4 blocks of 100: 40\n- Remaining 88 numbers: 9 (from 480-488)\nTotal: 49\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nWait, so 4's: 188, 8's: 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, so the difference is 90, not 91 as I previously thought. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial count of 8's in the tens place, thinking it was 8 instead of 9.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488). So, 9 numbers, so 9 times the digit 8 appears in the tens place in the remaining 88 numbers.\n\nSo, that makes the total 8's in the tens place 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, so the correct answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make any other mistakes. Let me go through each step again.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- Each block of 10 has one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n- 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48 for each digit.\n- The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once.\n- So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 and 10 where it's 8.\n- 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 full blocks, each contributing 10, so 40 for each digit.\n- Remaining 88 numbers: 401-488.\n- For 4's in tens place: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10.\n- For 8's in tens place: 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9.\n- So, 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\n- 8's: none, since the book ends at 488, so 0.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nYes, that seems correct now. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place again.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nFor each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- For each digit from 0-9, each appears equally in the units place over the range.\n- Total numbers: 488\n- Number of complete decades (blocks of 10): floor(488 / 10) = 48\n- Remaining numbers: 488 - 48*10 = 8\n- Each complete decade contributes 1 to 4's and 1 to 8's in units place.\n- So, 48*1 = 48 for each.\n- Now, the remaining 8 numbers: 481-488, their units digits are 1-8.\n- So, 4 appears once (at 484), and 8 appears once (at 488).\n- So, total 4's in units: 48 + 1 = 49\n- Total 8's in units: 48 + 1 = 49\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each block of 100.\n- Number of complete centuries (blocks of 100): floor(488 / 100) = 4\n- Remaining numbers: 488 - 4*100 = 88\n- Each complete century contributes 10 to 4's and 10 to 8's in tens place.\n- So, 4*10 = 40 for each.\n- Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), we need to find how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n- The tens digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for 401-488:\n- 401-410: tens digit 0\n- 411-420: 1\n- 421-430: 2\n- 431-440: 3\n- 441-450: 4\n- 451-460: 5\n- 461-470: 6\n- 471-480: 7\n- 481-488: 8\n- So, in the tens place, 4 appears once in 441-450 (10 numbers), so 10 times.\n- 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, but wait, 480 is included in the previous block (471-480), so 480 is part of the 471-480 group, which has tens digit 7, right? Wait, 480 is 4-8-0, so the tens digit is 8. Wait, but 480 is in 480-489, but our range is up to 488. So, 480 is included in 401-488, and its tens digit is 8.\n\nWait, so in the remaining 88 numbers, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 times.\n\nTherefore, in the remaining 88 numbers:\n\n- 4's in tens place: 10\n- 8's in tens place: 9\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50\n\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- For 4's: numbers from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n- For 8's: no numbers in the book have 8 in the hundreds place, so 0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think I've double-checked all the steps, so I'm confident that the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total complete blocks of 10 in 488: 48.\n   - Each block contributes 1 occurrence of 4 and 8.\n   - Remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have 4 and 8 each once.\n   - **Total 4's:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Total 8's:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers.\n   - Total complete blocks of 100 in 488: 4.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences of 4 and 8.\n   - Remaining 88 numbers (401-488):\n     - 4's in tens place: 10 (441-450).\n     - 8's in tens place: 9 (480-488).\n   - **Total 4's:** 4\u00d710 + 10 = 50.\n   - **Total 8's:** 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4's appear 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8's do not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 4's:** 89.\n   - **Total 8's:** 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should understand how page numbers are structured. Each page number is a three-digit number, right? Wait, no, actually, the first page is 1, which is a single digit, then it goes up to 488, which is a three-digit number. So, the page numbers can be 1-digit, 2-digit, or 3-digit numbers. Hmm, maybe I should consider each digit place separately\u2014units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place one by one and count how many times the digits 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. \n\nBut wait, the book has 488 pages, so the total number of page numbers is 488. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488? Let me calculate that. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then 8 extra pages. \n\nIn each complete block of 10, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, for 48 blocks, that would be 48 times 1 for 4's and 48 times 1 for 8's. So, that's 48 each. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (page 484) and 8 appears once (page 488). \n\nSo, in the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 + 1 = 49, and the total number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49. So, they are equal in the units place. \n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in a block of 100. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each block of 100, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times as well.\n\nSince the book has 488 pages, how many complete blocks of 100 are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an incomplete block from 401 to 488.\n\nIn each of the 4 complete blocks, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so that's 4*10 = 40 times. Similarly, 8 appears 4*10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, in the incomplete block from 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nFrom 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 (in 401-410) to 8 (in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Well, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, but wait, in the incomplete block, the hundreds digit is 4, so the tens digit 4 would be from 440-449. But wait, our last page is 488, so 440-449 is within 401-488. So, that's 10 times. \n\nSimilarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488. So, that's 9 times. Wait, no, actually, in the tens place, 8 appears when the tens digit is 8, which is in the range 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, that's 9 numbers: 480-488. So, the tens digit is 8 for all these, which is 9 times. \n\nWait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for each of these, so 9 times. But in the complete blocks before, each block contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place. So, in the incomplete block, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). \n\nSo, in the tens place, the total number of 4's is 4*10 (from complete blocks) + 10 (from incomplete) = 50. And the total number of 8's is 4*10 + 9 = 49. \n\nWait, let me check that again. Each complete block of 100 has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 blocks give 40 each. Then, in the incomplete block from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (440-449) and 8 occurs 9 times (480-488). So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case, since the book has 488 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, and 4 for 300-399, and then 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, 300-399 would have hundreds digit 3, and 400-488 would have hundreds digit 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times, and 8's appear 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each digit place.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8, so 48 each. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) contribute 1 4 (484) and 1 8 (488). So, units place: 48+1=49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each full hundred block contributes 10 4's and 10 8's. So, 4 blocks give 40 each. Then, in the incomplete block from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449 (10 times) and 8 from 480-488 (9 times). So, 4's in tens: 40+10=50, 8's: 40+9=49. That looks right.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times. 8 doesn't appear in hundreds place. So, 4's: 89, 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any pages. For example, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 pages, right? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place, in the incomplete block, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 is from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place: The last 8 pages are 481-488, so units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place adds 1 each, making totals 49 each.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 pages contributes 1 '4' and 1 '8'.\n   - 48 complete blocks (1-480) give 48 each.\n   - Pages 481-488 add 1 '4' (484) and 1 '8' (488).\n   - Total: 49 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 pages contributes 10 '4's and 10 '8's.\n   - 4 complete blocks (1-400) give 40 each.\n   - Pages 401-488: '4' appears 10 times (440-449), '8' appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - '4' appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 '4's and 0 '8's.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488. Then, I'll do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by understanding how digits are distributed in page numbers. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 up to 488. \n\nI remember that to count the number of times a specific digit appears, I can break it down by each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. So, I'll handle each place separately for both 4 and 8.\n\nLet's start with the digit 4. I'll consider each place one by one.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   The digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. \n\n   Now, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). \n\n   So, in each complete block, there's one 4 in the units place. That's 48 times. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. Since 4 is within this range, there's one more 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. \n\n   How many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488? That's 4 (since 400 is the fourth block). Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 4 blocks * 10 = 40.\n\n   Now, the last block is from 401 to 488, which is 88 numbers. The tens digit in this block goes from 0 to 8. The digit 4 appears in the tens place in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 more 4's in the tens place. So total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   The hundreds digit cycles every 1000 numbers, but since our book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for pages 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), or 4 (400-488). \n\n   The digit 4 in the hundreds place appears from page 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check. For the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. For the tens place, I considered each 100 block contributing 10, plus the 440-449 in the last block, which is 10 more, totaling 50. That seems right. Units place: 48 full decades plus one more in the last partial decade, totaling 49. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, maybe that's correct.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   Similar to 4, in each block of 10, 8 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks and 8 extra numbers (481-488). \n\n   Each full block contributes 1 8 in the units place, so 48 times. In the last partial block, units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 is included. So, that's one more 8. So total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   In each block of 100, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place, such as 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, the last block's tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). \n\n   Let's break it down. From 1-488, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488). Wait, actually, each hundred block contributes a 10 in the tens place. So, 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place. That's 4 * 10 = 40.\n\n   Now, in the last block, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   The hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So, hundreds place 8's are 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, so 4's are 188 and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's because I might have made a mistake there. In the last block, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, 4 blocks * 10 = 40, plus 9, totaling 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's, in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4. So that's 89. Then, tens place: 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10, so 40, plus 440-449, which is 10, totaling 50. Units place: 48 full decades, each contributing 1, so 48, plus one more in 481-488, totaling 49. So, 89 + 50 + 49 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nSo, 188 4's and 98 8's. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 = 88, so adding 1 gives 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nFor the 8's, in the tens place, I had 49, which is 40 from the full hundreds and 9 from the last partial hundred. That seems correct. So, yes, 98 8's in total.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full decades (48 occurrences) + 1 in the last partial decade = 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 full hundreds (40) + 10 in the last partial hundred (440-449) = 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 (400-488).\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full decades + 1 in the last partial decade = 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 full hundreds (40) + 9 in the last partial hundred (480-488) = 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 0.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I know that each page number is printed once, starting from 1 and ending at 488. So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by thinking about how digits are counted in numbers. Each digit in a number can be in the units place, tens place, hundreds place, etc. Since 488 is a three-digit number, I'll need to consider the units, tens, and hundreds places separately for both 4's and 8's.\n\nI'll handle the counts for 4's and 8's separately and then compare them.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484.\n   - To find how many times this happens, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full groups of 10, and then check if there's a remainder. 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups and 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n   - Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48 times.\n   - But wait, in the extra numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear again in the units place here. So, total units place 4's: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449.\n   - How many such groups are there in 488 pages? Let's see, 488 \u00f7 100 = 4.88, so there are 4 complete groups (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then the next group starts at 401-500, but since we only go up to 488, we have an incomplete group.\n   - Each complete group contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 groups \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Now, in the incomplete group (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for numbers 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 more 4's in the tens place.\n   - Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's valid. So total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.\n   - Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\nNow, I'll do the same process for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, similar to 4's, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times.\n   - In the extra numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once here (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489.\n   - But since our book ends at 488, the last group is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so it's 9 numbers. So, how many complete groups of 100 do we have?\n   - 488 \u00f7 100 = 4.88, so 4 complete groups (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Now, in the incomplete group (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for numbers 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so 9 8's in the tens place.\n   - Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again.\n\nWait, for the units place, I had 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then in the extra numbers 481-488, the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included. So, that's one more 8, making units place 8's = 49. That seems correct.\n\nFor the tens place, in each complete group of 100, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so 4 groups \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, in the last group (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for numbers 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more 8's. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier when I calculated 4's, I had 187, and 8's as 98. So the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's.\n\nWait, when I counted the 4's in the tens place, I considered 401-488, and said that 440-449 is within that range, so that's 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is correct, as 440 is within 401-488, and 449 is also within. So, that's 10 numbers, contributing 10 4's in the tens place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nUnits place: 48 times, as every 10 numbers, so 48.\n\nSo 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nAnd for 8's, units place: 49, tens place: 49, so total 98.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly?\n\nWait, in the tens place for 4's, I had 4 complete groups (each 100 numbers) contributing 10 each, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, in the incomplete group, 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more, making 50. That's correct.\n\nFor 8's, in the tens place, 4 complete groups contributing 10 each, so 40, and in the incomplete group, 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more, making 49. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 488 \u00f710=48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1-8, so 4 doesn't appear again. So 48.\n\nUnits place for 8's: same as 4's, 48 full groups, 48, plus one more in 488, so 49.\n\nSo, 4's total: 187, 8's total: 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I feel like I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again.\n\nNumbers from 400 to 488: that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, 89 in hundreds place for 4's.\n\nWait, but when I added up, I had 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\nAnd for 8's, 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. In the incomplete group, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. That's 9 numbers, right? Because 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So that's 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 480 is included, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place, so 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are accurate.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just think again about the units place for 8's. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nIt's every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488.\n\nSo, how many such numbers are there?\n\nThe last one is 488, which is 8 in the units place.\n\nSo, the number of 8's in the units place is the number of times 8 appears as the last digit, which is floor(488/10) + 1 if 488 mod 10 >=8.\n\nWait, 488 \u00f710 is 48.8, so floor(48.8)=48. Then, since 488 mod10=8, which is equal to 8, so we add 1, making it 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the units place, 488 \u00f710=48.8, floor is 48, and 488 mod10=8, which is greater than 4, so does that mean we have an extra 4? Wait, no, because 488 is the last number, and the units digit is 8, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484, which is within 488. So, 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48.\n\nWait, but 488 \u00f710=48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 doesn't appear again. So, 48 is correct.\n\nWait, but when I did the 8's, I had 48 full groups, and then an extra one because 488 is included, making it 49. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, yes, 49 8's in the units place, 48 4's in the units place.\n\nSo, I think my counts are correct.\n\nThus, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I just thought, when counting the hundreds place for 4's, I considered 400-488 as 89 numbers, each contributing a 4. But wait, 400 is the first page, so from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the difference is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of 4's printed is \\boxed{89} more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we need to count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once.

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I should understand what exactly is being asked. The book has pages numbered from 1 to 488, and each page number is printed once. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by thinking about how digits are distributed in page numbers. Page numbers can be 1-digit, 2-digit, or 3-digit numbers. In this case, since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488, which is a 3-digit number. So, I need to consider all page numbers from 1 to 488 and count the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nI'll approach this by analyzing each digit place separately\u2014units, tens, and hundreds. For each place, I'll calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles through 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears once (e.g., 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the digit 8 appears once (e.g., 8, 18, 28, etc.). \n\nTo find out how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488 pages, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives me 48 complete sets with a remainder of 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 times, and 8 also appears 48 times. But wait, the remainder is 8, so in the incomplete set from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial set, does the digit 4 appear? Yes, at page 484. So, that's one more 4 in the units place. Similarly, the digit 8 appears at page 488, so that's one more 8 in the units place. \n\nTherefore, in the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 (from the complete sets) + 1 (from the partial set) = 49. Similarly, the total number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, 4 and 8 appear the same number of times.\n\nNext, I'll move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89).\n\nSince the book has 488 pages, there are four complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each of these contributes 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, that's 4 * 10 = 40 for each digit. \n\nNow, the remaining pages are from 401 to 488. In this range, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-409) to 8 (480-488). Let's break this down. \n\nFrom 401-409: The tens digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's here in the tens place.\nFrom 410-419: The tens digit is 1, so no.\nFrom 420-429: The tens digit is 2, so no.\nFrom 430-439: The tens digit is 3, so no.\nFrom 440-449: The tens digit is 4. So, here, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (440-449). That's 10 more 4's.\nFrom 450-459: The tens digit is 5, so no.\nFrom 460-469: The tens digit is 6, so no.\nFrom 470-479: The tens digit is 7, so no.\nFrom 480-488: The tens digit is 8. Here, the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages (480-488). So, that's 9 more 8's.\n\nSo, in the tens place, from 401-488, we have 10 more 4's and 9 more 8's. Adding this to the earlier 40 each, the total for the tens place is:\n\n4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 49 times.\n\nNow, onto the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is the first digit of the page number. For pages 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's there. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, so no. From 200-299, it's 2, so no. From 300-399, it's 3, so no. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. \n\nSo, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. \n\nWhat about 8's in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, there are 0 occurrences of 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times, and 8's appear 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's:\n\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\n- From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers contribute one 4 and one 8 in the units place. There are 48 complete sets of 10, so 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both, which seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) give 4*10=40 each. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449 (10 times) and 8 in 480-488 (9 times). So, 4's: 40 +10=50, 8's:40 +9=49. That looks correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- From 400-488, hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 pages. So, 89 4's. No 8's in hundreds place. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nHmm, so according to this, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. That seems correct based on the calculations.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. When I was counting the tens place from 401-488, I considered 440-449 as 10 pages, which is correct. But 480-488 is 9 pages because 488 is the last page. So, 480-488 is 9 pages, right? Because 488 -480 +1=9. So, 9 8's in the tens place from there, which is correct.\n\nAnother way to check is to think about the total number of digits printed. Wait, that might complicate things, but just to ensure I didn't overcount somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of each digit place separately again.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- For each digit from 1-9, each digit appears exactly 48 times in the units place for the first 480 pages (since 480/10=48). Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so each digit appears once. So, 4 and 8 each get one more, making it 49 each. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times in the tens place for the first 480 pages (since 480/100=4.8, but actually, for each hundred, each tens digit appears 10 times. So, for 480 pages, which is 4 full hundreds and 80 pages. Each hundred contributes 10 times each digit in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 for each digit. Then, from 401-480, which is 80 pages, the tens digits go from 0-7 (since 401-480 is 80 pages, which is 8 sets of 10). Wait, no, 401-480 is actually 80 pages, which is 8 sets of 10. So, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), up to 7 (471-480). So, in this range, the tens digits 0-7 each appear once, contributing 10 pages each. So, in the tens place from 401-480, digits 0-7 each appear 10 times. So, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 does not appear in the tens place here because 480-488 is beyond 480. Wait, but earlier I considered 480-488 as part of the tens place for 8's. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in how I broke down the tens place. Let me clarify.\n\nFrom 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, for 4 full hundreds (1-400), each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place (4*10). Then, from 401-488, which is 88 pages, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). Let's break down the tens digits in 401-488:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 pages)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10 pages)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10 pages)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10 pages)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 pages)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10 pages)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10 pages)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10 pages)\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 pages)\n\nWait, so from 401-488, the tens digits go up to 8, but only for 8 pages (481-488). So, in the tens place, from 401-488:\n\n- Tens digit 4 appears in 441-450: 10 pages\n- Tens digit 8 appears in 481-488: 8 pages\n\nSo, in the tens place, from 401-488, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nTherefore, total in the tens place:\n\n- 4's: 40 (from 1-400) +10 (from 401-450) =50\n- 8's:40 (from 1-400) +8 (from 481-488)=48\n\nWait, earlier I thought from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449 (10 pages) and 8 in 480-488 (9 pages). But now, I'm seeing that in 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 441-450, which is 10 pages, and 8 is in 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, that's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, perhaps I was miscounting earlier. Let me clarify:\n\n- 440-449 is part of the 401-488 range, right? 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 pages where the tens digit is 4.\n\nSimilarly, 480-488 is the range where the tens digit is 8, which is 9 pages (480-488 inclusive). But wait, 480-488 is 9 pages, but in the tens place, 480-488 is part of the 401-488 range, so the tens digit is 8 for these 9 pages.\n\nWait, but earlier I considered 481-488 as 8 pages, but 480-488 is 9 pages because 488 -480 +1=9.\n\nSo, in the tens place from 401-488:\n\n- Tens digit 4: 440-449 (10 pages)\n- Tens digit 8: 480-488 (9 pages)\n\nTherefore, in the tens place:\n\n- 4's:40 (from 1-400) +10=50\n- 8's:40 (from 1-400) +9=49\n\nSo, that brings us back to the original calculation: 50 4's and 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, that seems correct. Therefore, the initial calculation was accurate.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think of another way to count. Maybe by considering each digit place separately and ensuring I didn't miss anything.\n\nAnother approach is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each place.\n\nFor the units place:\n\n- For each digit d from 0-9, the number of times it appears in the units place from 1 to N is floor((N + 10 - d)/10). But perhaps a simpler way is to note that in every block of 10 numbers, each digit appears once in the units place.\n\nSo, from 1-488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 48 complete blocks (1-480), each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place:49 each.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\n- Each digit appears 10 times in each block of 100 numbers. So, from 1-400, each digit appears 40 times in the tens place. Then, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0-8, but not completing another full hundred.\n\nIn 401-488:\n\n- Tens digits 0-7 each appear 10 times (401-410, 411-420,...,471-480)\n- Tens digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488)\n\nSo, in the tens place:\n\n- 4 appears in the tens place in 440-449, which is 10 times\n- 8 appears in the tens place in 480-488, which is 9 times\n\nSo, adding to the 40 from 1-400:\n\n- 4's:40+10=50\n- 8's:40+9=49\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\n- From 1-399, hundreds digit is 0,1,2,3, so no 4's or 8's\n- From 400-488, hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 numbers (400-488 inclusive)\n\nSo, 89 4's in the hundreds place, 0 8's.\n\nAdding them all up:\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nI think I've checked it thoroughly. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should understand how page numbers work. Each page from 1 to 488 is printed once, so I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to get the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering how digits are structured in numbers. Page numbers can be one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit numbers. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, pages 1 to 9 are single-digit, 10 to 99 are two-digit, 100 to 488 are three-digit.\n\nI think I can break down the counting based on the number of digits in the page numbers. Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears once. Therefore, the number of 4's and 8's in the units place should be the same, right? \n\nBut wait, I need to check if this holds true all the way up to 488. Let me think. The total number of pages is 488, which is 48 full groups of 10 (since 48*10=480) plus 8 more pages (481 to 488). So, in the units place, from 1 to 480, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 48 times. So, the digit 4 appears 48 times in the units place, and the same for 8. But then, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1 through 8. So, in this last partial group, the digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). Therefore, in the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, the units place contributes equally to both digits, 49 each. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for every 100 numbers. So, for example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, each digit in the tens place appears 10 times per 100 numbers.\n\nSince the book has 488 pages, that's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each full hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for each hundred, both digits appear 10 times in the tens place.\n\nThere are 4 full hundreds, so the digit 4 appears 4*10 = 40 times in the tens place, and the same for 8. Now, what about the last partial hundred, which is 401-488? The tens digits here go from 0 to 8. Let's see, from 401-409, the tens digit is 0; 410-419 is 1; 420-429 is 2; 430-439 is 3; 440-449 is 4; 450-459 is 5; 460-469 is 6; 470-479 is 7; and 480-488 is 8.\n\nSo, in the tens place for 401-488, the digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488, right? So, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place here.\n\nSimilarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place in 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place. Because from 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8, but the units digits go from 0 to 8, so that's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, for the last partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place overall, 4 appears 4*10 + 10 = 50 times, and 8 appears 4*10 + 9 = 49 times. So, in the tens place, 4's are more than 8's by 1.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is either 1, 2, 3, or 4, never 8. So, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. That's a difference of 89.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each place.\n\nStarting with the units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49. Difference = 0.\n\nTens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 49. Difference = +1.\n\nHundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0. Difference = +89.\n\nTotal difference = 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step because it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nFirst, units place: from 1 to 488, each digit 0-9 appears equally in the units place except possibly the last partial group. Wait, I thought each group of 10 contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 full groups of 10 (1-480) give 48 each, and then 481-488 gives one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So, total 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each full hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place, so 4 full hundreds give 40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449 (10 times) and 8 in 480-488 (9 times). So, 4's tens count becomes 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's becomes 40 + 9 = 49. So, that's correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place, so 0. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up the differences: units place 0, tens place +1, hundreds place +89. So, total difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I added up the differences, I did 0 +1 +89 =90. But let me confirm by calculating the total number of 4's and 8's separately.\n\nTotal 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 +50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) =49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, the difference is 90. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAnd in the tens place, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. And 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, that's correct.\n\nUnits place: 49 each, so no difference.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal number of 8's is 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98.\n\nSo, 188 -98 =90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears equally in the units place every 10 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 480, each digit appears 48 times.\n   - From 481 to 488, 4 and 8 each appear once.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Difference: 0\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - Each digit appears 10 times per 100 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 400, each digit appears 40 times.\n   - From 401 to 488:\n     - 4 appears 10 times (440-449).\n     - 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n   - Difference: +1\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 never appears.\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n   - Difference: +89\n\n**Total Difference**:\n- Units: 0\n- Tens: +1\n- Hundreds: +89\n- **Total**: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90\n\nThus, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should consider each digit place separately: the units place and the tens place. Because a page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number, right? So, maybe I should handle each digit position one by one.\n\nLet me start by understanding how many times each digit appears in the units place. For the units place, every digit from 0 to 9 should appear equally often in each set of ten pages. For example, pages 1-10 have each digit 0-9 once in the units place. But wait, page 10 is actually 10, so the units digit is 0. Hmm, maybe I should adjust for that.\n\nWait, the first page is 1, so pages 1-9 are single-digit, and from 10 onwards, they're two-digit numbers. So, in the units place, from 1 to 9, each digit 1-9 appears once. Then, from 10 to 488, each set of ten pages (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.) will have each digit 0-9 appearing once in the units place. So, the number of times each digit appears in the units place can be calculated based on how many complete sets of ten there are and whether there's a partial set at the end.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears ten times in each block of 100 pages. For example, in pages 1-100, the tens digit cycles from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, each digit in the tens place appears 10 times per hundred pages.\n\nWait, but the book has 488 pages, so I need to consider up to page 488. So, maybe I should break down the problem into units and tens places separately.\n\nLet me start with the units place.\n\nUnits place:\n- Pages 1-9: Each digit 1-9 appears once. So, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 appears once.\n- Pages 10-488: Each block of ten pages (e.g., 10-19, 20-29, etc.) has each digit 0-9 appearing once in the units place. So, how many complete blocks of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, from 10 to 488, that's 488 - 9 = 479 pages. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Actually, the number of complete blocks of ten is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. So, there are 48 complete blocks of ten, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Then, there's a partial block from 481 to 488, which is 8 pages. So, the units digits in this partial block are 1-8. So, in this partial block, 4 appears once and 8 appears once.\n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 48 blocks * 1 + 1 (from the partial block) = 49.\nTotal 8's in units place: 48 blocks * 1 + 1 (from the partial block) = 49.\n\nWait, but wait, from 1-9, 4 appears once, 8 appears once. Then from 10-488, which is 48 complete blocks of ten, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, the last partial block from 481-488 has 8 pages, so units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So, total 4's in units place: 1 (from 1-9) + 48 + 1 = 50. Similarly, 8's in units place: 1 (from 1-9) + 48 + 1 = 50.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because 488 is the last page, so the last page is 488, which is part of the 480-489 block. But since we're only going up to 488, the units digits in the last block (480-488) are 0-8. So, from 480-488, the units digits are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once and 8 appears once in the units place. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nTens place:\n- Pages 1-9: The tens digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's here.\n- Pages 10-99: Each ten's block (e.g., 10-19, 20-29, etc.) has the same digit in the tens place for ten pages. So, for example, in 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for ten pages, so 4 appears ten times in the tens place. Similarly, in 80-89, the tens digit is 8 for ten pages, so 8 appears ten times in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there up to page 488?\n\nWait, pages go up to 488, so let's see. From 10 to 99, that's 90 pages. Then from 100 to 488, that's 389 pages. So, in the tens place, for each hundred, the digits cycle from 0 to 9 in the tens place, each appearing ten times per hundred.\n\nSo, from 1-99, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49 (ten times) and 8 in 80-89 (ten times).\n\nFrom 100-199: The tens digit cycles again, so 4 appears ten times in 140-149, and 8 appears ten times in 180-189.\n\nSimilarly, from 200-299: 4 appears ten times in 240-249, and 8 appears ten times in 280-289.\n\nFrom 300-399: 4 appears ten times in 340-349, and 8 appears ten times in 380-389.\n\nFrom 400-488: Now, this is a bit tricky because we don't go up to 499. So, in 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, for the tens digit 4, it appears in 440-449, which is ten times. For the tens digit 8, it appears in 480-488, but since we stop at 488, that's nine pages (480-488), so the tens digit 8 appears nine times in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me check that. From 480-488, that's nine pages: 480,481,...,488. Each has 8 in the tens place. So, 8 appears nine times in the tens place from 480-488.\n\nWait, but in the other blocks, like 400-409, the tens digit is 0, so no 4 or 8 there. Then 410-419: tens digit 1, no. 420-429: tens digit 2, no. 430-439: tens digit 3, no. 440-449: tens digit 4, so ten times. 450-459: tens digit 5, no. 460-469: tens digit 6, no. 470-479: tens digit 7, no. 480-488: tens digit 8, nine times. So, in 400-488, 4 appears ten times (440-449), and 8 appears nine times (480-488).\n\nSo, let's tally up the tens digits:\n\n- 1-99: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n- 100-199: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n- 200-299: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n- 300-399: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n- 400-488: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50 times.\nTotal 8's in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check each hundred:\n\n1-99: 4 appears in 40-49: 10 times; 8 appears in 80-89: 10 times.\n100-199: 4 appears in 140-149: 10 times; 8 appears in 180-189: 10 times.\n200-299: 4 appears in 240-249: 10 times; 8 appears in 280-289: 10 times.\n300-399: 4 appears in 340-349: 10 times; 8 appears in 380-389: 10 times.\n400-488: 4 appears in 440-449: 10 times; 8 appears in 480-488: 9 times.\n\nSo yes, 50 times for 4's and 49 times for 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's add up the units and tens places.\n\nUnits place:\n- 4's: 50 times\n- 8's: 50 times\n\nTens place:\n- 4's: 50 times\n- 8's: 49 times\n\nSo, total 4's: 50 (units) + 50 (tens) = 100 times.\nTotal 8's: 50 (units) + 49 (tens) = 99 times.\n\nWait, so 4's appear 100 times, and 8's appear 99 times. So, the difference is 1 more 4 than 8.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check because I might have made a mistake in the units place.\n\nWait, earlier I thought that from 1-9, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. Then, from 10-488, which is 488 - 9 = 479 pages, but that's not the right way to calculate the number of blocks. Wait, 488 pages, so from 10 to 488, that's 488 - 9 = 479 pages, which is 47 full tens (47 * 10 = 470 pages) and 9 pages remaining. So, 47 full blocks of ten, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Then, the last 9 pages (480-488) have units digits 0-8, so 4 appears once and 8 appears once.\n\nSo, units place:\n\nFrom 1-9: 4 once, 8 once.\nFrom 10-479: 47 blocks of ten, each contributing 4 and 8 once in units place: 47 each.\nFrom 480-488: 480 has 0, 481 has 1, ..., 488 has 8. So, 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488).\n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 1 + 47 + 1 = 49.\nTotal 8's in units place: 1 + 47 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, earlier I thought 50 each, but now I'm getting 49 each. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, let's recalculate. From 1-9: 4 and 8 each once.\n\nFrom 10 onwards: up to 488, so the number of complete blocks of ten is floor(488 / 10) = 48. So, 48 blocks, each contributing 4 and 8 once in the units place, so 48 each.\n\nBut wait, 48 blocks would end at page 480 (since 48 * 10 = 480). Then, from 481 to 488, that's 8 pages, so units digits 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 1 (from 1-9) + 48 (from 10-480) + 1 (from 481-488) = 50.\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: 1 + 48 + 1 = 50.\n\nSo, earlier conclusion was correct: 50 each in units place.\n\nBut in the tens place, we had 50 for 4's and 49 for 8's, so total 4's: 50 + 50 = 100, 8's: 50 + 49 = 99. So, the difference is 1.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again.\n\nIn the tens place, from 1-99:\n\n4 appears in 40-49: 10 times.\n8 appears in 80-89: 10 times.\n\nFrom 100-199:\n\n4 appears in 140-149: 10 times.\n8 appears in 180-189: 10 times.\n\nFrom 200-299:\n\n4 appears in 240-249: 10 times.\n8 appears in 280-289: 10 times.\n\nFrom 300-399:\n\n4 appears in 340-349: 10 times.\n8 appears in 380-389: 10 times.\n\nFrom 400-488:\n\n4 appears in 440-449: 10 times.\n8 appears in 480-488: 9 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50.\n8's in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, total 4's: 50 (units) + 50 (tens) = 100.\nTotal 8's: 50 (units) + 49 (tens) = 99.\n\nSo, 100 - 99 = 1. Therefore, there is 1 more 4 than 8.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there any other place where digits could appear? Like, the hundreds place. Wait, in a 488-page book, the page numbers go up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nSo, let's check the hundreds place.\n\nHundreds place:\n- Pages 1-99: No hundreds digit, so 0.\n- Pages 100-199: Hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's.\n- Pages 200-299: Hundreds digit is 2, no 4's or 8's.\n- Pages 300-399: Hundreds digit is 3, no 4's or 8's.\n- Pages 400-488: Hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the highest page is 488, so the hundreds digit is 4.\n\nSo, adding this to our counts:\n\n4's in hundreds place: 89.\n8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 100 (units and tens) + 89 = 189.\nTotal 8's: 99 (units and tens) + 0 = 99.\n\nWait, that's a big difference. So, I think I missed the hundreds place earlier. So, the correct total is 189 4's and 99 8's, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier I thought it was 1, but now it's 90. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in not considering the hundreds place.\n\nWait, let me recast the entire problem.\n\nEach page number from 1 to 488 is printed once. We need to count how many times the digit 4 appears and how many times 8 appears in all the page numbers, then find the difference.\n\nSo, let's approach it systematically, considering each digit place: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place:\n- For each digit from 0-9, each digit appears equally in the units place across all page numbers.\n- The total number of page numbers is 488.\n- The number of complete groups of 10 is 48 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8), so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n- The remaining 8 pages (488 - 48*10 = 488 - 480 = 8) are from 481 to 488, which have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once and 8 appears once.\n- So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n- Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 50 each, but now it's 49 each. Which is correct? Wait, let's see: from 1-9, units digits are 1-9, so 4 and 8 each appear once. Then, from 10-488, which is 479 pages, which is 47 complete groups of 10 (47*10=470) and 9 remaining pages (471-488). Wait, no, 488 - 9 = 479, which is 47*10 + 9. So, 47 complete groups of ten, each contributing 4 and 8 once, so 47 each. Then, the remaining 9 pages (471-488) have units digits 1-9, so 4 appears once and 8 appears once.\n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 1 (from 1-9) + 47 (from 10-470) + 1 (from 471-488) = 49.\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: 1 + 47 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by considering 48 complete groups. It should be 47 complete groups of ten from 10-470, and then 471-488 as the remaining 9 pages.\n\nSo, units place: 49 each for 4 and 8.\n\nTens place:\n- For each digit from 0-9, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for every hundred pages.\n- From 1-99: 4 appears in 40-49: 10 times; 8 appears in 80-89: 10 times.\n- From 100-199: 4 appears in 140-149: 10 times; 8 appears in 180-189: 10 times.\n- From 200-299: 4 appears in 240-249: 10 times; 8 appears in 280-289: 10 times.\n- From 300-399: 4 appears in 340-349: 10 times; 8 appears in 380-389: 10 times.\n- From 400-488: 4 appears in 440-449: 10 times; 8 appears in 480-488: 9 times (since 488 is the last page).\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50.\nTotal 8's in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n- From 1-99: No hundreds digit, so 0.\n- From 100-199: Hundreds digit is 1: 0 times for 4 and 8.\n- From 200-299: Hundreds digit is 2: 0 times for 4 and 8.\n- From 300-399: Hundreds digit is 3: 0 times for 4 and 8.\n- From 400-488: Hundreds digit is 4: 89 times (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\nTotal 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nNow, adding up all the places:\n\n4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that's a big difference. So, earlier I thought it was 1, but after considering the hundreds place, it's 90. So, I must have missed the hundreds place earlier, which significantly affects the count.\n\nWait, let me verify the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, each starting with 4 in the hundreds place. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the highest page is 488, so the hundreds digit is only 4.\n\nSo, adding that to the previous counts, the total 4's are 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the units and tens place again to make sure I didn't make a mistake there.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFrom 1-9: 4 and 8 each once.\nFrom 10-488: 488 - 9 = 479 pages. 479 / 10 = 47.9, so 47 complete groups of ten, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place: 47 each.\nThen, the remaining 9 pages (480-488) have units digits 0-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 1 + 47 + 1 = 49.\nTotal 8's in units place: 1 + 47 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nFrom 1-99: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\nFrom 100-199: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\nFrom 200-299: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\nFrom 300-399: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\nFrom 400-488: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, 4's in tens place: 10*4 + 10 = 50.\n8's in tens place: 10*4 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's: 89 times.\n8's: 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should understand how page numbers are structured. Each page number is a three-digit number, right? From 1 to 488. Wait, actually, no, page 1 is just '1', page 10 is '10', and so on up to page 488, which is a three-digit number. So, the page numbers can be one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit numbers. Hmm, maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place one by one. Maybe I can calculate the number of times the digit 4 appears in each place and then do the same for the digit 8, and then find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in the units place. But wait, in our case, the first page is 1, so the first block is 1-10, where the units digits are 1-0. So, in each block of 10, the digits 0-9 appear once each in the units place. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then an extra 8 pages. So, in each complete block, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 appears once. So, for 48 blocks, the number of 4's in the units place is 48, and the same for 8's.\n\nNow, the remaining 8 pages after the 48 blocks are pages 481 to 488. Let me check the units digits here: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in these, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). So, adding these, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's, 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, both digits appear 49 times each. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, from 1-100, the tens digits go from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place per hundred.\n\nSo, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and the same for 8 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times for 4's and 40 times for 8's.\n\nNow, the remaining 88 pages are from 401 to 488. Let's look at the tens digit here. The tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). Wait, but 401-410 is 10 pages, 411-420 is another 10, and so on up to 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, the tens digits in 401-488 go from 0 to 8, but the last group is only 9 pages instead of 10.\n\nSo, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does each digit appear? For digits 0 to 7, each appears 10 times (e.g., 401-410 has tens digit 0, 411-420 has tens digit 1, etc., each block being 10 pages). But for tens digit 8, it's only 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, the digit 8 in the tens place appears 9 times here.\n\nWait, but let me check: 401-488 is 88 pages. Let me count the number of tens digits:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 pages)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10 pages)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10 pages)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10 pages)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 pages)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10 pages)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10 pages)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10 pages)\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 pages)\n\nWait, that's 9 groups, but the last group is 481-488, which is 8 pages, so the tens digit 8 appears 8 times here, not 9. Wait, but earlier I thought 480-488 is 9 pages, but 480 is included in 480-488, which would be pages 480,481,...,488, which is 9 pages. But wait, the way I broke it down, 471-480 is the 7 tens digit, which is 10 pages, so 480 is the last page of that group. Then 481-488 is 8 pages, so the tens digit is 8, appearing 8 times.\n\nWait, so in 401-488, the digit 4 appears in the tens place in 441-450, which is 10 times. The digit 8 appears in the tens place in 481-488, which is 8 times. So, in the tens place, from 401-488, the digit 4 appears 10 times, and the digit 8 appears 8 times.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place overall:\n\n- Digit 4: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40 times, plus 10 times in 401-488, so total 50 times.\n- Digit 8: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40 times, plus 8 times in 401-488, so total 48 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 48 times. The difference here is 50 - 48 = 2.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, in each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9, each appearing 10 times. So, in 4 hundreds, 4*10=40 times each for 4 and 8. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times. So, yes, 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50, 8's:40+8=48. So, the difference is +2 for 4's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, pages 1-99 have no hundreds digit, pages 100-199 have hundreds digit 1, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4.\n\nSo, let's calculate how many times each digit appears in the hundreds place.\n\n- Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (but since we're only printing page numbers, I think 0 isn't printed here. So, 0 doesn't count.)\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, appearing 100 times.\n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, appearing 100 times.\n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, appearing 100 times.\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\nSo, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is either 1,2,3, or 4. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times, and 8's appear 0 times. So, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFor digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nFor digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 48 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97 times.\n\nWait, let me check my addition:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99, plus 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) = 97, plus 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's printed is 188, and the total number of 8's is 97. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 188 - 97 = 91 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n- 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing 1 four and 1 eight. So, 48 each, plus the remaining 8 pages (481-488) where 484 has a 4 and 488 has an 8. So, units place: 48 +1=49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 times, so 4's total: 40 +10=50. The tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times, so 8's total:40 +8=48. So, tens place difference is +2.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 400-488: 89 pages, so hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. 8's: 0 times. So, hundreds place difference is +89.\n\nTotal:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =97.\n\nDifference: 188 -97=91.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check again, maybe I made a mistake in the tens place for 401-488.\n\nWait, in 401-488, the tens digits:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 pages)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10 pages)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10 pages)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10 pages)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 pages)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10 pages)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10 pages)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10 pages)\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 pages)\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear in 441-450, which is 10 times, and 8's appear in 481-488, which is 8 times. So, yes, 10 for 4's and 8 for 8's in the tens place beyond the 4 hundreds. So, 4's total in tens:40+10=50, 8's:40+8=48. So, correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times, 8's 0. So, correct.\n\nUnits place:49 each, so no difference.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, 8's:97, difference 91.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - 488 pages = 48 full decades (480 pages) + 8 extra pages.\n   - 4's: 48 + 1 (from 484) = 49.\n   - 8's: 48 + 1 (from 488) = 49.\n   - Difference: 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - 488 pages = 4 full hundreds (400 pages) + 88 extra pages.\n   - 4's: 4*10 = 40 + 10 (from 441-450) = 50.\n   - 8's: 4*10 = 40 + 8 (from 481-488) = 48.\n   - Difference: +2.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - Pages 1-99: No hundreds digit.\n   - Pages 100-199: 1 appears 100 times.\n   - Pages 200-299: 2 appears 100 times.\n   - Pages 300-399: 3 appears 100 times.\n   - Pages 400-488: 4 appears 89 times.\n   - 4's: 89.\n   - 8's: 0.\n   - Difference: +89.\n\n**Total Counts**:\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n**Difference**: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by **91**.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I should understand what exactly the problem is asking. It says that each page number is printed once, starting from 1 and ending at 488. I need to count how many times the digit '4' appears in all these page numbers and then subtract the number of times '8' appears. The result will tell me how many more 4's there are than 8's.\n\nAlright, let's start by thinking about how digits are counted in page numbers. Page numbers can be 1-digit, 2-digit, or 3-digit numbers. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers can be 1-digit (1-9), 2-digit (10-99), and 3-digit (100-488). \n\nI think the best approach is to calculate the number of times '4' appears in each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately and then do the same for '8'. Once I have the totals for each digit, I can subtract the total number of '8's from the total number of '4's to get the answer.\n\nLet me start with the digit '4'.\n\n**Counting the number of '4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The units digit cycles every 10 numbers: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n   - In each cycle of 10, '4' appears once in the units place.\n   - From page 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers.\n   - The number of complete cycles of 10 in 488 is 48 (since 48*10=480) with 8 remaining numbers (481-488).\n   - So, in each complete cycle, there's one '4' in the units place, so 48 cycles give 48 '4's.\n   - Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, '4' appears once more.\n   - Total '4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each cycle has 10 numbers where the tens digit is '4' (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n   - From 1 to 488, how many complete hundreds are there? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n   - In each complete hundred, the tens digit '4' appears 10 times (40-49). So, 4 hundreds give 4*10=40 '4's.\n   - Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), let's look at the tens place:\n     - Pages 401-409: tens digit is '0' (401-409), so no '4's here.\n     - Pages 410-419: tens digit is '1', so no '4's.\n     - Pages 420-429: tens digit is '2', no '4's.\n     - Pages 430-439: tens digit is '3', no '4's.\n     - Pages 440-449: tens digit is '4', so that's 10 '4's.\n     - Pages 450-459: tens digit is '5', no '4's.\n     - Pages 460-469: tens digit is '6', no '4's.\n     - Pages 470-479: tens digit is '7', no '4's.\n     - Pages 480-488: tens digit is '8', no '4's.\n   - So, in the remaining 88 pages, we have 10 '4's in the tens place.\n   - Total '4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is '4' only in the range 400-488.\n   - How many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - Each of these numbers has '4' in the hundreds place, so that's 89 '4's.\n   - However, wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, but let me check: 488 - 400 = 88, so adding 1 gives 89. Yes, that's correct.\n   - So, '4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\nNow, adding up all the '4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal '4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, when I calculated the hundreds place, I considered 400-488 as 89 numbers, each contributing a '4' in the hundreds place. That's correct because 400 is included, so 488 - 400 +1 = 89.\n\nNow, moving on to the '8's.\n\n**Counting the number of '8's:**\n\nSimilarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Same as '4's, each cycle of 10 has one '8'.\n   - From 1 to 488, 48 complete cycles of 10 (480 pages) and 8 remaining pages (481-488).\n   - So, 48 '8's from the complete cycles.\n   - Now, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, '8' appears once.\n   - Total '8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each cycle of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is '8' (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n   - From 1 to 488, we have 4 complete hundreds (1-400) and 88 more pages (401-488).\n   - In each complete hundred, the tens digit '8' appears 10 times, so 4*10=40 '8's.\n   - Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), let's check the tens place:\n     - Pages 401-409: tens digit '0', no '8's.\n     - Pages 410-419: tens digit '1', no '8's.\n     - Pages 420-429: tens digit '2', no '8's.\n     - Pages 430-439: tens digit '3', no '8's.\n     - Pages 440-449: tens digit '4', no '8's.\n     - Pages 450-459: tens digit '5', no '8's.\n     - Pages 460-469: tens digit '6', no '8's.\n     - Pages 470-479: tens digit '7', no '8's.\n     - Pages 480-488: tens digit '8', so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). But wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is '8' in all of them, so that's 9 '8's in the tens place.\n   - Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so the tens digit is '8' for all of them, contributing 9 '8's.\n   - So, in the remaining 88 pages, we have 9 '8's in the tens place.\n   - Total '8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is '8' only in the range 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches '8'.\n   - So, '8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nNow, adding up all the '8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal '8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, total '4's are 188 and '8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations because 188 '4's seems high.\n\nWait, when I calculated '4's in the units place, I had 49, which seems correct because 488/10=48.8, so 48 full cycles plus 8 numbers, giving 48 +1=49.\n\nIn the tens place, I had 50 '4's, which comes from 40 in the first 400 pages and 10 in the 440-449 range in the last 88 pages, totaling 50.\n\nIn the hundreds place, I had 89 '4's because from 400 to 488, each page has a '4' in the hundreds place, which is correct.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 +89=188.\n\nFor '8's, units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0, total 98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because I thought maybe the hundreds place for '4's is 89, but let me confirm: from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a '4' in the hundreds place. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for '8's in the tens place, in the remaining 88 pages, from 470-479, the tens digit is '7', so no '8's there. Then from 480-488, the tens digit is '8', which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So that's 9 '8's in the tens place, added to the 40 from the first 400 pages, giving 49 '8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but in the first 400 pages, how many '8's in the tens place? Each hundred contributes 10 '8's in the tens place, so 4 hundreds would be 40. That's correct.\n\nSo, total '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) =98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes when counting, it's easy to make an off-by-one error.\n\nLet me recount the '4's:\n\n- Units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, '4' appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing 1 '4', so 48. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, '4' appears once, making total units '4's 49.\n\n- Tens place: in each hundred, '4' appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49). So, 4 hundreds would be 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), we have 440-449, which is another 10 '4's in the tens place. So, 40 +10=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a '4' in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nTotal '4's: 49 +50 +89=188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, '8's:\n\n- Units place: same as '4's, 48 full cycles, 1 '8' each, so 48. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have '8' once. So, 48 +1=49.\n\n- Tens place: in each hundred, '8' appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 40. Then, in the remaining 88 pages, from 480-488, the tens digit is '8' for 9 numbers (480-488). So, 40 +9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: none, as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal '8's: 49 +49=98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more '4's than '8's.\n\nWait, but let me check another way to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I can write a small table to count '4's and '8's in each position.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to think of it as:\n\nFor each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times '4' appears and '8' appears, then sum them up.\n\nWait, another way: For each digit place, calculate the count for '4' and '8'.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\n**Units place:**\n\nTotal numbers: 488.\n\nNumber of '4's in units place: floor(488/10)=48, plus if the last partial set has a '4', which it does (484 is in 481-488, so yes, one more). So, 49.\n\nSimilarly, '8's in units place: same logic, 48 +1=49.\n\n**Tens place:**\n\nNumber of '4's in tens place:\n\nEach hundred contributes 10 '4's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 4*10=40.\n\nIn the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit '4' occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more.\n\nTotal '4's in tens place: 50.\n\nSimilarly, '8's in tens place:\n\nEach hundred contributes 10 '8's in the tens place. So, 4*10=40.\n\nIn the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit '8' occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10). So, 9 more.\n\nTotal '8's in tens place: 40 +9=49.\n\n**Hundreds place:**\n\n'4's: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a '4' in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\n'8's: since the book ends at 488, there's no page with hundreds digit '8'. So, 0.\n\nNow, adding up:\n\n'4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188.\n\n'8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for '8's would have some, but no, the book only goes up to 488, so '8's in the hundreds place don't exist. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the total number of digits.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to stick with the method I used.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 more '4's than '8's.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we need to count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n### Counting the number of '4's:\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Each cycle of 10 numbers contributes one '4'.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete cycles of 10, contributing 48 '4's.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) contribute one more '4'.\n   - Total '4's in units place: \\(48 + 1 = 49\\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each cycle of 100 numbers contributes 10 '4's.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 4 complete cycles of 100, contributing \\(4 \\times 10 = 40\\) '4's.\n   - In the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit '4' appears in 440-449, contributing 10 '4's.\n   - Total '4's in tens place: \\(40 + 10 = 50\\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - From 400 to 488, each number contributes a '4' in the hundreds place.\n   - This range includes 89 numbers.\n   - Total '4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\nTotal '4's: \\(49 + 50 + 89 = 188\\).\n\n### Counting the number of '8's:\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Each cycle of 10 numbers contributes one '8'.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete cycles of 10, contributing 48 '8's.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) contribute one more '8'.\n   - Total '8's in units place: \\(48 + 1 = 49\\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each cycle of 100 numbers contributes 10 '8's.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 4 complete cycles of 100, contributing \\(4 \\times 10 = 40\\) '8's.\n   - In the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit '8' appears in 480-488, contributing 9 '8's.\n   - Total '8's in tens place: \\(40 + 9 = 49\\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - There are no numbers with '8' in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total '8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal '8's: \\(49 + 49 + 0 = 98\\).\n\n### Difference:\nThe number of '4's exceeds the number of '8's by \\(188 - 98 = 90\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{90}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I should understand what the problem is asking. Each page from 1 to 488 is numbered once, and I need to count how many times the digit '4' appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit '8'. After that, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nAlright, let's start by considering how digits are arranged in page numbers. Page numbers can be one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit numbers. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to three digits: 1 to 999, but in this case, only up to 488. So, I need to consider units, tens, and hundreds places separately for both digits '4' and '8'.\n\nI think the best approach is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each place (units, tens, hundreds) separately and then sum them up.\n\nLet me break it down into steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of 4's in the units place.\n2. Calculate the number of 4's in the tens place.\n3. Calculate the number of 4's in the hundreds place.\n4. Do the same for the digit '8'.\n5. Subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to get the difference.\n\nStarting with the digit '4':\n\n**Units place:**\nIn the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, '4' appears once in every 10 numbers. \n\nHow many complete groups of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8. So, there are 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one '4' in the units place. That gives 48 * 1 = 48 times.\n\nBut wait, in the last partial group (from 481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so '4' appears once more (at 484). So, total units place '4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n**Tens place:**\nIn the tens place, '4' appears in a sequence of 10 numbers every 100. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is '4'. So, each hundred has 10 occurrences of '4' in the tens place.\n\nHow many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 '4's in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nNow, the next hundred is 401-500, but our book ends at 488, so from 401-488, the tens digit '4' appears in 440-449. That's another 10 numbers, so 10 more '4's. Wait, but 401-488 is 88 numbers, so 401-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 '4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 401-488 is 88 pages, right? So, 401-488 includes 401 to 488, which is 88 pages. The tens digit cycles every 10, so '4' in the tens place occurs from 440-449, which is within 401-488. So, that's 10 more '4's. So total tens place '4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but wait, from 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 '4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit '4' occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. So, total 40+10=50 '4's in the tens place.\n\n**Hundreds place:**\nIn the hundreds place, '4' appears in all numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a '4' in the hundreds place. So, 89 '4's.\n\nNow, adding up all the '4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 '4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for '8's.\n\n**Units place for '8':**\nSimilar to '4's, '8' appears once every 10 numbers in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does '8' appear in the units place?\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: 488 /10=48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one '8', so 48*1=48.\n\nNow, the last partial group is 481-488, which has units digits 1-8, so '8' appears once at 488. So, total units place '8's are 48 +1=49.\n\n**Tens place for '8':**\nIn the tens place, '8' appears in sequences like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each hundred has 10 occurrences of '8' in the tens place.\n\nFrom 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 '8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nNow, from 401-488, the tens digit '8' occurs in 480-489. But our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, how many '8's in the tens place here? Each number from 480-488 has '8' in the tens place, so that's 9 more '8's.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers (including both 480 and 488), so that's 9 '8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, total tens place '8's: 40 (from 1-400) +9=49.\n\n**Hundreds place for '8':**\nIn the hundreds place, '8' would appear in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no '8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 '8's here.\n\nAdding up all '8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Wait, but let me check again.\n\nWait, in the tens place for '8's, from 1-400, it's 4*10=40, and from 401-488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 '8's. So, 40+9=49.\n\nUnits place: 48 complete groups of 10, each giving one '8', so 48, plus one more in 488, so 49.\n\nSo, total '8's: 49+49=98.\n\nWait, but let me check if I missed anything. For example, in the hundreds place, '8' doesn't appear because the book only goes up to 488. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, the total number of '4's is 188, and '8's is 98. So, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with '4's:\n\nUnits place: 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one '4', so 48. Then, in 481-488, units digit '4' occurs at 484, so +1, total 49.\n\nTens place: From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 '4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit '4' occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so +10, total 50.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a '4' in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nTotal '4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor '8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one '8', so 48. Then, in 481-488, units digit '8' occurs at 488, so +1, total 49.\n\nTens place: From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 '8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit '8' occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so +9, total 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal '8's: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of '4's printed is 90 more than the number of '8's.\n\nBut wait, let me think again about the tens place for '8's in 401-488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. Each of these has '8' in the tens place, so that's 9 '8's, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for '4's in the tens place, from 401-488, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 '4's.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct.\n\nAnother way to check: Let's calculate the number of '4's and '8's using a different approach to see if we get the same result.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nFor each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times '4' and '8' appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFor '4's: Each 10 numbers contribute one '4', so total '4's in units place is floor(488/10) + (1 if the last partial group has a '4' in units place).\n\nfloor(488/10)=48, and since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is less than 4, so no extra. Wait, but earlier I thought 484 is in the last group, so maybe this approach is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use a formula.\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is:\n\nnumber = (N // 10) * 1 + min(max(N % 10 - d + 1, 0), 10)\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think as:\n\nFor units place, the count is (N // 10) * 1 + (1 if (N % 10) >= d else 0).\n\nWait, no, that's not exactly correct. Let me think.\n\nActually, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N is equal to the number of complete decades (N // 10) plus 1 if the remainder (N % 10) is >= d.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because if N is, say, 488, then N // 10 is 48, which counts the number of complete decades. Each decade contributes one '4' in the units place, so 48. Then, in the last partial decade (481-488), we check if 488's units digit is >=4. Since 8 >=4, we add 1. So, total '4's in units place: 48 +1=49, which matches our earlier count.\n\nSimilarly, for '8's in units place: N //10=48, and N %10=8. Since 8>=8, we add 1, so total '8's in units place:48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor the tens place, the formula is a bit different. The number of times a digit d appears in the tens place up to N is:\n\nhigher = N // 100\ncurrent = (N // 10) % 10\nlower = N % 10\n\nif current > d: count += (higher + 1) * 10\nelif current == d: count += (higher + 1) * 10 + (lower + 1)\nelse: count += (higher) * 10\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to break it down.\n\nFor '4's in the tens place:\n\nWe can think of the tens digit as being '4' in blocks of 100. Each block contributes 10 '4's in the tens place.\n\nFrom 1-400: there are 4 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 '4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, from 400-488: the tens digit '4' occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so +10, total 50.\n\nSimilarly, for '8's in the tens place:\n\nFrom 1-400: 4 blocks, each contributing 10 '8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nFrom 401-488: the tens digit '8' occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so +9, total 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor '4's: From 400-488, each number has '4' in the hundreds place, so 488-400+1=89 numbers, so 89 '4's.\n\nFor '8's: From 800-899, but our N is 488, so 0 '8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, using this method, the counts are the same as before: '4's=188, '8's=98, difference=90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the number of '4's printed is 90 more than the number of '8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of '4's printed is 90 more than the number of '8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting '4's:**\n   - **Units Place:** \n     - Each group of 10 numbers (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) has one '4' in the units place.\n     - Total groups of 10 in 488: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8).\n     - Partial group (481-488) includes 484, adding one more '4'.\n     - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   \n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - Each hundred contains 10 '4's in the tens place (e.g., 40-49).\n     - From 1-400: 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40.\n     - From 401-488: 440-449 adds 10 more.\n     - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   \n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - Numbers 400-488 each have a '4' in the hundreds place.\n     - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n     - Total: 89.\n   \n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting '8's:**\n   - **Units Place:** \n     - Similar to '4's, each group of 10 contributes one '8'.\n     - Total groups: 48, plus one in 488.\n     - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   \n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - Each hundred has 10 '8's in the tens place.\n     - From 1-400: 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40.\n     - From 401-488: 480-488 adds 9 more.\n     - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n   \n   - **Hundreds Place:** \n     - No '8's since the book ends at 488.\n     - Total: 0.\n   \n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's - Number of '8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of '4's printed exceeds the number of '8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
