    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should consider how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. That means the page numbers will be 1-9 (one-digit), 10-99 (two-digit), 100-488 (three-digit). \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to get the difference. \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\n1. **Units place (the first digit from the right):**\n   - For every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484.\n   - How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n   - In each full block, there's one 4 in the units place. So that's 48 times.\n   - Now, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 is within this range, which adds one more 4.\n   - So total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place (the middle digit):**\n   - For every block of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449.\n   - How many full blocks of 100 are there in 488? There are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n   - Each full block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Now, in the partial block (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The 4 in the tens place occurs in 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 more 4's.\n   - But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's valid. So total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place (the leftmost digit):**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place?\n   - From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNext, I'll do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, every block of 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. So, 48 full blocks (1-480) and then 481-488.\n   - 48 blocks \u00d7 1 = 48 8's.\n   - In the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included. That adds one more 8.\n   - Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - For every block of 100, the tens digit is 8 in the range 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - There are 4 full blocks of 100 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Now, in the partial block (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 8's.\n   - Wait, but 480-488 is within 401-488, so yes, 9 8's in the tens place.\n   - So total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n   - So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 full blocks \u00d71 =48, plus 484, so 49. That seems right.\n- Tens: 4 blocks \u00d710=40, plus 440-449 which is 10, so 50. Correct.\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers. Correct.\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89=188. Okay.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full blocks \u00d71=48, plus 488, so 49. Correct.\n- Tens: 4 blocks \u00d710=40, plus 480-488 which is 9, so 49. Correct.\n- Hundreds: 0. Correct.\nTotal 8's:49 +49=98. Correct.\n\nDifference:188 -98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just visualize a small part to confirm. For example, in the range 1-100, how many 4's and 8's are there?\n\n4's:\n- Units: 4,14,24,34,44 \u2192 5 times (but wait, 100 is included, so up to 100, it's 10 blocks, so 10 4's in units? Wait no, 1-100 is 10 blocks of 10, so 10 4's in units. But earlier I considered 48 full blocks, but in 1-100, it's 10 units 4's. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the units place for 4's, for each 10 numbers, there's one 4. So from 1-480, that's 480 numbers, which is 48 blocks of 10, so 48 4's. Then 481-488: 484 is the only one with a 4 in units, so total 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, units: 48 blocks \u00d71=48, plus 488, so 49. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4's: each 100 numbers has 10 4's in the tens place. So 400-488: 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. So total 50 in tens place. Correct.\n\nFor 8's in tens place: each 100 has 10 8's in tens place, so 40, plus 480-488 which is 9, so 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4's from 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Correct.\n\n8's in hundreds: none, correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188. 8's:49+49=98. Difference:90.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I should probably consider how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to get the difference.\n\nLet me start by thinking about how digits are counted in numbers. Each digit's position (units, tens, hundreds) can be considered separately. So, I'll need to count the number of 4's and 8's in the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place separately and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each group of 10, there's exactly one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n\nNow, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then an extra 8 pages. So, in the units place, the number of 4's is 48 times 1 (since each group contributes one 4) plus any extra 4's in the remaining pages. Similarly, the number of 8's is 48 times 1 plus any extra 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the remaining pages after 480. The remaining pages are 481 to 488. So, the units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in the units place, there's one 4 (at 484) and one 8 (at 488). Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48*1 +1 = 49, and the number of 8's is also 48*1 +1 = 49.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, in the units place, both 4's and 8's occur 49 times each. Hmm, so the difference here is zero. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) contribute one more 4 (at 484) and one more 8 (at 488). So, yes, 48+1=49 for both. So, units place contributes equally to both digits.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times every 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), and so on up to 9 (90-99). So, in each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, for the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see. Each hundred has a block where the tens digit is 4, which is from 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times the digit 4 appears in the tens place per hundred. Similarly, for 8, it's from 80 to 89, which is another 10 numbers.\n\nNow, since the book has 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an additional 88 pages (401-488).\n\nSo, in each of these 4 hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4*10=40 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times per hundred, so 4*10=40 times.\n\nNow, let's check the remaining 88 pages from 401 to 488. The tens digits here go from 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), and 8 (481-488). Wait, actually, from 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, that's 8 numbers (481-488). Wait, but the tens digit in 481-488 is 8, so that's 8 times, right? Because from 481 to 488, the tens digit is 8, but there are only 8 numbers, so the digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place in this last partial hundred.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 401-488, the tens digits go as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0\n- 411-420: tens digit 1\n- 421-430: tens digit 2\n- 431-440: tens digit 3\n- 441-450: tens digit 4\n- 451-460: tens digit 5\n- 461-470: tens digit 6\n- 471-480: tens digit 7\n- 481-490: tens digit 8, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 numbers.\n\nSo, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and the digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, in the tens place, the total number of 4's is 4*10 (from the complete hundreds) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50 times. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the complete hundreds are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each of these contributes 10 times the digit 4 in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (441-450). So, total 40+10=50 times.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place: Each complete hundred contributes 10 times, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place (481-488). So, total 40+8=48 times.\n\nWait, so in the tens place, 4's occur 50 times and 8's occur 48 times. So, the difference here is 50-48=2 more 4's than 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me confirm. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 40 each. Then, from 401-488, the 4's in the tens place are 10 times (441-450), and 8's are 8 times (481-488). So, 40+10=50 for 4's, and 40+8=48 for 8's. So, yes, 50-48=2 more 4's in the tens place.\n\nOkay, so moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards, up to 488. So, in the hundreds place, the digits can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, since 488 is less than 500.\n\nLet me think about how often each digit appears in the hundreds place. From 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's 0. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, so it appears 100 times. From 200-299, it's 2, appearing 100 times. From 300-399, it's 3, appearing 100 times. From 400-488, it's 4, appearing 89 times (since 400-488 is 89 numbers: 488-400+1=89).\n\nWait, 400 to 488 inclusive is 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these, so 89 times.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 times. How many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? Well, in the range 800-899, the hundreds digit would be 8, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears zero times in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, the difference here is 89-0=89 more 4's than 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts from each place.\n\nStarting with the units place: 4's=49, 8's=49, difference=0.\n\nTens place: 4's=50, 8's=48, difference=+2.\n\nHundreds place: 4's=89, 8's=0, difference=+89.\n\nSo, total difference is 0+2+89=91.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct because 488-400+1=89.\n\nIn the tens place, I had 50 for 4's and 48 for 8's, so a difference of +2.\n\nIn the units place, both had 49, so no difference.\n\nSo, adding up, 89 (hundreds) +2 (tens) +0 (units) =91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is this correct? Because 488 is a three-digit number, so the hundreds digit only goes up to 4, and 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 89 more 4's than 8's just from the hundreds place.\n\nBut let me cross-verify. Maybe I made a mistake in the tens place.\n\nWait, in the tens place, I had:\n\n- Complete hundreds (1-400): 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 for both.\n\n- Then, from 401-488:\n\n  - 441-450: tens digit 4, 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n\n  - 481-488: tens digit 8, 8 numbers, so 8 8's.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 40+10=50.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place:40+8=48.\n\nSo, 50-48=2 more 4's.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nUnits place: 49 each, so 0 difference.\n\nHundreds place: 89 4's, 0 8's, so 89 difference.\n\nSo, total difference is 89+2=91.\n\nWait, but let me think about another approach. Maybe I can count the total number of 4's and 8's across all positions and then subtract.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a formula or a systematic way to count the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFor a given digit position (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times a digit 'd' appears can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor units place:\nNumber of complete groups of 10 is N = floor(488 / 10) = 48.\nEach group contributes 1 occurrence of 'd' in the units place, so 48*d.\nThen, the remaining pages are 488 % 10 = 8.\nSo, if the remaining pages are >= (d+1), then add 1, else 0.\n\nWait, no, more accurately, the number of times 'd' appears in the units place is:\n\ncount_units = (488 // 10) * (d appears once per group) + min(remaining, d) if d !=0 else min(remaining, 9)\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is:\n\ncount_units = (488 // 10) * 1 + (1 if (488 % 10) >= d else 0) if d !=0 else (488 // 10) * 1\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think for d=4 and d=8.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of complete groups: 488 // 10 =48, each contributing 1 occurrence of 4 and 1 of 8.\n\nRemaining pages:488 %10=8.\n\nSo, for 4: in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (at 484). So, total units 4's:48*1 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8: in the remaining pages, 8 appears once (at 488). So, total units 8's:48*1 +1=49.\n\nSame as before.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 100:488 //100=4.\n\nEach group contributes 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place.\n\nRemaining pages:488 %100=88.\n\nIn the tens place, the remaining 88 pages (from 401 to 488) have the tens digits from 0 to 8.\n\nFor 4: how many times does 4 appear in the tens place in the remaining 88 pages? It's from 441-450, which is 10 pages. So, 10 times.\n\nFor 8: how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? From 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times.\n\nSo, total tens 4's:4*10 +10=50.\n\nTotal tens 8's:4*10 +8=48.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 1000:488//1000=0.\n\nBut since we're dealing with hundreds place, the hundreds digit is non-zero from 100 onwards.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit cycles every 1000, but since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, for 4: from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nFor 8: since 800-899 is beyond 488, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total hundreds 4's:89.\n\nTotal hundreds 8's:0.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's total: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) =49+50=99+89=188.\n\n8's total: units (49) + tens (48) + hundreds (0)=49+48=97.\n\nSo, difference:188-97=91.\n\nWait, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. So, 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times the hundreds digit is 4. That's correct because 488-400+1=89.\n\nAnd 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, which is less than 800. So, 8's in hundreds place:0.\n\nSo, the total counts are correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97, so the difference is 91.\n\nSo, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total groups of 10: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8).\n   - Remaining pages: 8 (481-488).\n   - 4's: 48 \u00d7 1 + 1 (at 484) = 49.\n   - 8's: 48 \u00d7 1 + 1 (at 488) = 49.\n   - Difference: 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - Complete hundreds: 4 (1-400).\n   - Remaining pages: 88 (401-488).\n   - 4's: 4 \u00d7 10 + 10 (441-450) = 50.\n   - 8's: 4 \u00d7 10 + 8 (481-488) = 48.\n   - Difference: 50 - 48 = 2.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4's: 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8's: 0 times (since 800-899 is beyond 488).\n   - Difference: 89 - 0 = 89.\n\n**Total Difference:**\n- Units: 0\n- Tens: +2\n- Hundreds: +89\n- Total: 0 + 2 + 89 = 91.\n\nThus, there are 91 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should consider each digit place separately\u2014like the units place and the tens place\u2014because the number of times a digit appears can depend on its position. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, right? So from page 1 to 488, how many times does the units digit cycle through 0-9? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full cycles, with 8 pages remaining. Each full cycle gives one 4, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so there's another 4 on page 484. So total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, for the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive pages every 100 pages. So from 1 to 488, how many hundreds are there? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages in the 401-488 range. In each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.), so that's 4 times 10, which is 40. Then, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for pages 401-410, which is another 10 pages. Wait, but 401-410 is 10 pages, so that's 10 more. So total 4's in the tens place would be 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but does 488 include up to 488? So from 401 to 488, the tens digit is 4 from 401-410, which is 10 pages, and then from 411-420, it's 1, but wait, no, the tens digit cycles every 10. So actually, in 401-488, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? It's from 401-410, which is 10 pages, and then again from 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So that's another 10 pages. So that would be 10 + 10 = 20 in the 400s. So adding to the previous 40, that's 60. Wait, but that can't be right because 400-488 is only 89 pages, so the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 400-409, and 440-449. Wait, but 400-409 is within 400-488, so that's 10 pages, and 440-449 is another 10. So in the 400s, it's 20 pages where the tens digit is 4. So from 1-400, it's 4 times 10, which is 40, plus 20 in 401-488, totaling 60. So 60 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 401-488 would have 10 pages where the tens digit is 4, but actually, it's 20 because 400-409 and 440-449 both have 10 pages each. So total 4's in the tens place is 60.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. So that's 89 pages (from 400 to 488 inclusive). Each of these pages has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nSo total 4's in all places: units (49) + tens (60) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 60 = 109, plus 89 is 198. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate:\n\nUnits place: 48 full decades (1-480), each contributing 1, so 48. Then 481-488: pages 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So in units place, 484 has a 4, so that's 1 more, making 49.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages. So from 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 401-410 (10 pages) and 440-449 (another 10 pages), so that's 20. So total 40 + 20 = 60.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 pages, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 + 60 + 89 = 198.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach.\n\nUnits place: For every 10 pages, the units digit is 8 once. So from 1-488, there are 48 full decades, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit is 8 on page 488, so that's 1 more. So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The tens digit is 8 for 10 consecutive pages every 100. So from 1-488, how many times does the tens digit 8 appear? In each hundred, it's 10 pages (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So from 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So that's 9 pages. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page is between 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place in 401-488. The tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So that's correct.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 198, and the number of 8's is 98. So the difference is 198 - 98 = 100.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't overcount somewhere. For the 4's, in the hundreds place, it's 89 pages, which is correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. For the tens place, 60 seems correct as 40 from 1-400 and 20 from 401-488. Units place, 49 is correct.\n\nFor the 8's, units place 49, tens place 49, so total 98. So the difference is indeed 100. So 4's are printed 100 times more than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - From page 1 to 480, there are 48 full decades, contributing 48 fours.\n   - Pages 481-488 include one additional 4 (page 484).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49 fours.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive pages every 100.\n   - From 1-400, there are 4 sets of 10 pages, contributing 40 fours.\n   - From 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in two sets: 401-410 and 440-449, each contributing 10 fours.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 + 10 = 60 fours.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - This is 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1).\n   - Total: 89 fours.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 60 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 198.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 pages, the digit 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - From page 1 to 480, there are 48 full decades, contributing 48 eights.\n   - Pages 481-488 include one additional 8 (page 488).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive pages every 100.\n   - From 1-400, there are 4 sets of 10 pages, contributing 40 eights.\n   - From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in pages 480-488, contributing 9 eights.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.\n   - Total: 0 eights.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n198 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 100.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{100}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488. Then, I'll do the same for the digit 8 and find the difference between the two counts. That should give me the answer.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each place and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every block of 10 pages (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block, the digit 4 appears once (e.g., 4, 14, 24, etc.) and the same for 8 (e.g., 8, 18, 28, etc.). \n\nSince there are 488 pages, the number of complete blocks of 10 is 48 (because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8). So, in the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 times 1, which is 48. Similarly, the number of 8's in the units place is also 48.\n\nWait, but 488 is not a multiple of 10, so there's an extra partial block from 481 to 488. Let me check the units digits in this partial block. The units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, adding these, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because 488 is the last page, so the last block is from 481 to 488, which is 8 pages. So, in the units place, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, yes, adding 1 to each, making units place 4's count 49 and 8's count 49.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Each block of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. There are 48 complete blocks, so 48 each, and then the last partial block adds one more each. So, units place: 4's = 48 +1 =49, 8's=48 +1=49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and the same for 8 (80-89). \n\nSo, how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds. Each of these hundreds contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 times 10 is 40 for both 4's and 8's.\n\nNow, what about the remaining 88 pages beyond the 400th page? So, pages 401 to 488. Let's look at the tens digit here. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each hundred, but since we're only going up to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but we only go up to 488). \n\nWait, so from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It would be from 440-449, which is 10 pages. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that's 10 times. Similarly, 8 in the tens place would be from 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, that's 9 pages (480-488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490, but only up to 488). So, for the tens digit 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 pages. For the tens digit 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, adding to the earlier counts: 4's in tens place = 40 (from the four complete hundreds) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50. 8's in tens place = 40 (from four hundreds) + 9 (from 401-488) = 49.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because the four complete hundreds are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. So, in each of these, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4 times 10 is 40. Similarly, tens digit 8 appears 10 times in each hundred, so 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50, and 8's:40 +9=49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. Wait, no. Wait, page 1 is 1, so the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nWait, that's correct. So, the hundreds digit is 4 only for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? It's 89 times because every page from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4. Similarly, how many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, summing up the hundreds place: 4's =89, 8's=0.\n\nNow, let's total up all the occurrences.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's =49 +50 +89= 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's=49 +49 +0=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- Each block of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units digit. There are 48 complete blocks (480 pages) and a partial block of 8 pages (481-488). In the partial block, units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place:4's=48 +1=49, 8's=48 +1=49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each complete hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens digit. There are four complete hundreds (1-400), so 4*10=40 each.\n- Now, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. For 4's in tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 pages. For 8's in tens place, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages because 488 is the last page. So, 4's:40 +10=50, 8's:40 +9=49. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, which is 89 pages. So, 4's=89, 8's=0. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 +50 +89=188\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a way to double-check this? Maybe by considering another approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: As before, 49.\n- Tens place:50.\n- Hundreds place:89.\nTotal:188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place:49.\n- Tens place:49.\n- Hundreds place:0.\nTotal:98.\n\nDifference:90.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write a small program or use another method, but since I'm doing this manually, I think my calculations are correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. Pages 400-488: that's 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, 89 4's. That's correct.\n\nAnother thing to check: when counting the tens place in the last partial hundred (401-488), did I count correctly? So, 440-449 is 10 pages, so 10 4's in the tens place. 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9 8's in the tens place. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me count how many 8's are in the tens place. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 9 8's in the tens place, correct.\n\nWait, but in the initial calculation for the units place, I considered that in the last partial block, units digits go from 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place adds 1 to both 4's and 8's, making them 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nHmm, maybe 90 is the correct difference. So, 4's are printed 90 times more than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says \"how many more 4's are printed than 8's.\" So, if 4's total 188 and 8's total 98, the difference is 90. That seems correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked all the steps, so I'm confident the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each block of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n- There are 48 complete blocks (480 pages) and a partial block (481-488).\n- 4's: 48 + 1 (from 484) = 49\n- 8's: 48 + 1 (from 488) = 49\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n- Four complete hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 each.\n- Partial hundred (401-488): 4's in 440-449 (10 times), 8's in 480-488 (9 times).\n- 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 4's.\n- 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should consider how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers range from 1 to 488. So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers, and do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately.\n\n**1. Units Place:**\n\nFor the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, I can calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488 and then see if there's a partial group.\n\n488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of 10 and a partial group of 8 numbers (481 to 488). In each complete group, 4 appears once in the units place. So, that's 48 times. Now, in the partial group from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once again (at 484). So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place: Each group of 10 has one 8. So, 48 complete groups give 48 eights, and the partial group (481-488) has 88 as the last number, so that's another 8 in the units place. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so the partial group is up to 488, which is 488, so units digit is 8. So yes, 48 + 1 = 49 eights in units place.\n\nSo, so far, for units place, 4's and 8's both appear 49 times. So, the difference here is zero.\n\n**2. Tens Place:**\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit changes every 100 numbers, cycling from 0 to 9 in each ten's place for each hundred. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly for 8.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many hundreds are there in 488. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages from 401-488.\n\nIn each full hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (like 40-49), so that's 10 occurrences. Since there are 4 full hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times the digit 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place, each hundred has 10 occurrences (80-89), so 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, looking at the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, and 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? Because 480 is 4 8 0, 481 is 4 8 1, up to 488, which is 4 8 8. So, that's 9 times the digit 8 appears in the tens place in the partial hundred.\n\nWait, but let me check: 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, in the partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times in the tens place (480-488).\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 (from partial) = 50.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 (from partial) = 49.\n\nSo, the difference here is 50 - 49 = 1 more 4 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. In the partial hundred, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. For 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, yes, 9 times.\n\n**3. Hundreds Place:**\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 1 for 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and then 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (400-488 inclusive). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nThe digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the digit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\nTotal 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's in the hundreds place.\n\n**Now, let's sum up all the occurrences:**\n\n- Units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49. Difference: 0.\n- Tens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 49. Difference: +1.\n- Hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0. Difference: +89.\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: From 1 to 488, how many 4's in units place? Every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48, and then in the partial group 481-488, 484 is the only one with a 4 in units place, so total 49. Similarly for 8's, same logic, 49. So, that's correct.\n\nTens place: For 4's, each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in tens place, so 4 hundreds give 40, plus 10 from 440-449, so 50. For 8's, each hundred has 10, so 40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 49. So, 50 - 49 = 1 more 4 in tens place.\n\nHundreds place: 4's from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. 8's: none, since the book ends at 488. So, 89 - 0 = 89.\n\nAdding up the differences: 0 (units) +1 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nIs there any other place where 8 might appear? No, because the hundreds digit doesn't go beyond 4 in this book.\n\nWait, but let me think about the tens place again. From 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8, so 440-449 is 10 numbers, correct. And 480-488 is 9 numbers, correct. So, 10 and 9 respectively.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can calculate the total number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract.\n\nTotal 4's:\n\nUnits: 49\n\nTens: 50\n\nHundreds: 89\n\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n\nUnits: 49\n\nTens: 49\n\nHundreds: 0\n\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that confirms it.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **4's:** Every 10 numbers, '4' appears once in the units place. There are 48 complete groups of 10 in 480, contributing 48 '4's. The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include one '4' (484). Total: 49.\n   - **8's:** Similarly, '8' appears once every 10 numbers, with 48 complete groups and one in 488. Total: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - **4's:** Each hundred has 10 numbers with '4' in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). Four full hundreds contribute 40 '4's. The partial hundred (401-488) includes 440-449, adding 10 '4's. Total: 50.\n   - **8's:** Similarly, four full hundreds contribute 40 '8's. The partial hundred includes 480-488, adding 9 '8's. Total: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **4's:** Pages 400-488 have '4' in the hundreds place, totaling 89 occurrences.\n   - **8's:** No page numbers have '8' in the hundreds place.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488, and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nAlright, let's start by considering how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488, which is a three-digit number. So, I'll need to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nI remember that to count the number of times a specific digit appears, I can look at each position (units, tens, hundreds) individually and calculate how many times that digit appears in each position across all page numbers.\n\nLet's tackle the digit 4 first.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place.\n   - From page 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48 full blocks of 10, with 8 remaining numbers (481 to 488).\n   - In each full block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times.\n   - Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So, there's one more 4 in the units place.\n   - Total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 100 numbers. Each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for each block of 100.\n   - For example, from 0-99, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 40-49, which is 10 times.\n   - From 1-488, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n   - In each full hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so 4 hundreds give 4*10=40 times.\n   - Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490. But since we only go up to 488, the last set is 8 for 481-488, which is 8 numbers.\n   - The digit 4 in the tens place occurs in 440-449, which is within the 401-488 range. That's 10 numbers, so 10 more times.\n   - So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and so on.\n   - Wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n   - So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488. That's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - Therefore, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me think again.\n\nWait, from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers, so yes, 89 times the hundreds digit is 4. So that's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's are 188.\n\n**Now, counting the number of 8's:**\n\nI'll follow the same approach.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, every block of 10 has one 8 in the units place.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing 1, so 48 times.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits up to 8, so the last number is 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more 8.\n   - Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit appears 10 times in the tens place per block of 100.\n   - From 1-488, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40.\n   - Now, the remaining 88 pages (401-488). The tens digit here goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490). But since we only go up to 488, the last tens digit is 8 for 481-488, which is 8 numbers.\n   - The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but in the tens place, 8 appears in 480-489, but since we're stopping at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times in the tens place.\n   - So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, but 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. The hundreds digit is 4, so 8 doesn't appear here.\n   - So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up all the 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. From 401-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, which is in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times. So, yes, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, total 8's are 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's.\n\nNumber of 4's: 188\nNumber of 8's: 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting.\n\nWait, for the 4's in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times. Units place: 49, tens place: 50. So, 89+49+50=188. That's correct.\n\nFor 8's: units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for 8's would be zero, which it is, so that's correct.\n\nWait, another way to check: maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a different approach to cross-verify.\n\nAnother approach is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is floor((N + 1) / 10) * 1, plus the extra if the last digit is >= d.\n\nWait, maybe more accurately, it's (N // 10) * 1 + min(max(N % 10 - d + 1, 0), 1) if d != 0.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use a standard digit counting method.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: For each complete set of 10 numbers, there's one 4. So, total complete sets = 488 // 10 = 48, contributing 48*1=48. Then, the remainder is 488 % 10 = 8. So, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. Since 8 >=4, there's one more 4. So, total units 4's: 48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly for 8's: complete sets 48, contributing 48. Remainder 8, so 488's units digit is 8, which is >=8, so one more. So, 48+1=49.\n\nFor tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: Each complete hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, total complete hundreds = 488 // 100 = 4, contributing 4*10=40. The remainder is 488 % 100 = 88. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10=50.\n\nSimilarly for 8's: complete hundreds 4, contributing 4*10=40. Remainder 88. In the last partial hundred, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we go only up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 +9=49.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89.\n\nNumber of 8's: The hundreds digit is 8 from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because when I think about the hundreds place for 8's, it's zero, which makes sense because the book ends at 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering how digits are counted in numbers. I remember that each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) can be analyzed separately. So, maybe I should look at the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place separately for both 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nSimilarly, I'll do the same for the digit 8.\n\nOnce I have the counts for 4 and 8, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to get the answer.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in every set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48 full groups of 10 and a remainder of 8.\n   - So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 times for the full groups. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more.\n   - Total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each set of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred (401-488).\n   - In each full hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4 full hundreds give 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n   - Now, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 0 for 401-409, 1 for 410-419, ..., 8 for 480-488. Wait, the tens digit 4 would be from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But 488 is less than 490, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488. So, that's another 10 times.\n   - Wait, no. Wait, 401-488 is 88 numbers. The tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 401-488. So, that's another 10 times.\n   - So, total in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - So, total in hundreds place: 89 times.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check that again. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, that seems high. Let me check each part again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me think again. The hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 499, but our book only goes up to 488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, 89 times is correct.\n\nBut wait, when I add up units, tens, and hundreds, I get 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me see if that makes sense.\n\nWait, maybe I should double-check the tens place. For the tens place, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens digit. So, from 1-100, 40-49 is 10 numbers. Similarly, 101-200, 140-149, which is another 10, and so on up to 301-400, which would be 340-349, another 10. So, that's 4 times 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 full decades, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 4 appears once more. So, 49. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 89 times. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, that seems high, but let me go along with that for now.\n\nNow, moving on to the digit 8.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\nSimilarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Same as with 4, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of 10 and a remainder of 8.\n   - So, 48 times from the full groups. Now, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more.\n   - Total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each set of 100, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred (401-488).\n   - In each full hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n   - Now, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here.\n   - Wait, no. Wait, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here.\n   - So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. From 401-488, the tens digit cycles as 0 (401-409), 1 (410-419), ..., 8 (480-488). So, for tens digit 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 times.\n\nWait, so the number of 4's is 188 and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations because 188 4's and 98 8's seems like a big difference. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's.\n\nWait, earlier, I thought that from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, each has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. But let me confirm: 400 is included, so 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, 89 is correct.\n\nWait, but when I count the 4's in the hundreds place, I'm only considering numbers where the hundreds digit is 4, which is from 400 to 488, so 89 numbers. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, the hundreds digit is 8 only from 800 onwards, which is beyond 488, so 0.\n\nSo, the total 4's are 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but that seems correct. Hmm, maybe I was overthinking it.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 4's again. I had 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 40, and then in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but in the units place, both 4 and 8 have 49 occurrences. That seems correct because both 4 and 8 appear once every 10 numbers, and the remainder is 8, so each gets one more in the units place.\n\nWait, but when I added up, the 4's had 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's had 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The hundreds place for 4's is 89, which is a significant number, so that's why the difference is so large.\n\nWait, is there another way to cross-validate this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write a small program or use a formula to calculate the number of times a digit appears up to a certain number.\n\nBut since I'm doing this manually, let me try another approach.\n\nFor digit 4:\n\n- Units place: as calculated, 49 times.\n- Tens place: 50 times.\n- Hundreds place: 89 times.\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times.\n- Tens place: 49 times.\n- Hundreds place: 0 times.\nTotal: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 4's again. From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nIn each hundred, it's 10 times. So, 1-100: 10 times (40-49).\n101-200: 10 times (140-149).\n201-300: 10 times (240-249).\n301-400: 10 times (340-349).\n401-488: 10 times (440-449).\n\nSo, that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 times. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place:\n\n1-100: 10 times (80-89).\n101-200: 10 times (180-189).\n201-300: 10 times (280-289).\n301-400: 10 times (380-389).\n401-488: 9 times (480-488).\n\nSo, 4 full hundreds contributing 10 each, and the last partial hundred contributing 9, totaling 49.\n\nUnits place for both digits: 49 each, as calculated.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: 89 times, as 400-488 is 89 numbers.\n\nHundreds place for 8's: 0 times, as 800-888 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's: 188, 8's: 98. Difference: 90.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about a smaller number to see if my method works.\n\nFor example, let's take a 20-page book. How many 4's and 8's are there?\n\nPage numbers: 1-20.\n\n4's: Units place: 4,14 \u2192 2 times.\nTens place: 40-49, but since we only go up to 20, tens place 4 doesn't appear.\nHundreds place: Doesn't apply.\nTotal 4's: 2.\n\n8's: Units place: 8,18 \u2192 2 times.\nTens place: 80-89, but we only go up to 20, so no 8's in tens place.\nHundreds place: 0.\nTotal 8's: 2.\n\nDifference: 2 - 2 = 0.\n\nWait, but according to my method:\n\nUnits place for 4: 20 / 10 = 2 full groups, with a remainder of 0, so 2 times.\nTens place for 4: 0 (since 20 < 40).\nHundreds place: 0.\nTotal 4's: 2.\n\nUnits place for 8: 20 / 10 = 2 full groups, remainder 0, so 2 times.\nTens place for 8: 0 (since 20 < 80).\nHundreds place: 0.\nTotal 8's: 2.\n\nDifference: 0. Which is correct because in 1-20, 4 and 8 each appear twice.\n\nAnother test: 50-page book.\n\n4's:\nUnits: 50 / 10 = 5, so 5 times.\nTens: 40-49 \u2192 10 times.\nHundreds: 0.\nTotal 4's: 5 + 10 = 15.\n\n8's:\nUnits: 50 / 10 = 5, so 5 times.\nTens: 40-49 is for 4's, 80-89 is beyond 50, so 0.\nHundreds: 0.\nTotal 8's: 5.\n\nDifference: 15 - 5 = 10.\n\nWait, let's count manually:\n\n4's: 4,14,24,34,44 (units) \u2192 5 times.\n40-49: 10 times (40,41,...,49) \u2192 10 times in tens place.\nTotal: 15.\n\n8's: 8,18,28,38,48 (units) \u2192 5 times.\nTens place: none, since 80-89 is beyond 50.\nTotal: 5.\n\nDifference: 10. So, my method works here.\n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the difference is 90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we need to count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n### Counting the number of 4's:\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of 10 and a remainder of 8.\n   - 4 appears 48 times in the units place for the full groups.

From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of 10 and a remainder of 8.\n   - 8 appears 48 times in the units place for the full groups. In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 8 appears once more.\n   - Total in units place: \\(48 + 1 = 49\\) times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each set of 100, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 4 full hundreds, contributing \\(4 \\times 10 = 40\\) times.\n   - In the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, contributing 9 times.\n   - Total in tens place: \\(40 + 9 = 49\\) times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800 onwards, which is beyond 488.\n   - Total in hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nTotal number of 8's: \\(49 + 49 + 0 = 98\\).\n\n### Difference:\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\(188 - 98 = 90\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{90}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should consider each digit place separately because the number of times a digit appears can vary depending on whether we're looking at the units place, tens place, hundreds place, etc. So, I'll probably need to calculate how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and do the same for the digit 8, then subtract the two totals to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by understanding how many digits each page number has. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers range from 1 to 488. So, pages 1 through 9 are single-digit, pages 10 through 99 are two-digit, pages 100 through 488 are three-digit numbers. Wait, but 488 is a three-digit number, so I don't need to consider four-digit numbers here.\n\nNow, I should analyze each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. For each set of ten consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place, and the same goes for the digit 8. How many such sets are there up to 488?\n\nWell, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. Divided by 10, that gives 48 full sets of ten and 8 extra numbers (since 488 = 48*10 + 8). So, in each of the 48 full sets, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits are 1 through 8. So, in these, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the number of 8's is also 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that's interesting; they're the same in the units place. So, the difference here is zero. Hmm, maybe the difference comes from the tens or hundreds place.\n\nMoving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, in each block of 100 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. So, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in each 100-number block, same with 8.\n\nNow, how many full 100-number blocks are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 numbers left (401-488). So, in each of the 4 full blocks, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so that's 4*10 = 40 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 4*10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, looking at the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. Let's see: from 401 to 409, the tens digit is 0; 410-419, it's 1; 420-429, it's 2; 430-439, it's 3; 440-449, it's 4; 450-459, it's 5; 460-469, it's 6; 470-479, it's 7; and 480-488, it's 8. Wait, but 488 is only up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right?\n\nSo, in the tens place for 401-488, how many times does 4 appear? It's in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place here. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in this partial block.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 40 (from full blocks) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50. The total number of 8's in the tens place is 40 (from full blocks) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49. So, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times, so that's a difference of +1 for 4's.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is non-zero only from page 100 onwards. So, in the hundreds place, the digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, since we're going up to 488.\n\nLooking at the hundreds place, each digit from 1 to 4 appears in the hundreds place for 100 numbers each. So, 1 appears from 100-199 (100 times), 2 from 200-299 (100 times), 3 from 300-399 (100 times), and 4 from 400-488 (89 times, since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers). Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for 100 numbers: 400-499. But since the book ends at 488, it's only 89 numbers where the hundreds digit is 4.\n\nWait, so how does that affect the count? Let me think. The hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because 800-899 would be beyond 488. So, in the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times and 8's appear 0 times. So, the difference here is +89 for 4's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, yes, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. Since the book doesn't go beyond 488, there's no hundreds digit of 8. So, 8's in the hundreds place are 0.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times\n\nSo, the difference is 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the counts. Let me go through each digit place again.\n\nUnits place:\n- Each 10 numbers, 4 appears once. 488 / 10 = 48 full sets, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), 484 has a 4 in units place, so +1. So, 49 times for 4. Similarly, 8 appears once in each 10, so 48 times, plus in the last partial set, 488 has an 8, so +1. So, 49 times for 8. So, units place: 49 each, difference 0.\n\nTens place:\n- Each 100 numbers, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 appears 10 times per 100, 8 appears 10 times per 100.\n- There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, etc.), so 4*10=40 for both 4 and 8.\n- Now, the last partial hundred is 401-488. Let's count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n- 401-488: tens digits go from 0 (401-409) to 8 (480-488).\n- For 4 in the tens place: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n- For 8 in the tens place: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page), so 9 times.\n- So, total for 4 in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50\n- Total for 8 in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49\n- So, difference in tens place: 50 - 49 = +1 for 4's.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n- 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488.\n- So, 4's: 89, 8's: 0\n- Difference here: +89 for 4's.\n\nAdding up the differences:\n- Units: 0\n- Tens: +1\n- Hundreds: +89\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the total 4's were 188 and 8's were 98, which gives a difference of 90. That seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the total number of 4's is 188 and 8's is 98, so 188 - 98 = 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think if I missed any digits in the hundreds place. For example, in the range 1-399, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3, so 4 and 8 don't appear there. From 400-488, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: For the hundreds place, only the pages 400-488 have a hundreds digit of 4, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's. No 8's in hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place, as calculated, 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\nIn the units place, both have 49 each.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 50 (tens) + 49 (units) = 188.\n\n8's: 0 (hundreds) + 49 (tens) + 49 (units) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Analyze Each Digit Place Separately:**\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 numbers.\n     - Total full sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 sets.\n     - 4 appears 48 times, 8 appears 48 times.\n     - In the last partial set (481-488), 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488).\n     - Total: 49 times each, difference = 0.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n     - Total full sets of 100: 4 sets, contributing 40 times each for 4 and 8.\n     - In the last partial set (401-488):\n       - 4 appears 10 times (440-449).\n       - 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n     - Total: 50 times for 4, 49 times for 8, difference = +1.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 times.\n     - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n     - Total: 89 times for 4, 0 times for 8, difference = +89.\n\n2. **Summing Up the Counts:**\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n   - **Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should consider how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers will be from 1 to 9 (single-digit), 10 to 99 (two-digit), and 100 to 488 (three-digit). \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, it's 4; from 11-20, it's 14; and so on. So, how many complete sets of ten are there up to 488?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten and then an extra 8 pages. In each set, the units digit 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Here, the digit 4 appears in a block of ten consecutive numbers. For example, 40-49 have 4 in the tens place. Each such block contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488?\n\nThe first block is 40-49, the second is 140-149, the third is 240-249, the fourth is 340-349, and the fifth is 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, the tens place gives us 50 4's.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, in every set of ten numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, up to 488, how many complete sets of ten are there? 48 complete sets, as before, plus an extra 8 pages. Each set contributes one 8, so 48 * 1 = 48. In the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in blocks of ten numbers, like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the block. Each full block contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's count the blocks:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n- 180-189: 10 numbers, 10 8's.\n- 280-289: 10 numbers, 10 8's.\n- 380-389: 10 numbers, 10 8's.\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), so 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. That seems correct too.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems right. I think I did everything correctly.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should understand the problem clearly. The book has pages numbered from 1 to 488, and each page number is printed once. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nAlright, so maybe I should tackle this by looking at each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Since 488 is a three-digit number, I can consider each place one by one.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. That means, for each block of 10, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n\nNow, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then 8 extra pages. So, in the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 times 1 (from each block) plus any additional 4's in the remaining 8 pages. Looking at the remaining pages 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the units digit 4 appears once here (page 484). Therefore, total 4's in units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, each block of 10 has one 8. So, 48 blocks give 48 eights. The remaining 8 pages (481-488) have a units digit of 8 on page 488. So, that's one more, making it 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place.\n\nWait, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So, the difference here is zero. Hmm, interesting. So, maybe the difference comes from the tens and hundreds places.\n\nLet me move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each cycle of 100 has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit goes through 0-9 ten times each. So, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nSo, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, there are 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. Therefore, for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4*10=40 fours and 4*10=40 eights.\n\nNow, looking at the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490, but we only go up to 488). Wait, let me think. Pages 401-410 have tens digit 0, 411-420 have tens digit 1, and so on up to 481-490, but since we stop at 488, the last set is 481-488, which has tens digit 8 but only 8 pages. \n\nSo, in the tens place for the remaining 88 pages, how many 4's and 8's are there?\n\nFirst, let's check for 4's. The tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, but wait, our remaining pages are from 401-488. So, 440-449 is within that range. That's 10 pages, so 10 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, 401-488: the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490, but up to 488). So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is within 401-488. So, that's 10 fours in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. Wait, but wait, 480-489 would have 10 pages, but we only have 488, so it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the remaining 88 pages.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Pages 480-488: that's 9 pages (480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488). So, yes, 9 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, the number of 4's is 10 (from 440-449) and the number of 8's is 9 (from 480-488). So, total in the tens place: 4's = 40 (from the first 400 pages) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50. 8's = 40 (from first 400) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49.\n\nWait, so in the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 49. So, the difference here is 1 more 4 than 8.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the first 400 pages, each hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40 for each. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 fours. The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 eights. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50. 8's: 40 +9=49. So, yes, 50 vs 49, so 1 more 4.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case, since the book has 488 pages. So, the hundreds digit cycles as follows:\n\n- Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (but since we're starting at page 1, it's effectively 1-99 with hundreds digit 0, but we can consider it as 0 for the hundreds place).\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1.\n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2.\n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3.\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From page 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have hundreds digit 8, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, the difference here is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFirst, for the digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89 = 188.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 +49 +0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\n- Each block of 10 has one 4 and one 8. There are 48 full blocks (480 pages) and 8 extra pages (481-488). In the units place, the extra pages have 4 at 484 and 8 at 488. So, units place: 48 +1 =49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each hundred has 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 40 each. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449 (10 pages) and 8 occurs in 480-488 (9 pages). So, 4's: 40 +10=50, 8's:40 +9=49. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 occurs from 400-488, which is 89 pages. 8 doesn't occur in hundreds place. So, 89 fours, 0 eights. Correct.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98 =90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense.\n\nLet me start by understanding how digits are arranged in page numbers. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. For example, pages 1-9 are single-digit, 10-99 are two-digit, and 100-488 are three-digit. So, I should probably consider each of these ranges separately when counting the digits.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: pages 1 through 9. In this range, the digits 4 and 8 each appear once. So, for single-digit pages, both 4 and 8 occur once. That means the count for both is 1 each.\n\nNext, moving on to two-digit page numbers: pages 10 through 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nLet's tackle the units place first. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 9 times in the two-digit numbers. Wait, no, actually, from 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers. Each digit (0-9) appears 9 times in the units place because for each ten (10-19, 20-29, etc.), each digit appears once in the units place. So, 9 tens places, each with 10 numbers, so 9 times each digit in units place. So, for the digit 4 in units place, that's 9 times, and same for 8. \n\nBut wait, actually, from 10 to 99, the units digits cycle from 0 to 9 for each ten. So, for each ten, 4 appears once in the units place, and 8 appears once. There are 9 tens (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), so 9 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place.\n\nNow, for the tens place in two-digit numbers. The tens digit ranges from 1 to 9. For each digit, it appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for example, 4 appears in the tens place for 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place for 80-89, which is 10 times.\n\nSo, in two-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears 9 (units) + 10 (tens) = 19 times, and the digit 8 appears 9 (units) + 10 (tens) = 19 times. Wait, that seems the same. Hmm, but that can't be right because when I get to three-digit numbers, maybe the counts differ more.\n\nWait, but let me check again. For two-digit numbers, units place: 4 appears 9 times (14, 24, ..., 94), and 8 appears 9 times (18, 28, ..., 98). For the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (40-49), and 8 appears 10 times (80-89). So yes, 4 appears 19 times and 8 appears 19 times in two-digit numbers.\n\nSo, so far, from pages 1-99, the digit 4 appears 1 (single-digit) + 19 (two-digit) = 20 times, and the same for 8: 1 + 19 = 20 times. So, they are equal so far.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: pages 100 to 488. This is where it might get a bit more complicated because we have hundreds, tens, and units places to consider. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many three-digit numbers there are. From 100 to 488, that's 488 - 100 + 1 = 389 numbers. But maybe it's better to approach this by considering each digit place separately.\n\nLet me consider the hundreds place first. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book has 488 pages. So, hundreds digits go from 1 to 4.\n\nFor the hundreds place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nFor the hundreds place, how about 8? Well, 8 is larger than 4, and since the hundreds digit only goes up to 4 in this book, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times for 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, moving to the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0-9, but we have to consider each hundred separately.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to split the three-digit numbers into hundreds groups: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nLet me handle each group one by one.\n\n1. 100-199: Hundreds digit is 1.\n   - Tens place: 0-9, each appearing 10 times per hundred. So, for each digit, 10 times.\n   - Units place: Similarly, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times per hundred.\n\n2. 200-299: Hundreds digit is 2.\n   - Same as above.\n\n3. 300-399: Hundreds digit is 3.\n   - Same as above.\n\n4. 400-488: Hundreds digit is 4.\n   - Tens digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, tens digits 0-8, each appearing how many times?\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate for each digit place across all three-digit numbers.\n\nLet me first consider the hundreds place. As I did before, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, the tens place: For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-9 for each hundred, except for 400-488, where it only goes up to 8.\n\nSo, for 100-199, 200-299, and 300-399, each has 10 numbers for each tens digit (0-9), so each digit appears 10 times in the tens place per hundred. So, for each of these hundreds, 10 times each digit in tens place.\n\nBut for 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, each appearing how many times? Let's see: 400-409: tens digit 0, 10 numbers.\n410-419: tens digit 1, 10 numbers.\n...\n480-488: tens digit 8, 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page).\n\nWait, so for 400-488, the tens digits 0-8 each appear 9 times except for 8, which appears 9 times as well because 480-488 is 9 numbers. Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in 480-488, and each of the other tens digits (0-7) appears 10 times in their respective decades (e.g., 400-409, 410-419, etc.), but wait, 400-409 is 10 numbers, so tens digit 0 appears 10 times, same for 1, up to 7, and 8 appears 9 times because 480-488 is only 9 numbers.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: from 400-488, how many tens digits are there? Let's see:\n\n- 400-409: tens digit 0, 10 numbers.\n- 410-419: tens digit 1, 10 numbers.\n- 420-429: tens digit 2, 10 numbers.\n- 430-439: tens digit 3, 10 numbers.\n- 440-449: tens digit 4, 10 numbers.\n- 450-459: tens digit 5, 10 numbers.\n- 460-469: tens digit 6, 10 numbers.\n- 470-479: tens digit 7, 10 numbers.\n- 480-488: tens digit 8, 9 numbers.\n\nSo, for 400-488, the tens digits 0-7 each appear 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, now, for the tens place across all three-digit numbers:\n\n- For 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: each has 10 occurrences of each digit (0-9) in the tens place. So, 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30 times for each digit in the tens place.\n\n- For 400-488: as above, 0-7 each appear 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, for the digit 4 in the tens place: in 100-399, it's 30 times. In 400-488, it's 10 times (from 440-449). So total for 4 in tens place: 30 + 10 = 40 times.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place: in 100-399, it's 30 times. In 400-488, it's 9 times. So total for 8 in tens place: 30 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. Similar approach.\n\nFor 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: each has 10 occurrences of each digit (0-9) in the units place per hundred. So, 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30 times for each digit in the units place.\n\nFor 400-488: units digits go from 0-9 for each tens group, except for 480-488, where units digits go from 0-8. Wait, no, actually, 480-488 includes units digits 0-8, which is 9 numbers. So, for each tens group in 400-488, the units digits cycle through 0-9 except for the last group, which is 480-488, units digits 0-8.\n\nWait, let me think again. From 400-409: units digits 0-9, 10 numbers.\n410-419: same, 0-9, 10 numbers.\n...\n470-479: same, 0-9, 10 numbers.\n480-488: units digits 0-8, 9 numbers.\n\nSo, for units digits in 400-488:\n\n- For tens digits 0-7 (400-479), each units digit 0-9 appears 10 times in each tens group, so 8 tens groups \u00d7 10 = 80 times for each digit 0-9.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, for each tens group in 400-488, like 400-409, the units digits are 0-9, so each digit appears once per tens group. There are 8 full tens groups (400-409 up to 470-479), each contributing 1 occurrence of each digit in the units place. So, 8 times for each digit in the units place for these groups.\n\nThen, the last group is 480-488, which has units digits 0-8, so each digit 0-8 appears once, but 9 doesn't appear because 489 would be needed, but the book ends at 488. So, for units digits in 480-488, digits 0-8 each appear once, so 9 times for each digit 0-8, but 9 doesn't appear.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me count again. From 480-488, there are 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, units digits are 0-8, each appearing once. So, for each digit 0-8, it appears once in the units place in this last group.\n\nTherefore, for units digits in 400-488:\n\n- For digits 0-8: in the first 8 tens groups (400-409 to 470-479), each digit appears 8 times (once per tens group). Then, in 480-488, each digit 0-8 appears once. So total for each digit 0-8: 8 + 1 = 9 times.\n\n- For digit 9: only appears in the first 8 tens groups, once each, so 8 times.\n\nWait, but that doesn't add up because in 400-488, there are 89 numbers. Let me check: 8 tens groups (400-409 to 470-479) have 8\u00d710=80 numbers, and 480-488 has 9 numbers, totaling 89, which is correct.\n\nSo, for units digits in 400-488:\n\n- Digits 0-8: 9 times each (8 from the first 8 tens groups, 1 from 480-488).\n- Digit 9: 8 times (only in the first 8 tens groups).\n\nSo, for the units place across all three-digit numbers:\n\n- For digits 0-9 in 100-399: each appears 30 times (3 hundreds \u00d7 10).\n- For digits 0-8 in 400-488: each appears 9 times.\n- For digit 9 in 400-488: appears 8 times.\n\nTherefore, total units place counts:\n\n- For digits 0-8: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39 times each.\n- For digit 9: 30 + 8 = 38 times.\n\nWait, but I'm only interested in digits 4 and 8. So, for the units place:\n\n- Digit 4: 39 times.\n- Digit 8: 39 times.\n\nWait, no, because in 400-488, digit 8 in the units place appears 9 times (as per above). So, 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39 times for digit 8 in units place.\n\nSimilarly, digit 4 in units place: same calculation, 30 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: in 400-488, for units digits, 4 appears 9 times (once in each of the first 8 tens groups and once in 480-488), so 8 +1=9, right? Wait, no, in 400-488, for each units digit, it's 8 times from the first 8 tens groups and 1 time from the last group, so 9 times total. So yes, 9 times for units digit 4 and 8 in 400-488.\n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, units place:\n\n- 4 appears 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39 times.\n- 8 appears 30 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, that's the same. Hmm.\n\nNow, let me summarize the counts for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 4: 89 times.\n  - 8: 0 times.\n\n- Tens place:\n  - 4: 40 times.\n  - 8: 39 times.\n\n- Units place:\n  - 4: 39 times.\n  - 8: 39 times.\n\nSo, total for three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168 times.\n- 8: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78 times.\n\nWait, let me check that again. For 4 in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds: 89\n- Tens: 40\n- Units: 39\nTotal: 89 + 40 = 129, plus 39 is 168.\n\nFor 8 in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds: 0\n- Tens: 39\n- Units: 39\nTotal: 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nNow, adding up all the counts from single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nFirst, single-digit (1-9):\n\n- 4: 1\n- 8: 1\n\nTwo-digit (10-99):\n\n- 4: 19\n- 8: 19\n\nThree-digit (100-488):\n\n- 4: 168\n- 8: 78\n\nSo, total for 4:\n\n1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 1 + 19 = 20 + 168 = 188.\n\nTotal for 8:\n\n1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 1 + 19 = 20 + 78 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), correct.\n- Tens place: For 4, in 100-399, each hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place, so 3\u00d710=30. In 400-488, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So total 40 times. Correct.\n- Units place: For 4, in 100-399, 3\u00d710=30. In 400-488, 9 times. So 39 times. Correct.\n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 for 4 in three-digit numbers. Correct.\n\nFor 8 in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, correct.\n- Tens place: In 100-399, 3\u00d710=30. In 400-488, 9 times. So 39 times. Correct.\n- Units place: In 100-399, 3\u00d710=30. In 400-488, 9 times. So 39 times. Correct.\n\nSo, 39 + 39 = 78 for 8 in three-digit numbers. Correct.\n\nNow, two-digit numbers:\n\n- 4: 19\n- 8: 19\n\nSingle-digit:\n\n- 4: 1\n- 8: 1\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I feel like that might be correct, but let me check another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately and see if the difference is indeed 90.\n\nWait, another approach: count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place across all page numbers.\n\nBut maybe that's what I did already. Alternatively, perhaps I can think about how many times each digit appears in each place.\n\nWait, another way: For each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nIn each block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, total blocks of 10: 48 full blocks (1-480) and 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n\nSo, 48 \u00d7 1 = 48, plus in 481-488, 484 is the only one with 4 in units place. So, total 49 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 39 times in three-digit numbers, but that was only from 100-488. Wait, perhaps I need to adjust.\n\nWait, no, in my initial approach, I considered units place across all numbers, including single and two-digit. Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units place count earlier. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, in my initial calculation, for units place in three-digit numbers, I had 39 times for 4 and 39 times for 8, but perhaps that's incorrect.\n\nWait, let's approach it differently. Let's calculate the number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488.\n\nIn each set of 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so 4 appears once every 10 numbers.\n\nTotal numbers: 488.\n\nNumber of complete decades: 48 (since 48 \u00d7 10 = 480). So, 48 times 4 appears in units place from 1-480.\n\nThen, from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484).\n\nSo, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in units place: in each decade, 8 appears once, so 48 times from 1-480, and in 481-488, 488 has 8 in units place, so 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, so both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place from 1-488.\n\nHmm, that contradicts my earlier calculation where in three-digit numbers, units place for 4 and 8 was 39 each. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let's see. Earlier, I had:\n\n- For three-digit numbers (100-488), units place for 4: 39 times.\n\nBut according to this new approach, from 1-488, units place 4's are 49, which includes single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nSimilarly, units place 8's are 49.\n\nSo, perhaps I made a mistake in the three-digit numbers calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to adjust my approach. Let me try again.\n\nLet me calculate for each digit place separately, across all page numbers (1-488).\n\n1. Units place:\n\nAs above, 4 appears 49 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\n2. Tens place:\n\nIn the tens place, each digit appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n\nFrom 1-488, how many complete hundreds do we have? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, ..., 401-500, but since we only go up to 488, the last hundred is incomplete).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how many times each digit appears in the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, each digit (0-9) appears 10 times per hundred. So, for each hundred, 10 times each digit in the tens place.\n\nFrom 1-400: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times each digit in tens place, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 times for each digit.\n\nBut wait, from 1-400, the first hundred (1-100) has tens digits from 0-9, but starting from 10, so 1-9 have no tens digit, but in page numbers, 1-9 are single-digit, so their tens digit is 0? Wait, no, page numbers don't have leading zeros, so for single-digit pages, the tens digit doesn't exist. So, perhaps I need to adjust.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe it's better to consider all page numbers as three-digit by padding with leading zeros, but that might not be accurate because page numbers don't have leading zeros. So, perhaps I should consider each digit place separately without padding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate the number of times each digit appears in the tens place from 1-488.\n\nLet me try this:\n\n- For the tens place, each digit 0-9 appears how many times?\n\nIn the range 1-488, the tens digit can be considered as follows:\n\n- For the first 99 numbers (1-99), the tens digit is 0 for 1-9 (single-digit), and 1-9 for 10-99.\n\nWait, no, actually, for 1-9, there is no tens digit, so the tens digit is non-existent. So, perhaps it's better to consider the tens digit as starting from 10 onwards.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how many times each digit appears in the tens place from 10 to 488.\n\nFrom 10 to 488, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 for each hundred.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n- 10-99: tens digits 1-9, each appearing 10 times (10-19: tens digit 1, etc.).\n\nWait, no, 10-99: for tens digits 1-9, each appears 10 times (e.g., 10-19: 10 numbers, tens digit 1).\n\nThen, 100-199: tens digits 0-9, each appearing 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, 200-299: same.\n\n300-399: same.\n\n400-488: tens digits 0-8, each appearing 10 times except for the last tens group, which is 480-488, where tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, let me structure it:\n\n- 10-99: tens digits 1-9, each 10 times. So, 9 digits \u00d7 10 = 90 numbers.\n\n- 100-199: tens digits 0-9, each 10 times. So, 10 digits \u00d7 10 = 100 numbers.\n\n- 200-299: same as above.\n\n- 300-399: same as above.\n\n- 400-488: tens digits 0-8, each 10 times, except for tens digit 8, which appears 9 times (480-488).\n\nSo, let's calculate how many times each digit appears in the tens place:\n\nFor digits 0-9:\n\n- In 10-99: digits 1-9 each appear 10 times; digit 0 does not appear in tens place here because 10-99 don't have 0 in tens place.\n\n- In 100-399: each digit 0-9 appears 10 times per hundred, so 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30 times each.\n\n- In 400-488: digits 0-7 each appear 10 times, digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total for each digit in tens place:\n\n- Digit 0: 0 (from 10-99) + 30 (from 100-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 40 times.\n\nWait, no, in 400-488, digit 0 in tens place appears 10 times (400-409), right?\n\nWait, let me correct:\n\n- 10-99: tens digits 1-9, each 10 times.\n\n- 100-399: each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in tens place per hundred, so 3\u00d710=30.\n\n- 400-488: tens digits 0-8, each appearing 10 times except for 8, which appears 9 times.\n\nSo, for each digit:\n\n- Digit 0: 0 (from 10-99) + 30 (from 100-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 40 times.\n\n- Digit 1: 10 (from 10-99) + 30 (from 100-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 50 times.\n\nWait, no, in 400-488, digit 1 in tens place appears 10 times (410-419), so yes, 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, digits 2-7: same as digit 1, 50 times each.\n\nDigit 8: 10 (from 10-99) + 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 49 times.\n\nDigit 9: 10 (from 10-99) + 30 (from 100-399) + 0 (from 400-488) = 40 times.\n\nWait, but this seems inconsistent because from 400-488, digit 9 in tens place doesn't appear at all, so 0 times.\n\nWait, but let's check digit 4 specifically:\n\n- Digit 4 in tens place:\n\nFrom 10-99: 10 times (40-49).\n\nFrom 100-399: 3\u00d710=30 times.\n\nFrom 400-488: 10 times (440-449).\n\nSo total: 10 + 30 + 10 = 50 times.\n\nSimilarly, digit 8 in tens place:\n\nFrom 10-99: 10 times (80-89).\n\nFrom 100-399: 3\u00d710=30 times.\n\nFrom 400-488: 9 times (480-488).\n\nTotal: 10 + 30 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nSo, for the tens place:\n\n- Digit 4: 50 times.\n- Digit 8: 49 times.\n\nNow, units place, as calculated earlier, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\n- Digit 4: appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\n- Digit 8: does not appear in hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so 0 times.\n\nSo, now, let's sum up:\n\nFor digit 4:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89\n- Tens place: 50\n- Units place: 49\nTotal: 89 + 50 = 139 + 49 = 188.\n\nFor digit 8:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0\n- Tens place: 49\n- Units place: 49\nTotal: 0 + 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears 50 times.\n   - 8 appears 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times.\n   - 8 does not appear.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488. Then, I'll do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488, which is a three-digit number. So, I'll need to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nI'll tackle each digit place one by one for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:** I need to count how many times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. Every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9, so 4 appears once every 10 numbers. To find the total number of times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide 488 by 10 and take the integer part. That gives me 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4. So, 48 times. But wait, I should check if the last partial group (481-488) has a 4 in the units place. Looking at 484, that's another 4. So, that's an extra 1. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, how about the tens place? Every 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. From 1 to 488, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each full hundred, 10 times 4 in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? From 440-449, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. So, that's 10 more. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. From 1-399, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, so 4 doesn't appear here. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 pages (400-488). So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? It's 89 times because each page from 400 to 488 has 4 in the hundreds place. Wait, actually, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 89 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus one more in 484, so 49. Tens: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40, plus 10 in 440-449, so 50. Hundreds: 89 times. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place for 8:** Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. Now, check the last partial group, 481-488. The units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place for 8:** Every 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. From 1-400, that's 4 full hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0-8. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place here? From 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but actually, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we stop at 488, it's 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place for 8:** From 1-488, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because 800-899 would be needed, but the book only goes up to 488. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Units: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus one more in 488, so 49. Tens: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40, plus in 480-488, 9 times, so 40 + 9 = 49. Hundreds: 0. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off because I thought the tens place might have more. Let me check again. From 1-400, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each hundred, so 10 times 8 per hundred, times 4 hundreds: 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0-8. So, 8 in the tens place occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, for 4's, I had 188, and for 8's, 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. That seems right.\n\nWait, another way to check: total number of digits. From 1-488, how many digits are there? Let's see:\n\n- Pages 1-9: 9 pages, 1 digit each: 9 digits.\n- Pages 10-99: 90 pages, 2 digits each: 180 digits.\n- Pages 100-488: 389 pages, 3 digits each: 1167 digits.\n\nTotal digits: 9 + 180 + 1167 = 1356 digits.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps directly, but maybe I can use it to verify the counts of 4's and 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. For 4's, I had 188, and for 8's, 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the 4's in the tens place again. From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more, totaling 50. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, from 1-400, 4*10=40, and from 401-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 more, totaling 49.\n\nWait, but in the units place, both 4 and 8 have 49 each? That seems odd because in the last group, 481-488, units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once, and 4 appears once in 484. So, both have 49. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe using a formula or a different approach.\n\nAnother way to count digit occurrences is to consider each digit place separately and calculate how many times each digit appears.\n\nFor a given digit d and a specific place (units, tens, hundreds), the count can be calculated as follows:\n\n- Let\u2019s denote the current digit place as the position we're examining (units, tens, hundreds).\n- Divide the number into higher, current, and lower parts.\n- The count is determined by the higher part, the current digit, and the lower part.\n\nBut maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, I can think of it as for each digit place:\n\nFor units place:\n- The number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N is floor(N/10) + (1 if the last digit is >= d else 0).\n\nWait, but that might not always be accurate. Let me test it.\n\nFor example, up to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? floor(488/10) = 48, and since the last digit is 8, which is >=4, so add 1, total 49. That matches my earlier count.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the units place: floor(488/10) = 48, and since the last digit is 8, which is equal to 8, so add 1, total 49. Correct.\n\nFor tens place:\n- The formula is a bit more involved. The number of times a digit d appears in the tens place up to N is calculated by:\n  - Let higher = N divided by 100 (integer division)\n  - Let current = (N divided by 10) mod 10\n  - Let lower = N mod 10\n  - If current > d: count += (higher + 1) * 10\n  - If current == d: count += (higher + 1) * 10 + lower + 1\n  - If current < d: count += higher * 10\n\nWait, let me apply this to 4 in the tens place up to 488.\n\nhigher = 488 // 100 = 4\ncurrent = (488 // 10) % 10 = 8 % 10 = 8\nlower = 488 % 10 = 8\n\nSince current (8) > d (4), count += (higher + 1) * 10 = (4 + 1) * 10 = 5 * 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 50 for 4's in the tens place, so that matches.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place up to 488:\n\nhigher = 4\ncurrent = 8\nlower = 8\n\nSince current == d (8), count += (higher + 1) * 10 + lower + 1 = 5*10 + 8 +1 = 50 +9=59? Wait, that can't be right because earlier I had 49 for 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misapplying the formula. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the formula might be:\n\ncount = higher * 10\nif current > d: count += 10\nif current == d: count += lower + 1\n\nSo, for d=8 in tens place up to 488:\n\nhigher = 4\ncurrent =8\nlower=8\n\ncount = 4*10=40\nsince current == d, add lower +1=8+1=9\ntotal count=40+9=49, which matches my earlier count.\n\nSimilarly, for d=4 in tens place:\n\nhigher=4\ncurrent=8\nlower=8\n\ncount=4*10=40\nsince current>4, add 10\ntotal=50, which matches.\n\nSo, that formula works.\n\nNow, for hundreds place:\n\nFor 4 in hundreds place up to 488:\n\nhigher=0 (since 488 is less than 1000)\ncurrent=(488 // 100)=4\nlower=88\n\nSo, since current=4, which is d=4, count += (higher +1)*100 + lower +1? Wait, no, for hundreds place, the formula is:\n\ncount = higher * 100\nif current > d: count += 100\nif current == d: count += lower +1\nif current < d: count +=0\n\nSo, for d=4:\n\nhigher=0\ncurrent=4\nlower=88\n\ncount=0*100=0\nsince current==d, add lower +1=88+1=89\ntotal=89, which matches.\n\nFor d=8 in hundreds place up to 488:\n\nhigher=0\ncurrent=4\nlower=88\n\nsince current=4 <8, count=0\nso, 0 times, which matches.\n\nSo, using this formula, I can confirm my earlier counts.\n\nSo, 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188\n8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't double-count or miss anything.\n\nWait, another way: let's list the counts again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50=99; 99+89=188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. Up to 488, this occurs 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. Up to 488, this occurs 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in all page numbers from 400 to 488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. Up to 488, this occurs 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears 10 times every 100 numbers, plus 9 times in 480-488. Total: 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place up to 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488, and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering how digits are structured in page numbers. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. So, I'll need to consider each case separately.\n\nStarting with one-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digit 4 appears once (which is page 4), and the digit 8 also appears once (page 8). So, both 4 and 8 have one occurrence each in the one-digit numbers. That means the difference so far is zero.\n\nNext, moving on to two-digit page numbers, which range from 10 to 99. Here, each number has a tens place and a units place. I think I should count the occurrences of 4 and 8 in both places separately.\n\nFor the tens place in two-digit numbers:\n- The digit 4 appears in the tens place for the numbers 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n- The digit 8 appears in the tens place for the numbers 80 to 89. Again, that's 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nFor the units place in two-digit numbers:\n- The digit 4 appears once every ten numbers, like 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 times because from 10 to 99, there are 9 sets of ten where 4 can appear in the units place.\n- Similarly, the digit 8 appears once every ten numbers: 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's also 9 times.\n\nWait, but hold on, when I count 44, it's counted twice because both the tens and units digits are 4. But since we're only counting occurrences of the digit, each occurrence is counted separately. So, 44 contributes two 4's. Similarly, 88 contributes two 8's. So, in the units place, from 10 to 99, each digit (4 and 8) appears 9 times in the units place, and 10 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me correct that. For the units place, from 10 to 99, each digit appears 9 times because for each ten (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit appears once in the units place. There are 9 tens (10-19 up to 90-99), so 9 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, each digit appears 10 times because, for example, 40-49 has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, same with 80-89.\n\nSo, for two-digit numbers:\n- Number of 4's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n- Number of 8's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n\nSo, in two-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear 19 times each. The difference remains zero.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which range from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because we have hundreds, tens, and units places to consider.\n\nI think I should break this down by each digit place: hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book has 488 pages. So, numbers from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\n- For the digit 4 in the hundreds place: It appears in numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n- For the digit 8 in the hundreds place: But wait, in the hundreds place, 8 would require numbers from 800-899, which are beyond our book's 488 pages. So, the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place here. So, 0 times.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0-9, and we're looking for when it's 4 or 8.\n\nFor each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles from 0-9 every ten numbers.\n\n- For the digit 4 in the tens place: In each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.). Since there are four hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), each contributing 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. However, wait, for the 400-488 range, does the tens digit go up to 8? Let me check: 400-488 includes tens digits from 0 to 8, because 480-488 is part of it. So, in the 400-488 hundred, the tens digit 4 is present in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, each hundred contributes 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place: In each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (e.g., 180-189, 280-289, etc.). Again, since we have four hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. But wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 is present in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, actually, in the 400-488 hundred, the tens digit 8 appears only 9 times, not 10. So, I need to adjust that.\n\nSo, for the digit 8 in the tens place:\n- In hundreds 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: each contributes 10 times, so 3 * 10 = 30.\n- In 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n- Total for 8 in tens place: 30 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, that's a mistake. Because in each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9, so for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (like 180-189, etc.), so that's 3 * 10 = 30. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 is only present in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so total 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, for the tens place:\n- 4 appears 40 times.\n- 8 appears 39 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. The units digit cycles 0-9 for each combination of hundreds and tens digits.\n\nFor the digit 4 in the units place:\n- In each hundred, for each tens digit (0-9), there's one number ending with 4. So, for each hundred, there are 10 numbers where the units digit is 4 (e.g., 104, 114, ..., 194 in 100-199).\n- Since there are four hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n- However, we need to check if in the 400-488 range, all these numbers are within the book's page count. Since 488 is the last page, the units digit 4 in 484 is okay, so all 10 per hundred are valid. So, 40 times.\n\nFor the digit 8 in the units place:\n- Similarly, in each hundred, there are 10 numbers ending with 8 (e.g., 108, 118, ..., 198 in 100-199).\n- So, 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n- But wait, in the 400-488 range, the units digit 8 is present in 408, 418, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is the last page, so 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers, not 10. So, in the 400-488 hundred, units digit 8 appears 9 times, while in the other hundreds, it's 10 each.\n\nSo, for units place:\n- 4 appears 40 times.\n- 8 appears (3 * 10) + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the 400-488 hundred is the fourth hundred, so for units digit 8, it's 9 times, while the other three hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each have 10 numbers ending with 8. So, total for 8 in units place: 3*10 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, putting it all together for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 4: 89 times\n  - 8: 0 times\n- Tens place:\n  - 4: 40 times\n  - 8: 39 times\n- Units place:\n  - 4: 40 times\n  - 8: 39 times\n\nNow, summing up all occurrences for 4 and 8 in three-digit numbers:\n\nTotal 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 40 (units) = 169\nTotal 8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n\nWait, that seems off because 39 + 39 is 78, but let me check the math again.\n\nWait, 89 + 40 + 40 = 169 for 4's.\n\nFor 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, 4 appears 169 times, and 8 appears 78 times.\n\nNow, let's add up all the occurrences from one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nOne-digit:\n- 4: 1\n- 8: 1\n\nTwo-digit:\n- 4: 19\n- 8: 19\n\nThree-digit:\n- 4: 169\n- 8: 78\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 169 = 190\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nWait, that can't be right because 1 + 19 is 20, plus 169 is 189, not 190. Wait, no, 1 + 19 is 20, plus 169 is 189. Wait, I think I made a mistake in adding.\n\nWait, let me recalculate:\n\nTotal 4's:\nOne-digit: 1\nTwo-digit: 19\nThree-digit: 169\nTotal: 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 169 = 189.\n\nTotal 8's:\nOne-digit: 1\nTwo-digit: 19\nThree-digit: 78\nTotal: 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 78 = 98.\n\nSo, total 4's: 189\nTotal 8's: 98\n\nTherefore, the difference is 189 - 98 = 91.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the three-digit numbers, especially in the units and tens places. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, for 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, and there are 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place for three-digit numbers:\n\nFor 4 in tens place: Each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. So, 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nFor 8 in tens place: Each of the first three hundreds has 10 numbers, but the fourth hundred (400-488) only has 9 numbers where tens digit is 8 (480-488). So, 3 * 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place:\n\nFor 4 in units place: Each hundred has 10 numbers, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nFor 8 in units place: Each of the first three hundreds has 10 numbers, but the fourth hundred (400-488) has 9 numbers ending with 8 (since 488 is included). So, 3 * 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's:\n- Hundreds: 89\n- Tens: 40\n- Units: 40\nTotal: 89 + 40 = 129; 129 + 40 = 169.\n\nWait, no, earlier I had 169 for three-digit 4's, but when adding all, I thought it was 169, but when adding one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit, I had 189. Wait, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, no, no. Wait, the three-digit 4's are 169, and one-digit and two-digit are 1 + 19 = 20, so total 4's are 169 + 20 = 189.\n\nSimilarly, three-digit 8's are 78, and one-digit and two-digit are 1 + 19 = 20, so total 8's are 78 + 20 = 98.\n\nSo, 189 - 98 = 91.\n\nWait, but I'm getting 91 as the difference. But I think I might have missed something. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, from 100 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEach hundred has 10 numbers ending with 4, so 4 * 10 = 40. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, 8 in units place: 3 * 10 + 9 = 39. Correct.\n\nTens place for 4: 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nTens place for 8: 3 * 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nHundreds place for 4: 89.\n\nHundreds place for 8: 0.\n\nSo, 4's in three-digit: 89 + 40 + 40 = 169.\n\n8's in three-digit: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nAdding one-digit and two-digit:\n\n4's: 1 + 19 = 20.\n\n8's: 1 + 19 = 20.\n\nTotal 4's: 169 + 20 = 189.\n\nTotal 8's: 78 + 20 = 98.\n\nDifference: 189 - 98 = 91.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the two-digit numbers. Let me check that again.\n\nIn two-digit numbers, from 10 to 99:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Tens place: 10 (40-49)\n- Units place: 9 (14,24,...,94)\nTotal: 19.\n\nSimilarly for 8's:\n\n- Tens place: 10 (80-89)\n- Units place: 9 (18,28,...,98)\nTotal: 19.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the units place for two-digit numbers, from 10 to 99, each digit 4 and 8 appears 9 times because there are 9 sets of ten (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), each contributing one occurrence in the units place. So, 9 times each.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total difference is 91.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 91 seems a bit high. Let me see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nCalculating number of 4's:\n\n- Units place:\n  - From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, contributing 48 4's. But wait, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, the number of 4's in units place is floor(488 / 10) = 48, plus if the last partial set has a 4, which it does (484 is the last one with units 4, which is within 488). So, 48 + 1 = 49? Wait, no, that's not correct because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, and then the last set from 481-488 includes 484, which is another 4. So, total units 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 40 for three-digit numbers, but that was only for three-digit units place. Hmm, maybe this approach is better.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count each digit place separately.\n\nLet me try this approach:\n\nFor each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- From 1 to 488, how many 4's in units place?\n  - Every 10 numbers contribute one 4. So, number of 4's = floor(488 / 10) = 48, plus if the last number is >= 484, which it is, so 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in units place:\n  - Same logic: floor(488 / 10) = 48, plus if last number >= 488, which it is, so 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because in the units place, 4 and 8 each appear 49 times? But earlier, when I broke it down into one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit, I had different counts.\n\nWait, perhaps this approach is more accurate because it's considering all numbers up to 488, not just three-digit.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for 488 numbers, the number of times each digit appears in the units place is 48 full cycles (10 numbers each) plus 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n\nIn each full cycle, digits 0-9 appear once. So, in 48 full cycles, each digit appears 48 times in the units place. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so digits 1-8 each appear once, and 9 and 0 don't appear. So, in the units place:\n\n- 4 appears 48 times (from the full cycles) plus 1 time in the last 8 numbers (484), so total 49.\n- 8 appears 48 times plus 1 time (488), so total 49.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier count where in three-digit numbers, units place had 40 4's and 39 8's. Hmm, so perhaps my earlier method was wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use this digit-by-digit approach for each place.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n- 4's: 49\n- 8's: 49\n\nTens place:\n\nFor tens place, each digit appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place?\n\n- For 1-99: tens digit is 0 for 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, ..., 9 for 90-99. So, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for 1-99.\n\n- For 100-399: each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) has tens digits 0-9 each appearing 10 times per hundred. So, 3 hundreds * 10 = 30 times each digit in tens place.\n\n- For 400-488: tens digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for each tens digit 0-8, how many times do they appear?\n\n  - For tens digits 0-7: each appears 10 times (e.g., 400-409 for tens 0, 410-419 for tens 1, etc., up to 470-479 for tens 7). That's 8 tens digits * 10 = 80.\n\n  - For tens digit 8: appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place counts:\n\n- 4's in tens place: in 1-99: 10 times (40-49). In 100-399: 10 times per hundred, so 3*10=30. In 400-488: 10 times (440-449). So total 10 + 30 + 10 = 50.\n\n- 8's in tens place: in 1-99: 10 times (80-89). In 100-399: 10 times per hundred, so 3*10=30. In 400-488: 9 times (480-488). So total 10 + 30 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought in 400-488, tens digit 8 appears 9 times, so that's correct.\n\nSo, tens place:\n\n- 4's: 50\n- 8's: 49\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\n- From 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's.\n\n- From 100-399: hundreds digits are 1, 2, 3. So, 4's and 8's don't appear here.\n\n- From 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so 4 appears 89 times (from 400 to 488 inclusive, which is 89 numbers). 8's don't appear in hundreds place because 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, hundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nNow, summing up all digit places:\n\nUnits place:\n- 4's: 49\n- 8's: 49\n\nTens place:\n- 4's: 50\n- 8's: 49\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, so the total 4's are 188, and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 189 - 98 = 91. So, there's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, in the units place, using the digit-by-digit approach, I got 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nIn the tens place: 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\nIn the hundreds place: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nBut earlier, when I broke it down into one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit, I had 189 4's and 98 8's, giving a difference of 91.\n\nI must have made a mistake in one of the methods.\n\nWait, let me check the units place again.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, units digit 4 appears how many times?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, and then in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, total 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, units digit 8 appears 48 times in full sets, plus once in 488, so 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, tens digit 4 appears:\n\n- In 1-99: 10 times (40-49)\n- In 100-399: 10 times per hundred, so 3 * 10 = 30\n- In 400-488: 10 times (440-449)\nTotal: 10 + 30 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, tens digit 8:\n\n- In 1-99: 10 times (80-89)\n- In 100-399: 10 times per hundred, so 3 * 10 = 30\n- In 400-488: 9 times (480-488)\nTotal: 10 + 30 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488)\n- 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier when I broke it down into one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit, I had:\n\nOne-digit:\n- 4:1, 8:1\n\nTwo-digit:\n- 4:19, 8:19\n\nThree-digit:\n- 4:169, 8:78\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 169 = 189\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\nDifference: 91.\n\nSo, which is correct? There's a discrepancy of 1.\n\nWait, perhaps in the three-digit numbers, when counting units and tens places, I double-counted or missed something.\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, from 100-488, how many 4's in units place? Using the digit-by-digit approach, it's 40, but in the overall digit approach, it's 49 - (number of 4's in units place from 1-99). Wait, no, the overall digit approach counts all numbers up to 488, so perhaps that's more accurate.\n\nWait, but in the three-digit numbers, units place 4's are 40, which is part of the 49 total units 4's. So, maybe the initial breakdown was correct, but the digit-by-digit approach is also correct, so perhaps I made a mistake in the initial breakdown.\n\nWait, let me check the three-digit numbers again.\n\nThree-digit numbers: 100-488.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 100-488, how many times does 4 appear in units place?\n\n  - From 100-399: 3 hundreds, each contributing 10 units 4's, so 3*10=30.\n  - From 400-488: 10 numbers (404, 414, ..., 484). Wait, 404 to 484 is 9 numbers (404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484), which is 9 times. So, total units 4's in three-digit numbers: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but in the overall digit approach, I had 49 units 4's, which includes 1-99 as well. So, in 1-99, units 4's are 9 times (4,14,24,...,94). So, 9 + 39 = 48, plus 484 in 400-488, making it 49. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in three-digit numbers, units 4's are 39, and in 1-99, it's 9, so total 48, plus 484: 49.\n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, units 4's are 39, not 40 as I previously thought.\n\nWait, that's where the mistake was. Earlier, I thought three-digit units 4's were 40, but actually, it's 39 because from 400-488, it's 9 times, not 10. So, in three-digit numbers, units 4's: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39.\n\nSimilarly, units 8's in three-digit numbers: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39.\n\nSo, in three-digit numbers:\n\nUnits 4's: 39\nUnits 8's: 39\n\nTens 4's: 40 (100-199, 200-299, 300-399: 3*10=30; 400-488: 10 (440-449))\nTens 8's: 3*10=30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 480-488) = 39\n\nHundreds 4's: 89\nHundreds 8's: 0\n\nSo, three-digit 4's: 39 (units) + 40 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 168\nThree-digit 8's: 39 (units) + 39 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 78\n\nAdding one-digit and two-digit:\n\nOne-digit:\n- 4:1\n- 8:1\n\nTwo-digit:\n- 4:19\n- 8:19\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, so the correct answer is 90.\n\nI think earlier, when I was counting three-digit units 4's as 40, I was wrong. It's actually 39, which brings the total 4's down to 188 and 8's to 98, making the difference 90.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should consider all the page numbers from 1 to 488 and count how many times the digit 4 appears and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nI remember that when counting digits in numbers, it's helpful to look at each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds, etc. So, I'll need to check each place for both 4 and 8.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups and then 8 extra numbers. \n\nIn each full group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. So, for 48 full groups, that's 48 times 4's and 48 times 8's. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), I need to check if there's a 4 or an 8 in the units place. Looking at those numbers: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). \n\nSo, for the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 (from the full groups) + 1 (from the extra) = 49. Similarly, the total number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, 4's and 8's are equal, both 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. Each digit in the tens place cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. Wait, actually, no. Let me think again. From 1-100, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each for the tens place, but starting from 10-19, the tens digit is 1, and so on up to 90-99, where the tens digit is 9. So, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place over 100 numbers.\n\nBut wait, our book has 488 pages, so it's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nSo, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89, 180-189, etc.). \n\nSo, in 400 pages, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's 4 times 10, which is 40. Similarly, 8 appears 4 times 10, which is 40 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), I need to check the tens digit. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 as we go from 401 to 488. Let's see:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nWait, let's count how many times each digit appears in the tens place from 401-488. \n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does each appear?\n\nEach tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which is 8 and only appears 8 times (since 481-488 is 8 numbers). Wait, no, let me think again. \n\nWait, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) which is 10 numbers, then 1 (411-420) which is another 10, and so on up to 8 (481-488), which is 8 numbers. So, the tens digit 0 appears 10 times, 1 appears 10, 2 appears 10, 3 appears 10, 4 appears 10, 5 appears 10, 6 appears 10, 7 appears 10, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so from 481-488, that's 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8, but only 8 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place from 401-488:\n\n- 4 appears 10 times (441-450)\n- 8 appears 8 times (481-488)\n\nTherefore, in the tens place, the total number of 4's is 40 (from the first 400 pages) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50.\n\nAnd the total number of 8's is 40 (from the first 400 pages) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 48 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. Wait, no, 400-488 would have hundreds digit 4, right? Because 400 is the start of the hundreds digit 4.\n\nWait, let me correct that. Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (since they are two-digit numbers), but in reality, page 1 is just 1, so maybe it's better to consider that pages 1-99 have no hundreds digit. But for counting digits, we can think of them as having a hundreds digit of 0, but since we're only counting 4's and 8's, maybe 0 doesn't matter.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears from page 400 to 488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, the digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, the count for 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\n- 4's: 49\n- 8's: 49\n\nTens place:\n\n- 4's: 50\n- 8's: 48\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nNow, adding them all together:\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place: 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So, 48 + 1 = 49 for both, correct.\n\nTens place: First 400 pages: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40 each. Then, from 401-488, the tens digits: 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, 40 +10=50 for 4's, and 40 +8=48 for 8's. That seems right.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times. 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so 0 times. Correct.\n\nAdding up: 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. 8's: 49 +48=97.\n\nDifference: 188 -97=91.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 4's. Correct.\n\nAnother way to check: maybe I can calculate the total number of digits printed and see if it makes sense. But maybe that's overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a different approach to verify.\n\nAnother approach: For each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\nTotal numbers: 488\n\nNumber of times each digit appears in units place: floor(488/10)=48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, the remainder is 8, so digits 1-8 appear once each in the units place. So, 4 appears once more, and 8 appears once more. So, units: 48+1=49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach cycle is 100 numbers. Each digit appears 10 times in the tens place per cycle. So, 488/100=4 full cycles, so 4*10=40 for each digit. Then, the remaining 88 numbers: from 401-488.\n\nIn the tens place for 401-488: The tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times do they appear?\n\n- 0: 10 times (401-410)\n- 1: 10 (411-420)\n- 2:10 (421-430)\n- 3:10 (431-440)\n- 4:10 (441-450)\n- 5:10 (451-460)\n- 6:10 (461-470)\n- 7:10 (471-480)\n- 8:8 (481-488)\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nThus, total tens place: 40+10=50 for 4's, and 40+8=48 for 8's.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-399, the hundreds digit is 1,2,3, each appearing 100 times. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times. So, 4 appears 89 times, 8 doesn't appear in hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188\n\n8's:49 +48 +0=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 49 times (48 full cycles of 10, plus one extra for 4 and 8 in the last 8 pages).\n   \n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - Each digit appears 40 times in the first 400 pages.\n   - In the last 88 pages (401-488), 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 8 times.\n   - Total: 4's = 50, 8's = 48.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - 4 appears 89 times (pages 400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear.\n\nAdding these:\n- Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- Total 8's: 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I know that each page number is printed once, starting from 1 and going up to 488. So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the digits in the units place and then the tens place separately because each digit position can be analyzed independently.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. \n   - To find out how many such sets there are in 488 pages, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full sets with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete sets where the units digit is 4 once each, and then in the incomplete set (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once more (at 484).\n   - Wait, let me check that. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (each 10 pages) plus 8 more pages. So, in each full set, one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (at 484). So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Now, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n   - How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n   - Each full block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 blocks give 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - Now, in the last partial block (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for the numbers 401-410. Wait, no, 401-410 would have tens digit 0, 1, 2, etc., but wait, 401-410: the tens digit is 0 (401-410 is actually 401-410, but wait, 401 is 4 0 1, so the tens digit is 0. Then 411-420 would have tens digit 1, etc. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, actually, the tens digit is 4 in the range 400-409, but since our book goes up to 488, the 400-409 range is entirely within 488. So, in the partial block, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 400-409. So that's another 10 4's in the tens place. Therefore, total tens place 4's: 4*10 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but 400-409 is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, total 4's in the tens place: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, contributing 89 4's.\n\nWait, but wait: the hundreds digit is 4 only for numbers 400-499, but since our book ends at 488, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units place 49, tens place 50, hundreds place 89. So total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, no, actually, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Because the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so each of those has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 4's. So that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to counting the 8's.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to the 4's, in the units place, each 10 numbers contribute one 8. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, and then in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so that's another 8. So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - For the tens digit, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n   - There are 4 full blocks of 100 in 488, so 4 * 10 = 40 8's in the tens place from the full blocks.\n   - Now, in the last partial block (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since our book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, that's 9 8's.\n   - So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? So, 9 8's in the tens place from the last partial block.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's: units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds place 0. So total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. In the last partial block, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, 40 from the full blocks plus 9 gives 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98.\n\nNow, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to overcount or undercount.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\n- Units place: Each 10 numbers, one 4. 488 / 10 = 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (at 484). So, 48 + 1 = 49 units place 4's.\n\n- Tens place: Each 100 numbers, 10 4's in the tens place. 488 / 100 = 4 full blocks, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the last 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50 tens place 4's.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units place: Each 10 numbers, one 8. 488 / 10 = 48 full cycles, so 48. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit reaches 8, so one more 8. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Tens place: Each 100 numbers, 10 8's in the tens place. 488 / 100 = 4 full blocks, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the last 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), so 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: None, as before.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check the tens place for 8's again. In the last partial block, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 8's in the tens place from there. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 4's in the tens place, in the last partial block, 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 4's there.\n\nWait, but 400-409 is within 401-488? Wait, 400 is included in 401-488? Wait, 401-488 starts at 401, so 400 is not included. So, does the tens digit being 4 in 400-409 include 400? Wait, 400 is page 400, which is included in 400-488, but 401-488 starts at 401, so 400 is not included in that range. Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake there.\n\nWait, when I was counting the tens place 4's, I considered the last partial block as 401-488, but 400 is not included in that. So, in the tens place, the 4's in 400-409 are from 400 to 409, but since our book goes up to 488, 400 is included, but 401-409 is within 401-488. So, 400 is page 400, which is included, so the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 400 is page 400, which is included in 400-488, so yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I'm considering the last partial block after 400, which is 401-488, does that include 400? No, 401-488 starts at 401, so 400 is not included in that. So, perhaps in the tens place, the 4's in 400-409 are all within 400-488, but 400 is page 400, which is included. So, 400-409 is 10 pages, all included in 400-488, so that's 10 4's in the tens place from that. So, that part is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 pages, all within 480-488, so that's 9 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check: 480 is page 480, which is included in 401-488, so yes, 480-488 is 9 pages, each contributing an 8 in the tens place.\n\nSo, perhaps my initial counts are correct.\n\nTherefore, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98, difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to verify.\n\nAnother way is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor units place:\n\n- For 4's: As before, 48 full cycles of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1-8, so 4 appears once. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- For 8's: Similarly, 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last 8 pages, 8 appears once at 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nFor tens place:\n\n- For 4's: Each 100 numbers contribute 10 4's in the tens place. 488 / 100 = 4 full blocks, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the last 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (400-409). Wait, but 400 is included in 401-488? No, 401-488 starts at 401, so 400 is not included. Wait, so in the last partial block, 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 401-409, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 4's in the tens place, not 10. So, total tens place 4's: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 10, but now I'm seeing that it's 9. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, 400 is page 400, which is included in 400-488, but in the last partial block after 400, which is 401-488, 400 is not included. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 401-409, which is 9 numbers (401 to 409 inclusive). So, that's 9 4's in the tens place, not 10.\n\nTherefore, total tens place 4's: 4 * 10 (from the full blocks) + 9 (from the partial block) = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place:\n\n- Each 100 numbers contribute 10 8's in the tens place. 488 / 100 = 4 full blocks, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n\n- In the last partial block (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nTotal tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, so now, recalculating:\n\nTotal 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 89 (from 400-488)\nTotal: 49 + 49 + 89 = 187.\n\nWait, earlier I had 188, but now it's 187. Hmm, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, in the tens place for 4's, I had 4 * 10 + 10 = 50 earlier, but now I'm seeing it's 4 * 10 + 9 = 49. So, that's a difference of 1. So, total 4's would be 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 188 - 98 = 90, but now it's 187 - 98 = 89. So, which one is correct?\n\nLet me check the tens place for 4's again.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4's:\n\n- Each full block of 100 contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 4 blocks give 40.\n\n- In the last partial block (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 401-409, which is 9 numbers (401 to 409 inclusive). So, 9 4's.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but 401-409 is 9 numbers, right? Because 409 - 401 + 1 = 9. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 49 + 89 = 187.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 98.\n\nSo, difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 90. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's.\n\nWait, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps in the tens place, I'm missing something. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the tens place for 4's, the last partial block is 401-488. So, the tens digit is 4 in 401-409, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 4's in the tens place.\n\nBut wait, 400 is included in 400-488, but not in 401-488. So, 400 is page 400, which is in 400-488, but 401-488 starts at 401, so 400 is not included in that range. Therefore, in the last partial block, 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 401-409, which is 9 numbers. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 10 in the last partial block, which was incorrect. So, total 4's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\nTotal: 98.\n\nSo, difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 188 - 98 = 90, but now it's 89. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units place for 4's. Let me check that again.\n\nUnits place for 4's:\n\n- Each 10 numbers contribute one 4. 488 / 10 = 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48.\n\n- Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (at 484).\n\nSo, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial mistake was in the tens place for 4's, where I thought it was 10 instead of 9 in the last partial block.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 49 + 89 = 187.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's using a different method.\n\nAnother approach is to iterate through each digit position and calculate the number of times each digit appears.\n\nFor the units digit:\n\n- Number of 4's: floor(488 / 10) + (if the last digit is >=4, add 1). So, floor(488/10) = 48, and since 488 mod 10 = 8 >=4, so 48 +1 = 49.\n\n- Number of 8's: floor(488 / 10) + (if the last digit is >=8, add 1). So, floor(488/10) = 48, and since 488 mod 10 = 8 >=8, so 48 +1 = 49.\n\nFor the tens digit:\n\n- Number of 4's: floor(488 / 100) * 10 + (if the tens digit of 488 is >=4, add the excess). Wait, perhaps a better way is:\n\n- The number of times the tens digit is 4 is calculated as follows:\n\n- For each hundred block, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, in each 100 numbers, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers.\n\n- The number of complete hundred blocks in 488 is 4 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\n- Now, in the last partial block (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 401-409, which is 9 numbers (since 401-409 is 9 numbers). So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place:\n\n- Each hundred block contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\n- In the last partial block (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nFor the hundreds digit:\n\n- The hundreds digit is 4 for 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\n- The hundreds digit is 8 only for 800-899, which is beyond 488, so 0 8's.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, so now I'm getting 89 as the difference. But earlier I thought it was 90. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check that again.\n\nFrom page 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. Each of these pages has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 4's. That's correct.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct difference is 89.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to see if my method is correct.\n\nSuppose I have a 48-page book. Let's count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 4's: floor(48/10) = 4, and since 48 mod 10 = 8 >=4, so 4 +1 =5.\n\n- 8's: floor(48/10) =4, and since 48 mod 10 =8 >=8, so 4 +1=5.\n\nTens place:\n\n- 4's: floor(48/100)=0, so 0*10=0. Then, in the last partial block (1-48), the tens digit is 4 for 40-48, which is 9 numbers. So, 0 +9=9.\n\n- 8's: floor(48/100)=0, so 0*10=0. Then, in the last partial block, tens digit is 8 for 80-88, but since we only go up to 48, there are no 8's in the tens place. So, 0 +0=0.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 0 (since 48 < 400).\n\n- 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 5 (units) +9 (tens) +0=14.\n\nTotal 8's:5 (units) +0 (tens) +0=5.\n\nDifference:14-5=9.\n\nNow, let's count manually:\n\nPage numbers:1-48.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\nUnits:4,14,24,34,44 \u21925 times.\n\nTens:40-48 \u21929 times.\n\nTotal:14.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\nUnits:8,18,28,38,48 \u21925 times.\n\nTens: none, since 80-88 is beyond 48.\n\nTotal:5.\n\nDifference:14-5=9. Which matches my calculation.\n\nSo, in this smaller example, the method works.\n\nSimilarly, let's check for a book with page 88.\n\nUnits place 4's: floor(88/10)=8, and since 88 mod 10=8 >=4, so 8+1=9.\n\nUnits place 8's: floor(88/10)=8, and since 88 mod10=8 >=8, so 8+1=9.\n\nTens place 4's: floor(88/100)=0, so 0*10=0. Then, in the last partial block (1-88), tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, 0 +10=10.\n\nTens place 8's: floor(88/100)=0, so 0*10=0. Then, in the last partial block, tens digit is 8 for 80-88, which is 9 numbers. So, 0 +9=9.\n\nHundreds place: none.\n\nTotal 4's:9+10=19.\n\nTotal 8's:9+9=18.\n\nDifference:19-18=1.\n\nWait, but let's count manually.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\nUnits:4,14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84 \u21929 times.\n\nTens:40-49 \u219210 times.\n\nTotal:19.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\nUnits:8,18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88 \u21929 times.\n\nTens:80-88 \u21929 times.\n\nTotal:18.\n\nDifference:19-18=1. Correct.\n\nSo, the method works.\n\nTherefore, returning to the original problem, the difference should be 89.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 90, but now with the smaller example confirming the method, it's 89.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation by including 400 in the last partial block for 4's in the tens place, but 400 is not in 401-488, so it's not included. Therefore, the correct count is 89.\n\nSo, the answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, and hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Each set of 10 numbers contributes one 4.

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should consider each digit place separately: the units place and the tens place. Because when counting page numbers, each digit can appear in either the units or the tens position. So, I'll calculate the number of 4's in the units place, the number of 4's in the tens place, and do the same for 8's, then subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten pages (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from page 1 to 488, how many complete sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten, and then an extra 8 pages. So, in each of these 48 sets, there's one 4 in the units place, giving 48 fours. But wait, the last set is from 481 to 488, which is 8 pages. In that set, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so does a 4 appear? Yes, on page 484. So that adds one more 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place: The 4 appears in the tens place in a block of ten pages, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block contributes ten 4's in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: The first block is 40-49, the next is 140-149, then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's five blocks. Each block contributes ten 4's, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, because 440 is page 440, and 449 is page 449, which is before 488. So, that's correct, five blocks, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nSo total 4's are units (49) + tens (50) = 99.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's. Starting with the units place: In each set of ten pages, the digit 8 appears once in the units place, like 8, 18, 28, etc. From 1 to 488, how many complete sets of ten are there? As before, 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48 eights. Now, the last partial set is 481-488, which has units digits from 1 to 8. So, 8 appears once here, on page 488. So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place for 8's: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 pages instead of ten. So, how many such blocks are there? Let's count:\n\n1. 80-89: 10 pages\n2. 180-189: 10 pages\n3. 280-289: 10 pages\n4. 380-389: 10 pages\n5. 480-488: 9 pages\n\nSo that's five blocks, but the last one only has 9 pages. Now, in each of the first four blocks, the tens digit is 8 for ten pages, so each contributes ten 8's in the tens place. So that's 4 * 10 = 40. The last block, 480-488, has the tens digit 8 for pages 480-488. That's 9 pages, so 9 eights in the tens place. So total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo total 8's are units (49) + tens (49) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. The blocks are:\n\n- 80-89: 10 pages, so 10 eights in tens place.\n- 180-189: same, 10.\n- 280-289: same, 10.\n- 380-389: same, 10.\n- 480-488: 9 pages, so 9 eights.\n\nSo that's 4*10 + 9 = 49, correct.\n\nSo total 4's: 99, total 8's: 98. So the difference is 99 - 98 = 1. So there's one more 4 than 8.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, in the units place for 4's, I had 48 complete sets of ten, each contributing one 4, and then the last set had one more 4 on page 484, making 49. That seems right.\n\nIn the tens place for 4's, I had five blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each contributes ten 4's, so 5*10=50. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 48 complete sets, each with one 8, plus the last set having one more on 488, so 49.\n\nTens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So five blocks, but the last one has only 9 pages. So 4*10 +9=49. So total 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nSo 4's:99, 8's:98, difference is 1.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe I missed something. Let me recount the tens place for 4's.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\n- 40-49: 10 times\n- 140-149:10\n- 240-249:10\n- 340-349:10\n- 440-449:10\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks, each contributing ten 4's, so 5*10=50. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, the blocks are:\n\n- 80-89:10\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nSo that's 4*10 +9=49. So 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9 eights in the tens place. So total 49.\n\nSo 4's:99, 8's:98. So the answer should be 1 more 4 than 8.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe by actually writing out the counts.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) =48, plus if the last digit is >=4, which it is (since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4), so 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's: floor(488/10)=48, plus if the last digit >=8, which it is (8), so 48 +1=49.\n\nFor tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100)=4, which gives the number of complete hundreds. Each hundred contributes one block of ten where the tens digit is 4, so 4*10=40. Now, the remaining pages are 488 - 400 =88 pages. So in the hundreds place, we have 400-488. The tens digit in this range can be 0-8. So the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So total tens place 4's:4*10 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place:\n\nfloor(488/100)=4, so 4 blocks of ten where tens digit is 8: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Now, the remaining pages are 488 - 400=88. So in the range 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 pages. So total tens place 8's:40 +9=49.\n\nSo total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens)=99.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)=98.\n\nDifference:99-98=1.\n\nSo the answer is 1 more 4 than 8.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because sometimes when I do these problems, I might have miscounted the last partial block. Let me verify.\n\nIn the units place for 4's: From 1 to 488, every 10 pages, 4 appears once. So 488/10=48.8, so 48 full tens, and 8 extra pages. The 48 full tens contribute 48 fours, and in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once on 484. So total units 4's:49.\n\nSimilarly, units 8's: same logic, 48 full tens, 48 eights, and in the last 8 pages, 8 appears once on 488. So units 8's:49.\n\nTens place 4's: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's five blocks, each contributing 10, so 50.\n\nTens place 8's:80-89:10,180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. So 4 blocks of 10 and one of 9, totaling 49.\n\nSo yes, 4's total 99, 8's total 98, difference 1.\n\nI think that's correct. So the answer should be 1.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 99 and the number of 8's is 98, so there is one more 4 than 8.\n\n$\\boxed{1}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should figure out how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488, and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to get the difference. That makes sense, right?\n\nLet me start by considering how digits are structured in page numbers. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 up to 488. So, I need to account for all these numbers.\n\nI remember that when dealing with digit counts, it's helpful to break it down by the units place, tens place, and hundreds place separately. So, I'll calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each of these positions.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, I can figure out how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488. That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does that mean 48 times? Let me check. From 1 to 480, there are 48 groups of 10, so 48 fours in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so no additional 4's there. So, 48 fours in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me count how many such groups there are. From 1-400, there are 4 groups (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349). Each group contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 4 groups \u00d7 10 = 40 fours. Now, from 440-449, that's another group, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10 fours. So, total for tens place would be 5 groups \u00d7 10 = 50 fours? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 40-49 is one group, then 140-149 is another, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 groups. Each group has 10 numbers, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, but wait, 440-449 is part of the 400-488 range, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, but wait, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, right? Let me check: 488 - 400 = 88, so plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up the fours in each place:\n\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\n\nTotal fours: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nWait, let me double-check that addition. 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. Yep.\n\nNow, moving on to the digit 8.\n\nAgain, I'll break it down into units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers, similar to 4. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, from 1 to 480, that's 48 groups, so 48 eights. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go up to 8, so that's another 8 in 488. So, total units place eights: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, let me think. 488 is included, so the units digit is 8 in 488, so that's one more. So, 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, how many such groups are there?\n\nFrom 1-400, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, which is 4 groups. Each group contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights.\n\nNow, from 480-488, that's another group where the tens digit is 8. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 eights in the tens place. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 10, but since 488 is the last page, it's only 9 numbers. So, that group contributes 9 eights.\n\nWait, but wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, the tens place eights from 480-488 is 9.\n\nSo, total tens place eights: 4 groups \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yep, that's correct.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up the eights in each place:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems a bit low, but let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so 98 total eights.\n\nWait, but wait a second, in the tens place, I considered 480-488 as contributing 9 eights, but is that correct? Let me think. From 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for all those numbers, right? So, 480, 481, ..., 488: that's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, 9 eights there. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nNow, let me compare the totals. Number of fours: 187. Number of eights:98.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations because 89 seems quite a big difference.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the fours in the hundreds place. Let me go back.\n\nFor the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nFor the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's another group. So, that's 5 groups, each contributing 10 fours, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. That's correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 fours, as calculated earlier. So, 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor the eights, units place: 49, tens place:49, so 98. That seems correct too.\n\nSo, 187 fours minus 98 eights is 89 more fours.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that I overcounted or undercounted somewhere?\n\nWait, for the units place of fours: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 times, but since 488 is included, does that add another 4? Wait, no, because 488 ends with 8, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484, which is 484, so 484 is the 48th occurrence. So, units place fours:48.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. Then 140-149: another 10, etc. So, 5 groups, 5\u00d710=50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 89 fours. Correct.\n\nEights: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. So, 98 eights.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the difference might be smaller. Let me check with a smaller example to see if my method is correct.\n\nSuppose I have a book with 20 pages. How many fours and eights?\n\nPage numbers 1-20.\n\nFours: in units place: 4,14: 2 fours.\n\nIn tens place: 40-49, but we only go up to 20, so no fours in tens place.\n\nHundreds place: none.\n\nTotal fours:2.\n\nEights: in units place:8,18:2 eights.\n\nIn tens place:80-89, but we only go up to 20, so none.\n\nHundreds place: none.\n\nTotal eights:2.\n\nDifference:2-2=0. That seems correct.\n\nAnother example: 100 pages.\n\nFours:\n\nUnits:100/10=10 fours.\n\nTens:10-19, 40-49, 70-79, 100-109? Wait, no, up to 100.\n\nWait, no, in 1-100, the tens place fours are in 40-49:10 fours.\n\nHundreds place: none, since 100 is the last page, but hundreds digit is 1, so no fours.\n\nTotal fours:10 (units) +10 (tens)=20.\n\nEights:\n\nUnits:100/10=10 eights.\n\nTens:80-89:10 eights.\n\nHundreds: none.\n\nTotal eights:10+10=20.\n\nDifference:0. That makes sense.\n\nWait, but in my original problem, the difference is 89. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should check another example to see if my method is correct.\n\nLet's take 50 pages.\n\nFours:\n\nUnits:5 fours (4,14,24,34,44).\n\nTens:40-49:10 fours.\n\nHundreds: none.\n\nTotal fours:5+10=15.\n\nEights:\n\nUnits:5 eights (8,18,28,38,48).\n\nTens:40-49: but wait, 40-49 is in tens place, but that's fours, not eights. For eights in tens place, it's 80-89, which is beyond 50, so none.\n\nSo, eights in tens place:0.\n\nHundreds:0.\n\nTotal eights:5.\n\nDifference:15-5=10.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nSo, in 50 pages, fours are 15, eights are5, difference is10.\n\nSo, my method seems to work.\n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, 488 pages, fours:187, eights:98, difference:89.\n\nWait, but let me check again.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, for fours, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's five groups, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Correct.\n\nUnits place:48 fours. Correct.\n\nFor eights, units place:49, tens place:49, so 98. Correct.\n\nSo, 187-98=89.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure because 89 seems like a large number. Let me try to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of fours and eights in each digit place separately and sum them up.\n\nWait, another way: for each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), count the number of fours and eights.\n\nSo, for units place:\n\n- Fours: floor(488/10) = 48. But since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so we add 1? Wait, no, that's for counting numbers >= a certain value. Wait, actually, the number of fours in units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus 1 if the remainder is >=4. Wait, no, actually, for units digit, the count is floor((n + 1)/10) for each digit.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think as follows:\n\nFor units digit, the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to n is:\n\ncount = (n // 10) + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nBut for digits 0-9, except for the first digit, which can't be zero.\n\nWait, but in our case, page numbers start from 1, so units digit can be 0, but in page 10, units digit is 0, but we don't count 0 as a digit we're interested in. So, maybe this formula works for digits 1-9.\n\nSo, for digit 4 in units place:\n\ncount = (488 // 10) + (1 if (488 % 10) >=4 else 0)\n\n488 //10 =48, 488%10=8, which is >=4, so count=48+1=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, this is conflicting.\n\nWait, let me check with n=488.\n\nUsing this formula, for digit 4 in units place:\n\ncount = 48 +1=49.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 48 because 484 is the last number with 4 in units place before 488.\n\nWait, but 488 is 488, so the units digits go up to 8, so 4 appears in 4,14,24,...,484, which is 48 numbers, right? Because 484 is the 48th occurrence.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, it's 48 +1=49. That suggests that 4 appears 49 times in the units place from 1 to 488.\n\nWait, but 488//10=48, and 488%10=8, which is >=4, so add 1, making it 49.\n\nBut when I list them, 4,14,24,...,484: that's 48 numbers because 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4. So, 48 numbers.\n\nWait, so which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the formula counts 0 as a valid digit, but in page numbers, the first page is 1, so 0 doesn't appear in the units place until page 10, which is page 10, but 10 is included.\n\nWait, but in page 10, units digit is 0, but we're interested in digit 4, so 0 isn't relevant here.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is correct, and I was wrong earlier.\n\nWait, let me test with a small n.\n\nSay n=14.\n\nUsing the formula: count =14//10=1, and 14%10=4 >=4, so count=1+1=2.\n\nIndeed, in 1-14, the units digit 4 appears at 4 and 14, which is 2 times. So, formula works.\n\nSimilarly, for n=488:\n\ncount=488//10=48, 488%10=8 >=4, so 48+1=49.\n\nSo, units digit 4 appears 49 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 48. So, I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me recount.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place?\n\nThey are 4,14,24,...,484,494. Wait, but 494 is beyond 488, so the last one is 484.\n\nSo, how many terms are there?\n\nThe sequence is 4,14,24,...,484.\n\nThis is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 10.\n\nThe nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 10n -6.\n\nSet 10n -6 <=484.\n\n10n <=490 => n<=49.\n\nSo, n=49.\n\nSo, 49 terms.\n\nWait, so that means 49 fours in the units place.\n\nBut earlier, I thought 484 was the 48th term. Wait, no, 4 is the first term (n=1), 14 is n=2, ..., 484 is n=49.\n\nSo, 49 fours in the units place.\n\nSo, I must have made a mistake earlier by thinking it was 48. So, units place fours:49.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in units place:\n\ncount=488//10=48, 488%10=8 >=8, so count=48+1=49.\n\nWhich matches my earlier count.\n\nSo, units place fours:49, eights:49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nFor tens digit 4:\n\nWe need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place from 1 to 488.\n\nThe tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449.\n\nEach of these ranges has 10 numbers, so 10 fours per range.\n\nHow many such ranges are there?\n\nFrom 0-400, we have 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349: that's 4 ranges.\n\nThen, from 400-488, we have 440-449: that's another range, but only up to 449, which is within 488.\n\nSo, total of 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours.\n\nSo, 5\u00d710=50 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check using the formula.\n\nFor the tens digit, the formula is a bit different.\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to n is:\n\ncount = (n // 100) \u00d7 10 + min(max(n % 100 - d*10 +1, 0), 10)\n\nWait, maybe that's too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9, so for each hundred, the digit d appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, for 488, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100,101-200,201-300,301-400), and then 401-488.\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears once in the tens place, for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49 in each hundred).\n\nSo, 4 complete hundreds \u00d710=40 fours.\n\nNow, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but since 488 is less than 499, we have all 10 numbers from 440-449.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10 fours.\n\nSo, total tens place fours:40 +10=50.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place:\n\nThe ranges are 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-489.\n\nBut since our book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, how many ranges?\n\nFrom 1-400: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389:4 ranges, each contributing 10 eights.\n\nThen, from 401-488:480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total tens place eights:4\u00d710 +9=49.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nFor fours, as before, 400-488:89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nFor eights, since 800-899 would be required, but our book only goes up to 488, so no eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, hundreds place fours:89, eights:0.\n\nNow, summing up:\n\nFours:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was 187, but now it's 188. Wait, which is correct?\n\nWait, in the units place, I now have 49 fours, not 48. So, 49+50+89=188.\n\nSimilarly, eights:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 89. Hmm, so where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, let's recount the fours:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:50\n\nHundreds:89\n\nTotal:49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nEights:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so earlier I must have miscounted the units place fours as 48 instead of 49.\n\nSo, the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check again.\n\nWait, using the formula for units digit, for digit 4, it's 488//10=48, 488%10=8>=4, so 48+1=49. So, units place fours:49.\n\nSimilarly, for eights, units place:49.\n\nTens place fours:50, tens place eights:49.\n\nHundreds place fours:89, hundreds place eights:0.\n\nSo, total fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 89. So, I must have made a mistake in the units place count initially.\n\nSo, the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again.\n\nWait, in the units place, from 1 to 488, how many fours are there?\n\nThey are 4,14,24,...,484,494. But 494 is beyond 488, so the last one is 484.\n\nSo, how many terms?\n\nThe first term is 4, which is 4 + 0\u00d710.\n\nThe second term is 14=4+1\u00d710.\n\n...\n\nThe nth term is 4 + (n-1)\u00d710 <=488.\n\nSo, 4 +10(n-1) <=488.\n\n10(n-1) <=484.\n\nn-1 <=48.4.\n\nn<=49.4.\n\nSo, n=49.\n\nSo, 49 terms.\n\nThus, units place fours:49.\n\nSimilarly, for eights, units place:49.\n\nTens place fours:50.\n\nTens place eights:49.\n\nHundreds place fours:89.\n\nHundreds place eights:0.\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 488//10=48, and 488%10=8>=4, so 49 fours. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought it was 89, but now I'm getting 90. I think the correct answer is 90.\n\nWait, let me check with another method.\n\nAnother way to count the number of times a digit appears is to consider each digit position separately and calculate how many times each digit appears in that position.\n\nFor a 3-digit number, we can break it down into hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nBut since our book has up to 488 pages, we can consider numbers from 001 to 488, padding with leading zeros to make them 3-digit numbers. This way, each number has a hundreds, tens, and units digit, making it easier to count.\n\nSo, for each digit position (hundreds, tens, units), we can calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with the units digit:\n\n- For units digit, as before, the count for 4 is 49 and for 8 is49.\n\nTens digit:\n\n- For tens digit, as before, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears49 times.\n\nHundreds digit:\n\n- For hundreds digit, 4 appears from 400-488, which is89 times. 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because I initially thought 89, but after correcting the units place count, it's 90.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, and the remainder is 8, which is \u22654, so we add 1).\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit 4 appears in numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\n   **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** Similarly, 8 appears 49 times.\n   - **Tens Place:** Ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., contribute 4 full ranges (40 each) and the partial range 480-488 (9 numbers), totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No occurrences since the book doesn't reach 800.\n\n   **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe digit 4 is printed 90 more times than the digit 8.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That makes sense because the number of times a digit appears in each place can be calculated independently. So, I'll start by looking at the units place, then the tens place, and finally the hundreds place.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten pages (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. Similarly, the digit 8 also appears once in each set of ten. So, for the units place, the number of 4's and 8's should be the same. Now, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of ten and then 8 extra pages. In those 48 sets, each digit (4 and 8) appears 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial set, the units digit 4 appears once, and 8 appears once as well. So, for the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's. So, they're equal in the units place.\n\nNext, moving on to the tens place: Here, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive pages, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive pages, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place?\n\nFor the digit 4 in the tens place: The first occurrence is from 40-49, which is 10 pages. Then, the next occurrence would be 140-149, which is another 10 pages, and then 240-249, and 340-349. Wait, but since the book only has 488 pages, 340-349 is okay, but 440-449 would be pages 440-449, which is still within 488, right? So, that's another 10 pages. Let me count: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 times for the digit 4 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is 440 to 449, which is 10 pages, so that's correct. But 488 is the last page, so after 449, we have pages up to 488, but the next set would be 540-549, which is beyond 488, so we don't count that. So, only 5 sets, so 50 times.\n\nNow, for the digit 8 in the tens place: Similarly, it appears in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 pages, not 10. So, for the 480-489 range, only pages 480-488 are present, which is 9 pages. So, that's 9 times instead of 10. So, the digit 8 in the tens place appears 4 times 10 and once 9, totaling 4*10 +9=49 times.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 80-89: 10 pages, so 10 times. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Then, 480-488: 9 pages. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49 times. So, digit 8 appears 49 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, in the tens place, digit 4 appears 50 times, and digit 8 appears 49 times. So, 50-49=1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's see when the hundreds digit is 4. That would be from page 400 to 488. So, how many pages is that? 488-400+1=89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times.\n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit can't be 8 because 800 is beyond 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the digit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, digit 4 appears 89 times, and digit 8 appears 0 times. So, that's 89 more 4's than 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each place:\n\n- Units place: 4's=49, 8's=49 \u2192 difference 0\n- Tens place: 4's=50, 8's=49 \u2192 difference +1\n- Hundreds place: 4's=89, 8's=0 \u2192 difference +89\n\nTotal difference: 0 +1 +89=90\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check each step.\n\nWait, in the units place, I said 48 full tens and then 8 pages. So, 48*1=48 for each digit, plus 1 each in the partial set, making 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, digit 4: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, so 50 times. Correct.\n\nDigit 8 in tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49. Correct.\n\nIn hundreds place, digit 4: pages 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times. Correct. Digit 8: none, so 0.\n\nSo, the differences:\n\n- Units: 0\n- Tens: +1\n- Hundreds: +89\nTotal: 0+1+89=90\n\nSo, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly for the hundreds place. Pages 400-488: 488-400+1=89 pages. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about the hundreds place: For each hundred, the hundreds digit is 1,2,3,4. So, from 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, but we don't count that. From 100-199: hundreds digit is 1. 200-299: 2. 300-399:3. 400-488:4. So, digit 4 appears in the hundreds place only from 400-488, which is 89 times. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the total difference is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the tens place. So, for the digit 8 in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9 times. So, 4 times 10 and 9, total 49. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full sets (480 pages) + 8 extra pages.\n   - Count of 4's: 48 (from full sets) + 1 (from 484) = 49.\n   - Count of 8's: 48 (from full sets) + 1 (from 488) = 49.\n   - Difference in units place: 49 - 49 = 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Count of 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 5 sets \u00d710 = 50.\n   - Count of 8's: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 4 sets \u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n   - Difference in tens place: 50 - 49 = 1.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Digit 4 appears from page 400 to 488: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 times.\n   - Digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place within 488 pages.\n   - Difference in hundreds place: 89 - 0 = 89.\n\n4. **Total Difference:**\n   - Units: 0\n   - Tens: +1\n   - Hundreds: +89\n   - Total: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should understand how page numbers are structured. Each page number is a three-digit number, right? Wait, no, actually, page numbers start at 1 and go up to 488, so they can be one, two, or three digits. But when we talk about digits, we're considering each individual number in the page number, so for example, page 1 is just '1', page 10 is '1' and '0', and page 100 is '1', '0', '0', and so on up to page 488.\n\nSo the problem is asking how many times the digit '4' appears in all the page numbers compared to how many times '8' appears. The difference between these two counts will be the answer.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to count the number of times '4' appears in each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately and then do the same for '8'. Then, subtract the total number of '8's from the total number of '4's to find how many more '4's there are.\n\nLet's start by considering each digit position one by one.\n\nFirst, let's handle the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles through 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 pages, the digit '4' appears exactly once in the units place, and the same goes for '8'. \n\nBut wait, the book has 488 pages, so the units digit cycles 48 times (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full cycles of 10 and then 8 extra pages). Wait, no, actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so there are 48 full cycles of 10 pages each, and then 8 additional pages (481 to 488). \n\nIn each full cycle of 10, '4' appears once in the units place, so for 48 cycles, that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits are 1 through 8. So '4' appears once more in the units place, making the total number of '4's in the units place 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for '8's in the units place, each full cycle of 10 has one '8', so 48 times, and in the remaining 8 pages, the units digits go up to 8, so '8' appears once more. So total '8's in units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so the last page is 488, which is included in the 488 pages. So, let me check that again. Each full cycle of 10 pages (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) contributes one '4' and one '8' in the units place. So 48 full cycles would give 48 '4's and 48 '8's. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8, so '4' appears once, and '8' appears once. So total '4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49, and '8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So they are equal in the units place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. For example, pages 1-10: units digits are 1-0, so '4' is at page 4, and '8' at page 8. Pages 11-20: '4' at 14, '8' at 18, and so on. So each full 10 pages contribute one '4' and one '8' in the units place. So 48 full cycles: 48 '4's and 48 '8's. Then, pages 481-488: units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So '4' appears at 484 and '8' at 488. So that's one more '4' and one more '8', making the totals 49 each. So yes, in units place, they are equal.\n\nNext, let's move to the tens place. Here, the digit '4' and '8' can appear in the tens position. Each time the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, ..., up to 9 for 90-99. So, in each block of 100 pages, the tens digit is '4' for 10 pages (40-49) and '8' for 10 pages (80-89). \n\nSo, how many full blocks of 100 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages left (401-488). \n\nIn each full block of 100, '4' appears 10 times in the tens place, and '8' also appears 10 times. So for 4 full blocks, that's 4*10=40 '4's and 4*10=40 '8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's look at the remaining 88 pages: 401-488. The tens digit here cycles from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in the tens place, we have:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 481-488 is 8 pages, not 10. So in the tens place, how many times does '4' and '8' appear?\n\nLooking at the tens digit in 401-488:\n\n- '4' in tens place occurs in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 '4's.\n- '8' in tens place occurs in 481-490, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 8 pages (481-488), so the tens digit is '8' for 8 pages, meaning 8 '8's.\n\nWait, but wait, 481-488 is 8 pages, so the tens digit is '8' for those 8 pages. So in the tens place, '4' appears 10 times, and '8' appears 8 times.\n\nSo, adding that to the full blocks:\n\nTotal '4's in tens place: 40 (from 4 blocks) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50\nTotal '8's in tens place: 40 (from 4 blocks) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48\n\nWait, that seems correct. So in the tens place, '4' appears 50 times and '8' appears 48 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be '4' or '8' as well. Let's see.\n\nIn the hundreds place, the digit is '4' for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the hundreds digit is '4' for 89 pages, meaning '4' appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about '8' in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit can be '1', '2', '3', '4'. There's no page where the hundreds digit is '8' because 800 is beyond 488. So '8' never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, '8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Units place:\n  - '4's: 49\n  - '8's: 49\n\n- Tens place:\n  - '4's: 50\n  - '8's: 48\n\n- Hundreds place:\n  - '4's: 89\n  - '8's: 0\n\nNow, let's add them all up for each digit.\n\nTotal '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal '8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nSo, the number of '4's is 188, and the number of '8's is 97. The difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place: 488 pages, so 48 full tens and 8 extra. Each full ten contributes one '4' and one '8', so 48 each. Then, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so '4' once and '8' once. So units total '4's: 48 +1=49; same for '8's.\n\nTens place: 488 pages. Each 100 pages contribute 10 '4's and 10 '8's in the tens place. So 4 full hundreds (1-400) contribute 4*10=40 '4's and 4*10=40 '8's. Then, the remaining 88 pages (401-488). In these, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. '4' appears in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 '4's. '8' appears in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 '8's. So total '4's in tens: 40 +10=50; '8's:40 +8=48.\n\nHundreds place: '4' appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 '4's. '8' doesn't appear in hundreds place because 800 is beyond 488, so 0.\n\nAdding up:\n\n'4's: 49 +50 +89 = 188\n'8's:49 +48 +0 =97\n\nDifference: 188 -97 =91.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So the answer should be 91 more '4's than '8's.\n\nBut let me think again: is there any chance I overcounted in the hundreds place? Because from 400 to 488, each page has a hundreds digit of '4', so that's 89 pages, each contributing one '4' in the hundreds place. So 89 '4's there. That seems right.\n\nIn the tens place, I considered 401-488, which is 88 pages. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So '4' in tens place occurs in 441-450, which is 10 pages. '8' in tens place occurs in 481-488, which is 8 pages. So that adds correctly.\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each contributing one '4' and one '8', so 48 each. Then, the last 8 pages, units digits 1-8, so one '4' and one '8'. So units total correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct. The difference is 91 more '4's than '8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting how many more '4's appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to '8's.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each set of 10 pages contributes one '4' and one '8'.\n   - 48 full sets (480 pages) contribute 48 '4's and 48 '8's.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one '4' and one '8'.\n   - Total '4's: 49, '8's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each 100 pages contribute 10 '4's and 10 '8's.\n   - 4 full hundreds (400 pages) contribute 40 '4's and 40 '8's.\n   - Remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n     - '4' appears in 441-450 (10 '4's).\n     - '8' appears in 481-488 (8 '8's).\n   - Total '4's: 50, '8's: 48.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - '4' appears in 400-488 (89 '4's).\n   - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total '4's: 89, '8's: 0.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - '8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n   - Difference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{91}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I know that each page number is printed once, starting from 1 and going up to 488. So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the positions where the digits can appear: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Since 488 is a three-digit number, I'll have to check each digit position separately for both 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles through 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for 8. But wait, I need to check how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488 pages.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position separately.\n\nLet me structure this:\n\n1. Count the number of 4's in the units place.\n2. Count the number of 4's in the tens place.\n3. Count the number of 4's in the hundreds place.\n4. Do the same for 8's.\n5. Subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's.\n\nOkay, let's start with the units place for both digits.\n\n**Units Place:**\n\nFor the units digit, every 10 numbers will have exactly one 4 and one 8. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488).\n\nIn each complete group of 10, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 groups, that's 48 4's and 48 8's.\n\nNow, the last 8 numbers (481-488): The units digits here are 1 through 8. So, in these, the digit 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, adding these, the units place contributes 48 + 1 = 49 4's and 48 + 1 = 49 8's.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. Hmm, but let me check that again.\n\nWait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, the last partial decade is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. The units digits here are 1-8, so 4 is present once (484) and 8 is present once (488). So, yes, units place has 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\n**Tens Place:**\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 times, and 8 in 80-89, also 10 times.\n\nSo, for each hundred, the tens digit contributes 10 4's and 10 8's.\n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, we have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit contributes 10 4's and 10 8's. So, 4 hundreds would contribute 4*10 = 40 4's and 4*10 = 40 8's.\n\nNow, let's check the remaining 88 pages (401-488). The tens digit in this range is from 0 (401-410, tens digit 0) up to 8 (481-488, tens digit 8).\n\nWait, actually, 401-488 is 88 numbers. Let me break this down by tens:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 481-488, but only 8 numbers, not 10.\n\nWait, but when considering the tens digit, each full ten contributes one digit to the tens place. So, for the tens digit, in the range 401-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place, and how many times does 8 appear?\n\nLooking at the breakdown:\n\n- Tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 numbers: 441, 442, ..., 450. So, that's 10 times.\n- Tens digit 8 occurs in 481-490, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times here.\n\nWait, but 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for each of these, so 8 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place for the last 88 pages (401-488), the digit 4 appears 10 times (in 441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (in 481-488).\n\nTherefore, total in the tens place:\n\n- 4's: 40 (from the complete hundreds) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50\n- 8's: 40 (from the complete hundreds) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48\n\nWait, so in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 48 times.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Because in each complete hundred, 4's and 8's each contribute 10 times in the tens place, so 4 hundreds give 40 each. Then, in the remaining 88 pages, 441-450 adds 10 more 4's, and 481-488 adds 8 more 8's.\n\nSo, yes, tens place gives 50 4's and 48 8's.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488.\n\nWait, so the hundreds digit is 4 in pages 300-399 and 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place?\n\nFrom 300-399, that's 100 numbers, so 100 times.\n\nFrom 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89), so 89 times.\n\nWait, no, 400-488 is 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in the hundreds place: 100 + 89 = 189.\n\nWait, but wait, 300-399 is 100 numbers, so hundreds digit is 3, not 4. Wait, no, 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, so 4 doesn't appear here. Wait, I think I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, so 4 doesn't appear here. Then, 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 numbers.\n\nSo, total 4's in the hundreds place: 89.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in the hundreds place: since 800-899 would be required, but the book only goes up to 488, so hundreds digit 8 never appears. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nWait, that makes sense because 488 is less than 800, so the hundreds digit can't be 8. So, 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place here.\n\nSo, hundreds place contributes 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\n**Now, let me summarize the counts for each digit place:**\n\n- **Units place:**\n  - 4's: 49\n  - 8's: 49\n\n- **Tens place:**\n  - 4's: 50\n  - 8's: 48\n\n- **Hundreds place:**\n  - 4's: 89\n  - 8's: 0\n\nNow, let's add up all the 4's and 8's.\n\nTotal 4's = Units + Tens + Hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's compute:\n\n49 + 50 = 99\n\n99 + 89 = 188\n\nSo, total 4's: 188\n\nTotal 8's = Units + Tens + Hundreds = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nSo, 4's: 188, 8's: 97\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFrom 1-488, how many 4's and 8's in units place.\n\nEach 10 numbers contribute one 4 and one 8. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach 100 numbers contribute 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would contribute 40 each. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 times. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50, 8's:40+8=48. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. 8 doesn't appear in hundreds place because the book ends at 488. So, 0 8's. That seems correct.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so hundreds digit is 4 in each of those, so 89 4's. That's correct.\n\nWait, another way to check: let's calculate total digits printed.\n\nBut maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, let me check the counts again.\n\nUnits place:\n\n48 full decades: 48 4's and 48 8's.\n\nRemaining 8 numbers: 481-488, units digits 1-8, so 4 and 8 each once. So, 49 each.\n\nTens place:\n\n4 hundreds: 40 4's and 40 8's.\n\nRemaining 88 pages: 441-450 (10 4's in tens place) and 481-488 (8 8's in tens place). So, 50 4's and 48 8's.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n400-488: 89 4's, 0 8's.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each 10 numbers contribute one 4 and one 8.\n   - 488 / 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 full decades, contributing 48 each.\n   - Remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - Total: 49 4's, 49 8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each 100 numbers contribute 10 4's and 10 8's.\n   - 4 hundreds contribute 40 each.\n   - Remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n     - 441-450: 10 4's.\n     - 481-488: 8 8's.\n   - Total: 50 4's, 48 8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 400-488: 89 4's.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 4's, 0 8's.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 97 = 91\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488, and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. That sounds like a plan.\n\nLet me start by considering how digits are structured in page numbers. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488, which is a three-digit number. So, I'll have to consider units, tens, and hundreds places separately for both 4 and 8.\n\nI remember that when counting digits, it's helpful to look at each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) individually and calculate how many times each digit appears in each place. Then, I can sum them up for the total count.\n\nLet's start with the digit 4. I'll need to count how many 4's appear in the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Since the book has 488 pages, there are 488 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete groups of 10, which is 488 divided by 10, but we take the floor of that because we can't have a fraction of a group.\n   - So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, but taking the floor gives 48. However, wait, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10, so the number of 4's in the units place is actually 48 times 1 (since each group contributes one 4), but we also need to check if the last group (481-488) has a 4 in the units place. 484 is within this range, so that's one more. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, no, actually, let me correct that. The formula is usually floor((n + 1) / 10) for the number of times a digit appears in the units place. But maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, for each digit place, the count is calculated as follows:\n\nFor units place:\n- The number of times 4 appears is equal to the number of complete tens in 488, which is 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 times, but since 488 is the last page, and 484 is included, that's 49 times. Wait, no, because 488 \u00f7 10 is 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place, but the last group from 481-488 includes 484, so that's the 49th occurrence. So yes, 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Similarly, for the tens place, the digit 4 appears in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n   - How many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see:\n     - First block: 40-49 (10 numbers)\n     - Second: 140-149 (10)\n     - Third: 240-249 (10)\n     - Fourth: 340-349 (10)\n     - Fifth: 440-449 (10)\n   - Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 5\u00d710=50.\n   - But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, all 10 are included.\n   - So, tens place 4's: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Now, for the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears from page 400 to 488.\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, inclusive.\n   - How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.\n   - So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 4's.\n\nNow, adding them up:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. For the units place, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48\u00d71=48, plus the last group (481-488) has 484, which is one more, so 49. That seems right.\n\nFor the tens place, each block of 100 has 10 4's in the tens place. From 0-488, there are 5 such blocks: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, but the last block is only up to 488, so does that affect the count? Let me see: in the hundreds place, from 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8, so the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 4's. So, yes, the tens place 4's are 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5\u00d710=50. That seems correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. So total 4's: 49 + 50 +89=188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, for each group of 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - From 1 to 488, the number of complete groups of 10 is 488 \u00f710=48.8, so 48 full groups, contributing 48 8's, and the last group (481-488) includes 488, which is an 8 in the units place. So, total units place 8's: 48 +1=49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - For the tens place, 8 appears in blocks of 100, specifically in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.\n   - Wait, but our book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so 9 numbers.\n   - Let me check: each block of 100 contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except the last block if it's incomplete.\n   - So, from 0-488, how many complete blocks of 100 are there? 4 blocks: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and then 400-488.\n   - Wait, no, 0-99 is the first, then 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, the first four blocks (0-399) each have a full 10 8's in the tens place, and the last block (400-488) has 480-488, which is 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place.\n   - So, for the tens place:\n     - First four blocks: 4\u00d710=40\n     - Last block: 9\n     - Total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, let me make sure. From 0-99: 80-89: 10 8's\n100-199: 180-189:10\n200-299:280-289:10\n300-399:380-389:10\n400-488:480-488:9\nSo total tens place 8's:10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n   - So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding them up:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal 8's=49+49+0=98.\n\nWait, let me check the tens place again. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so that's 9 8's in the tens place. So, yes, 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, totaling 49.\n\nSo, total 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from the total 4's:188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal=49+50+89=188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal=49+49=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting.\n\nWait, for the tens place of 4's, I considered 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each contributes 10, so 5\u00d710=50. That's correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place of 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. Correct.\n\nFor 8's, units place:49, tens place:49, so 98 total.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the units place for 4's. Let me recount that.\n\nUnits place for 4's: every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. From 1 to 488, how many 4's in units place?\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10 is 488 \u00f710=48.8, so 48 groups, each contributing one 4, so 48\u00d71=48. Then, the last group is 481-488, which includes 484, so that's one more 4. So total units 4's:48+1=49. That seems right.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: same calculation, 48 full groups (48\u00d71=48) plus 488, which is one more, so 49. Correct.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should consider how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. That means the page numbers can be 1-digit (1-9), 2-digit (10-99), or 3-digit (100-488). \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears, and then find the difference between these two counts.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\n1. **Units place for 4's:**\n   - For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484.\n   - Since the book has 488 pages, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete sets of 10 within 488. That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, let me check that. Actually, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 occur in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're dealing with whole numbers, it's 48 times. But wait, does 488 include 484? Let me see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place for 4's:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Let's count how many such sets there are. From 1 to 488, we have 4 complete sets of 100 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages in 401-488.\n   - In each set of 100, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, 4 sets would give 4 * 10 = 40 occurrences.\n   - Now, in the last partial set (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's another 10 occurrences.\n   - So, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place for 4's:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. For the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's. For the tens place, 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10, totaling 50. For the units place, every 10 numbers, so 48 times. Yes, 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place for 8's:**\n   - Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, the units digit is 8 once. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n   - 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so the last 8 in the units place is at 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me check: numbers ending with 8 are 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms? It's an arithmetic sequence where a1=8, d=10, last term=488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place for 8's:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488).\n   - So, let's count how many full sets of 100 we have. From 1-488, we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and 88 pages in 401-488.\n   - In each full hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89). So, 4 sets give 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - Now, in the last partial set (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, 9 occurrences.\n   - Total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place for 8's:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the numbers 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n   - So, 0 occurrences.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. Units place: 49 times. Tens place: 49 times. Hundreds place: 0. So, total 98 times.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should understand how page numbers are structured. Each page has a number from 1 to 488, and each digit in these numbers can be a 4 or an 8. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears and how many times 8 appears, then subtract the two counts to find the difference.\n\nI remember that when dealing with digit counting problems, it's helpful to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds, etc. So, I'll probably need to analyze each place value from 1 to 488.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for 8. So, in the units place, from 1 to 488, how many 4's and 8's are there?\n\nWait, but 488 is not a multiple of 10, so I should calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are and then check the remaining pages.\n\nThe total number of pages is 488. So, the number of complete tens is 48 (since 48 * 10 = 480), and then there are 8 more pages (481 to 488). \n\nIn each complete group of 10, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 complete groups, that's 48 4's and 48 8's in the units place. Now, for the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1 through 8. So, in this partial group, the units digit 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488). \n\nSo, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\nTotal units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\nSo, in the units place, 4's and 8's are equal, each appearing 49 times.\n\nNext, let's move to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each cycle of 100 has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49 (10 numbers), and 8 in 80-89 (10 numbers). \n\nBut since we're dealing up to 488, which is 4 hundreds, I need to consider each hundred separately.\n\nWait, but 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, let's break it down:\n\n1. Pages 1-99: This is the first hundred. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (40-49), and 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n\n2. Pages 100-199: The tens digit here is 0-9 again, so same as above: 10 4's (140-149) and 10 8's (180-189).\n\n3. Pages 200-299: Similarly, 10 4's (240-249) and 10 8's (280-289).\n\n4. Pages 300-399: Again, 10 4's (340-349) and 10 8's (380-389).\n\n5. Pages 400-488: Now, this is the last partial hundred. The tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, let's see:\n\n   - The tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages.\n   - The tens digit 8 appears in 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 pages because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here.\n\nSo, for each hundred except the last, we have 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. The last hundred (400-488) has 10 4's and 9 8's.\n\nNow, let's count:\n\nNumber of hundreds with full tens cycles: 4 (1-399), so 4 * 10 = 40 4's and 40 8's.\n\nIn the last partial hundred (400-488):\n\n- 4's in tens place: 10 (440-449)\n- 8's in tens place: 9 (480-488)\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\nTotal tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 49 times. That's a difference of 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this book. So, let's see when 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\n- Pages 400-488: The hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages. So, how many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nFor 8's in the hundreds place, we need to check if any page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place. But since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the hundreds place contributes 0 8's.\n\nSo, hundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nSo, 4's have 89 more in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each place.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n- 4's: 49\n- 8's: 49\n\nTens place:\n\n- 4's: 50\n- 8's: 49\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nNow, adding all these up:\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nWait, that can't be right because 188 - 98 = 90, which seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, in the tens place, I thought the last partial hundred (400-488) had 10 4's and 9 8's. So, for 4's in tens place, it's 40 (from the first 4 hundreds) + 10 = 50. For 8's, it's 40 (from the first 4 hundreds) + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4's are 89 times, and 8's are 0. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188, and 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me think again.\n\nThe hundreds digit is 4 only in pages 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nBut for 8's in the hundreds place, since the book only goes up to 488, there are no pages where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me verify with a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nWell, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, total number of times is floor(488 / 10) = 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 4 appears once (484). So, total units 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: same logic, 48 full groups (48 8's) and in the remaining 8 numbers, 8 appears once (488). So, 48 +1 =49.\n\nNow, tens place:\n\nHow many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nEach hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, for each hundred, 10 times. There are 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), so 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nBut in the last hundred (400-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 40 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place:\n\nEach hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 10 per hundred. For the first three hundreds (0-399), that's 3 * 10=30. In the last hundred (400-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total 30 +9=39.\n\nWait, wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. Earlier, I thought it was 40 +9=49, but now I'm getting 39. Hmm, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the hundreds. Let's see:\n\nFrom 1-99: 10 8's in the tens place (80-89)\n100-199: 10 (180-189)\n200-299: 10 (280-289)\n300-399: 10 (380-389)\n400-488: 9 (480-488)\n\nSo, that's 10 +10 +10 +10 +9=49? Wait, but 1-99 is one hundred, 100-199 is the second, 200-299 is third, 300-399 is fourth, and 400-488 is the fifth, but it's a partial hundred. So, actually, in the first four hundreds (up to 399), each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, it's 9. So, total 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, so earlier I was correct with 49. But when I broke it down into 1-99, etc., I thought it was 10+10+10+10+9=49, which matches. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 40 (from first four hundreds) plus 9, so 49. So, that's correct. So, in the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 49, so 4's have one more.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\n4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\n8's in the hundreds place: since the book only goes up to 488, there are no pages where the hundreds digit is 8, so 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 188\n\nTotal 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, so that's the calculation. But let me check if I did the hundreds place correctly.\n\nWait, from 400-488, that's 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these 89 pages, so 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nAnd since the book ends at 488, there's no 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again: 488 is the last page, so the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is indeed 89 pages (488 - 400 +1 =89).\n\nSo, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n\n8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again: 90 seems a bit high. Let me check with a smaller example to see if my method is correct.\n\nSuppose we have a book with 28 pages. How many 4's and 8's?\n\nUnits place:\n\n4's: 2 (4,14,24) but wait, 28 pages, so units 4's: 4,14,24 \u2192 3 times\nUnits 8's:8,18,28 \u21923 times\n\nTens place:\n\n4's: 40-49, but since it's only 28 pages, 40-49 doesn't exist. So, tens 4's: none\nTens 8's: 80-89, which also doesn't exist. So, tens 8's: none\n\nHundreds place: none, since it's a 28-page book.\n\nSo, total 4's:3, 8's:3, difference 0.\n\nWait, but according to my method, units place:\n\nUnits 4's: floor(28/10)=2, plus if 28 >= (2*10 +4)=24, so 28-24=4, so 2 +1=3\nUnits 8's: floor(28/10)=2, plus if 28 >= (2*10 +8)=28, so 2 +1=3\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4's: each hundred contributes 10, but since 28 <100, it's 0\nSame for 8's:0\n\nSo, total 4's:3, 8's:3, difference 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test: 84 pages.\n\nUnits place:\n\n4's: floor(84/10)=8, plus if 84 >= (8*10 +4)=84, so 8 +1=9\n8's: floor(84/10)=8, plus if 84 >= (8*10 +8)=88, but 84 <88, so 8\n\nSo, units 4's:9, units 8's:8\n\nTens place:\n\n4's: from 40-49, which is 10 pages, so 10\n8's: from 80-84, which is 5 pages (80-84)\n\nHundreds place: 0\n\nTotal 4's:9+10=19\nTotal 8's:8+5=13\nDifference:6\n\nWait, let's count manually:\n\nNumbers from 1-84.\n\n4's in units:4,14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84 \u21929 times\n8's in units:8,18,28,38,48,58,68,78 \u21928 times\n\n4's in tens:40-49:10 numbers\n8's in tens:80-84:5 numbers\n\nSo, total 4's:9+10=19\nTotal 8's:8+5=13\nDifference:6, which matches my method.\n\nSo, the method seems correct.\n\nTherefore, returning to the original problem, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I feel 90 is a lot. Let me think again.\n\nWait, 4's in hundreds place:89, which is a big chunk. So, 89 4's just from the hundreds place, and 8's have none there. So, that's a big difference.\n\nBut let's see:\n\nTotal 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98\n\nDifference:90\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference between their counts.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place Analysis:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers in the units place.\n   - Total complete groups of 10 in 488 pages: 48 groups (480 pages).\n   - Each group contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488) include 484 (one 4) and 488 (one 8).\n   - **Total Units Place:**\n     - 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n     - 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place Analysis:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers.\n   - For each complete hundred (e.g., 1-99, 100-199), 10 4's and 10 8's appear in the tens place.\n   - There are four complete hundreds (1-399), contributing 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - The last partial hundred (400-488):\n     - 4's: 10 (440-449)\n     - 8's: 9 (480-488)\n   - **Total Tens Place:**\n     - 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n     - 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place Analysis:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, contributing 89 4's.\n   - No page has an 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total Hundreds Place:**\n     - 4's: 89\n     - 8's: 0\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 90 more times than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should understand what exactly the problem is asking. It says each page number is printed once, starting from 1 and ending at 488. So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nAlright, so maybe I should start by counting the number of 4's in each digit place separately\u2014like units place, tens place, hundreds place\u2014and then do the same for 8's. That makes sense because digits can appear in different places, and counting them separately should make it easier.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4. I'll consider each place value one by one.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** \n   - The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, it's 4; from 11-20, it's 14; and so on.\n   - So, to find out how many times 4 appears in the units place up to 488, I can divide 488 by 10. That gives me 48 full blocks of 10 and a remainder of 8. Each block contributes one 4, so that's 48 times. But wait, the last partial block is 481-488, and in this, the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - So, how many full hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds. Each of these contributes 10 instances of 4 in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - Now, the last partial hundred is 400-488. In this, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, adding that, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 instances.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's printed are 188.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units place: 48 full tens (each contributing 1) and then one more in 484, so 49. Tens place: 4 full hundreds (each contributing 10) and then 10 more in 440-449, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4, the units digit cycles every 10. So, in every block of 10, 8 appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48. The last partial block is 481-488, which includes 488, so that's one more 8 in the units place. So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit is 8 in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block of 100 contributes 10 such numbers.\n   - How many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - Now, the last partial hundred is 400-488. In this, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since our book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 instances of 8 in the tens place.\n   - Wait, no, actually, 480-489 is a full set, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, adding that, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check the tens place. From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10, so 4*10=40. Then from 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 8's are 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in 481-488, the units digit 4 is at 484, so that's one more, total 49. That seems right.\n\n- Tens place: 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 full hundreds. Each contributes 10, so 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Yep.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\n- Units place: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in 481-488, the units digit 8 is at 488, so that's one more, total 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: None, since 488 < 800. So, 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. In the last partial hundred, 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 4's in the tens place, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 is from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 more.\n\nWait, but when I calculated the hundreds place for 4's, I included all numbers from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, that's correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked each part, and it seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n\n   - **Units Place (1s place):**\n     - Every block of 10 numbers contributes one '4' in the units place.\n     - Total blocks of 10 in 488: 48 full blocks (480 numbers) + 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n     - Each full block has 1 '4', so 48 * 1 = 48.\n     - In the extra block (481-488), '4' appears once (484).\n     - Total units place '4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n   - **Tens Place (10s place):**\n     - Every block of 100 numbers contributes 10 '4's in the tens place (e.g., 40-49).\n     - Total blocks of 100 in 488: 4 full blocks (400 numbers) + 88 extra numbers (401-488).\n     - Each full block contributes 10 '4's, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n     - In the extra block (400-488), the tens place '4' appears from 440-449, which is 10 numbers.\n     - Total tens place '4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place (100s place):**\n     - The hundreds digit is '4' from page 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1).\n     - Total hundreds place '4's: 89.\n\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n\n   - **Units Place (1s place):**\n     - Similar to '4', every block of 10 contributes one '8'.\n     - Total units place '8's: 48 (from 48 full blocks) + 1 (488) = 49.\n\n   - **Tens Place (10s place):**\n     - Every block of 100 contributes 10 '8's.\n     - Total tens place '8's from full blocks: 4 * 10 = 40.\n     - In the extra block (400-488), '8' appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n     - Total tens place '8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place (100s place):**\n     - No pages have '8' in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n     - Total hundreds place '8's: 0.\n\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I know that each page is numbered from 1 to 488, and each number is printed once. So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by considering how digits are structured in numbers. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488, which is a three-digit number. So, I should analyze the occurrence of the digits 4 and 8 in each position: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nI think the best approach is to count the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each digit place separately and then sum them up.\n\nLet's start with the digit 4.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, etc.\n   - Since there are 488 pages, the total number of blocks of 10 is 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8). But wait, actually, it's 48 full blocks and a partial block of 8 pages (from 481 to 488).\n   - So, in each full block of 10, there's one 4 in the units place. Therefore, for 48 blocks, that's 48 \u00d7 1 = 48 occurrences.\n   - Now, check the partial block from 481 to 488. The units digits here are 1 through 8. The digit 4 appears once in this partial block (at 484). So, that's 1 more.\n   - Total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - How many full blocks of 100 are there in 488? Well, 488 \u00f7 100 = 4.88, so there are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block from 401-488.\n   - In each full block, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 occurrences.\n   - Now, the partial block from 401-488: the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The tens digit is 4 for the numbers 440-449. That's another 10 occurrences.\n   - Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, right? Yes, because 449 is less than 488.\n   - So, in the partial block, we have another 10 occurrences.\n   - But wait, does 440-449 fall entirely within 401-488? Yes, because 440 is greater than 401, and 449 is less than 488. So, that's 10 more.\n   - So, total 4's in tens place: 40 (from full blocks) + 10 (from partial block) = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit cycles every 1000 numbers, but since our book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n   - For the hundreds place to be 4, the numbers would be from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences.\n   - Wait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first number with 4 in the hundreds place, and 488 is the last. So, from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's indeed 89 numbers.\n   - So, total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 occurrences of the digit 4.\n\nWait, let me double-check that because 89 in the hundreds place seems high. Let me recount the hundreds place.\n\nWait, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 is correct. So, 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nNow, moving on to counting the number of 8's.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to the 4's, in the units place, 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - There are 48 full blocks of 10 in 488 pages, so 48 \u00d7 1 = 48 occurrences.\n   - The partial block from 481 to 488 has units digits 1-8, so 8 appears once at 488.\n   - So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In the tens place, 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each full block of 100 has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n   - There are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Now, the partial block from 401-488: the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but 480 is included, right?\n   - Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. But wait, 480 is included, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8.\n   - Wait, but 480 is in the range 401-488, so yes, it's included. So, that's 9 occurrences.\n   - So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only when the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8.\n   - Therefore, 0 occurrences.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, that seems off because 49 + 49 = 98, but let me check again.\n\nWait, in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 occurrences. So, 40 (from full blocks) + 9 = 49. So, units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0, total 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, for 4's, I had 188, and for 8's, 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in the partial blocks.\n\nLet me verify the units place for 4's: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once at 484. So, total 49. That seems correct.\n\nFor tens place of 4's: each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so 4 blocks \u00d710 =40. Then, in the last partial block (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40+10=50. That seems correct.\n\nFor hundreds place of 4's: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\nUnits place: same logic, 48 full blocks, 48 occurrences, plus the last partial block (481-488) has 8 at 488, so 49 total. Correct.\n\nTens place: each block of 100 has 10 occurrences, so 4 blocks \u00d710=40. Then, in the partial block (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488. So, 0.\n\nSo, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nTherefore, 4's:188, 8's:98. The difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers is that?\n\n488 - 400 +1 =89. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 4's again. From 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place for 8's again. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 \u00f710=48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, the last partial block is 481-488, which has units digits 1-8, so 8 appears once at 488. So, 48+1=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place of 8's, each block of 100 has 10 occurrences, so 4 blocks \u00d710=40. Then, in the partial block (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, 4's:188, 8's:98, difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in the hundreds place for 4's? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 is correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the tens place for 8's. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 occurrences. So, 40+9=49.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, maybe I should list out the counts again.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50=99; 99+89=188.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I should understand the problem clearly. The book has pages numbered from 1 to 488, and each page number is printed once. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nAlright, so maybe I should start by considering how digits are structured in page numbers. Page numbers can be 1-digit, 2-digit, or 3-digit numbers. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to three digits, specifically up to 488. So, I should consider units, tens, and hundreds places separately for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nLet me tackle the digit 4 first. I'll need to count how many times 4 appears in the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nStarting with the units place: In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, it's page 4; from 11-20, it's page 14; and so on. So, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten and then 8 extra pages. So, in each of these 48 sets, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit cycles from 1 to 8, so the digit 4 appears once more in page 484. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for a block of ten numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: The first block is 40-49, which is 10 pages. Then, the next block would be 140-149, another 10 pages, and so on. \n\nWait, actually, in the hundreds place, since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. But for the tens place, when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can go up to 8. So, let me think. \n\nFor the tens digit being 4, the numbers would be from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there? Let's see:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nSo that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, the tens place contributes 50 times the digit 4.\n\nWait, but wait a second, when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit goes up to 8, so 440-449 is indeed within 488. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in each of these, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 occurrences.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the digit 8. I'll do the same process.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4, in every set of ten numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-10, it's page 8; 11-20, page 18; etc. So, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488? 488/10=48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) include page 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, units place 8's: 48 +1=49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's check each block:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 occurrences, and the last block contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=40+9=49.\n\nWait, but let me think again. For the hundreds digit, when it's 4, the tens digit goes up to 8, so 480-489 would be the next block, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds =49 +49 +0=98.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, 49+49=98. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal:49+49=98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly for 4's? The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nFor the tens place of 4's, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 48 full decades, each contributing one, plus the last partial decade (481-488) which includes 484, so one more, totaling 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, units place:49, tens place:49 (including the 9 in 480-488). So, 98 total. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** In each set of 10 numbers, '4' appears once. There are 48 full sets (480 pages) and 8 extra pages (481-488). So, 48 + 1 = 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** '4' appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 5 blocks. Each contributes 10, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** '4' appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to '4', 48 full sets and 1 extra, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens place:** '8' appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488 (9 numbers). So, 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No page numbers here since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should understand how page numbers are structured. Each page number is a number from 1 to 488, and each digit in these numbers can be a 4 or an 8. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll go through each place and calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in each.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every block of 10 consecutive numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. \n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each complete block, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So for 48 blocks, that's 48 times for each digit. Now, looking at the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 8 appears once here, but 4 doesn't appear because the units digits go up only to 8. \n\nSo, units place total:\n- 4's: 48 times\n- 8's: 48 (from blocks) + 1 (from the extra numbers) = 49 times\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Each block of 10 gives one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 blocks give 48 4's and 48 8's. Then, the last partial block is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. The units digits here are 1 through 8, so 8 appears once, and 4 doesn't appear. So, units place:\n- 4's: 48\n- 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\nOkay, that seems correct.\n\nNext, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, in each block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (like 40-49), and the same for 8 (like 80-89). \n\nNow, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 numbers (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10=40 4's and 40 8's in the tens place. \n\nNow, the remaining 88 numbers are from 401-488. Let's look at the tens digit here. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 as we go through 401-410, 411-420, etc., up to 480-488. \n\nWait, let me think. From 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-488). So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears exactly 10 times except for the last one, which is 8, but only 9 times because we stop at 488. Wait, no, actually, 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8, but the units digits go from 1 to 8, so the tens digit 8 appears 8 times? Hmm, maybe I'm complicating it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider how many times each tens digit appears in 401-488. The tens digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 401-488, how many complete tens blocks are there?\n\nWait, 401-488 is 88 numbers. So, 88 divided by 10 is 8.8, meaning 8 complete blocks and 8 extra numbers. Each complete block contributes one occurrence of each tens digit. So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, they appear 8 times in the tens place. Wait, but that might not be accurate because from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490), but since we only go up to 488, the last block is incomplete.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate how many times each tens digit appears in 401-488. Let me list the ranges:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0\n- 411-420: tens digit 1\n- 421-430: tens digit 2\n- 431-440: tens digit 3\n- 441-450: tens digit 4\n- 451-460: tens digit 5\n- 461-470: tens digit 6\n- 471-480: tens digit 7\n- 481-488: tens digit 8\n\nSo, each of these ranges is 10 numbers except the last one, which is 8 numbers. So, the tens digits 0 through 7 each appear 10 times in their respective ranges, and the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in 481-488.\n\nWait, but 401-410 is 10 numbers, so tens digit 0 appears 10 times. Similarly, 411-420 is 10 numbers, so tens digit 1 appears 10 times, and so on up to 471-480, which is 10 numbers, so tens digit 7 appears 10 times. Then, 481-488 is 8 numbers, so tens digit 8 appears 8 times.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place from 401-488:\n- Tens digit 4: 10 times (from 441-450)\n- Tens digit 8: 8 times (from 481-488)\n\nSo, adding to the previous 400 numbers:\n- 4's in tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50\n- 8's in tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 8 (from 401-488) = 48\n\nWait, that seems off because earlier I thought the 4's in the tens place would be 40 from 1-400, and then 10 more from 401-488, making 50. Similarly, 8's would be 40 from 1-400 plus 8 from 401-488, totaling 48.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 hundreds would be 4*10=40 each. Then, from 401-488, as I broke down, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case because the book has 488 pages. So, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. \n\nLet me think: from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's 0. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1. From 200-299, it's 2. From 300-399, it's 3. From 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, how many times does each hundreds digit appear?\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 100-199, which is 100 numbers, so 100 times.\n- Hundreds digit 2: 200-299, 100 times.\n- Hundreds digit 3: 300-399, 100 times.\n- Hundreds digit 4: 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\nWait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nNow, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? It's 89 times. How about 8? Well, the hundreds digit can't be 8 because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the hundreds digit 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, hundreds place:\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\nNow for 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me check my calculations again because I think I might have made a mistake in the units place for 8's.\n\nEarlier, I thought that in the units place, for each block of 10, 8 appears once, and in the last partial block (481-488), 8 appears once in the units place. So, units place for 8's would be 48 (from blocks) + 1 (from the last 8 numbers) = 49. That seems correct.\n\nFor the tens place, I had 40 from 1-400 and 8 from 401-488, totaling 48 for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place, 8's don't appear at all, so 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nNow, total 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check each digit place again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place:\n- Each block of 10 contributes 1 four and 1 eight.\n- 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1 four and 1 eight.\n- So, 48 fours and 48 eights.\n- The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 8 appears once, and 4 doesn't appear.\n- So, units place: 48 fours, 49 eights.\n\nTens place:\n- Each block of 100 contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place.\n- 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 full blocks (1-400), each contributing 10 fours and 10 eights.\n- So, 4*10=40 fours and 40 eights.\n- Now, the remaining 88 numbers (401-488) contribute:\n  - From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8.\n  - Each tens digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times (e.g., 401-410: tens 0, 411-420: tens 1, etc.), and the last block 481-488 has tens digit 8 for 8 numbers.\n  - So, for 4's in tens place: 441-450 is 10 numbers, so 10 fours.\n  - For 8's in tens place: 481-488 is 8 numbers, so 8 eights.\n- So, tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 fours, 40 + 8 = 48 eights.\n\nHundreds place:\n- From 1-99: hundreds digit 0, so no fours or eights.\n- From 100-199: hundreds digit 1, no fours or eights.\n- From 200-299: hundreds digit 2, same.\n- From 300-399: hundreds digit 3, same.\n- From 400-488: hundreds digit 4, which is 89 numbers (400-488 inclusive), so 89 fours.\n- No hundreds digit 8, so 0 eights.\n\nAdding up:\n- Fours: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187\n- Eights: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 187 - 97 = 90\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because 90 seems like a lot. Let me check if I counted correctly in each place.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position separately.\n\nFor units place:\n- The number of 4's: floor(488/10) = 48, plus if the last digit is >=4, add 1. Since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so 48 + 1 = 49? Wait, no, that's for counting numbers up to N where the digit is >=4. Wait, no, actually, in the units place, each digit 0-9 appears equally in each block of 10, except possibly the last partial block.\n\nWait, perhaps a better formula is:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N is:\n- Complete blocks: (N // 10) * 1\n- Plus, if the last digit is >= d, add 1 if d !=0, else add (last digit +1)\n\nWait, no, maybe it's better to think as:\nFor units digit, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly N//10 times, and if the last partial block has more than d, add 1.\n\nWait, but let's take N=488.\n\nNumber of 4's in units place:\n- Complete blocks: 488 // 10 = 48, each contributing 1 four.\n- Last partial block: 488 % 10 = 8. Since 8 >=4, add 1.\n- So total 4's: 48 +1=49\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's in units place were 48. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let's recast this. For units digit 4:\n\nEach 10 numbers contribute 1 four in the units place. So, from 1-480, that's 48 fours. Then, from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 doesn't appear. So, total 4's in units place: 48.\n\nSimilarly, for units digit 8:\n\nFrom 1-480, that's 48 eights. From 481-488, the units digit 8 appears once (at 488). So, total 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, so according to this, units place:\n- 4's:48\n- 8's:49\n\nWhich is what I had earlier.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's in tens place: Each 100 numbers contribute 10 fours in the tens place. So, from 1-400, that's 4*10=40 fours. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So total 40 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place: From 1-400, 4*10=40 eights. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, that's 8 numbers (481-488), so 8 eights. So, total 40 +8=48.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nNumber of 8's: None, as hundreds digit doesn't reach 8.\n\nSo, total counts:\n- 4's: 48 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)= 187\n- 8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=97\n\nDifference:187-97=90\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that for units digit 4, it's 48, but using the formula, it's 48 +1=49? Wait, no, in the formula, if N=488, the units digit 4 appears 48 times because the last partial block (481-488) doesn't include a 4 in the units place. So, the formula should be:\n\nNumber of 4's in units place = (488 //10) + (1 if (488 %10 >=4) else 0) but since 488%10=8, which is >=4, so 48 +1=49? But wait, that would be if we were counting numbers up to 488 where units digit is 4, which would be 4,14,24,...,484, which is 48 times because 484 is the 48th occurrence. Wait, 484 is the 48th 4 in the units place. Then, 494 would be the 49th, but 494 >488, so it doesn't exist. So, the number of 4's in units place is 48.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place, it's 48 (from 8,18,...,488), which is 49 because 488 is included. So, 49 eights.\n\nSo, units place:\n- 4's:48\n- 8's:49\n\nTens place:\n- 4's:50\n- 8's:48\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's:89\n- 8's:0\n\nTotal:\n- 4's:48+50+89=187\n- 8's:49+48+0=97\n\nDifference:187-97=90\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first thought about it, I thought the difference might be 90, but I wanted to make sure I wasn't overcounting somewhere.\n\nLet me try another approach: calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\n- Units place: For each 10 numbers, 1 four. 488//10=48, so 48 fours. Now, check if the last number (488) has a units digit >=4. 8>=4, so add 1 if 4 is in the units place, but 488's units digit is 8, so no, so 48 fours.\n\nWait, but wait, 488//10=48, and 488%10=8, which is >=4, so if we're counting up to 488, the number of 4's in units place is 48 +1 if 4 <=8. But since 4 <=8, do we add 1? Wait, no, because the 48th occurrence is at 484, and 494 is beyond 488, so we don't add anything. So, 48 fours.\n\n- Tens place: For each 100 numbers, 10 fours in tens place. 488//100=4, so 4*10=40. Now, check the remaining 88 numbers (401-488). In these, how many tens digits are 4? From 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So, total tens place fours:40+10=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nTotal 4's:48+50+89=187\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\n- Units place: For each 10 numbers, 1 eight. 488//10=48, so 48 eights. Now, check if the last number's units digit is >=8. 488%10=8, which is equal to 8, so add 1. So, 48+1=49 eights.\n\n- Tens place: For each 100 numbers, 10 eights in tens place. 488//100=4, so 4*10=40. Now, check the remaining 88 numbers (401-488). The tens digit 8 appears in 481-490, but since we stop at 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, 8 eights. So, total tens place eights:40+8=48.\n\n- Hundreds place: No eights, as before.\n\nTotal 8's:49+48=97\n\nDifference:187-97=90\n\nYes, so the difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the number of times the digits 4 and 8 appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book. By analyzing each digit place (units, tens, and hundreds), we determine the counts for each digit and then find the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - Total blocks of 10 in 488 pages: 48 complete blocks.\n   - 4's in units place: 48.\n   - 8's in units place: 48 + 1 (since 488 ends with 8) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - 4 complete hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - From 401-488:\n     - 4's: 10 times (441-450).\n     - 8's: 8 times (481-488).\n   - Total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's in tens place: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4's: From 400-488, 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n   - 8's: None, as the book doesn't reach 800 pages.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n   - 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once in each set of 10, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488.\n\nNow, to find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide the total number of pages by 10 and take the integer part. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10 pages. Each set contributes one 4, so that's 48 times. But wait, does the 488th page have a 4 in the units place? Let me check: 488 ends with an 8, so no, the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, units place for 4 is 48 times.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets. Each set has one 8, so that's 48 times. But wait, the last page is 488, which ends with an 8, so that's an extra 8 in the units place. So, does that mean 49 times for 8? Let me think: the first 48 sets go up to page 480, and then pages 481-488 add another 8 in 488. So yes, 49 times for 8 in the units place.\n\nWait, but I thought each set of 10 has one 8, so 48 sets would be 48, and then the 49th set from 481-490 would have 488 as part of it, but since we only go up to 488, the 8 in 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 4 appears 48 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in a block of 100 pages. For example, in pages 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for pages 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, it's 8 for pages 80-89, another 10 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, let's see. From 1 to 488, how many complete hundreds are there? There are four complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each of these has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40 times. Now, what about the last partial hundred, 401-488? In the tens place, the numbers go from 401 to 488. The tens digit here is 4 for pages 401-410, which is 10 pages, but wait, 401-410 would have tens digit 0, right? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 401-410: the tens digit is 0, because 401 is 4 0 1, 402 is 4 0 2, etc., up to 410, which is 4 1 0. So, the tens digit is 0 from 401-410, then 1 from 411-420, and so on. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, that's another 10 times. So, total in the tens place for 4 is 40 (from the first four hundreds) plus 10 (from 440-449) = 50 times.\n\nWait, but 488 is less than 500, so the last hundred is 401-488. So, in 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0 to 8. So, for the tens digit 4, it's from 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, yes, 10 times. So, total 40 + 10 = 50 times for 4 in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the digit 8 in the tens place. Again, in each complete hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, four complete hundreds give 4*10=40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in pages 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 pages: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 pages, right? 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, total for 8 in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 starting at 480. So, 480 is the first, then 481, up to 488. So, that's 9 pages because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, yes, 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So, 89 times for 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times for 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from the total 4's: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n- 4's: 48 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens)\n- 8's: 49 (since 488 includes 488, which is the 49th 8 in units place)\n\nTens place:\n- 4's: 50 (40 from first four hundreds, 10 from 440-449)\n- 8's: 49 (40 from first four hundreds, 9 from 480-488)\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's: 89 (from 400-488)\n- 8's: 0\n\nAdding up:\n4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **4's:** Each set of 10 pages contributes one 4. With 48 full sets (480 pages), plus page 484, totaling 48 times.\n   - **8's:** Similarly, 48 full sets plus page 488, totaling 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - **4's:** Each hundred contributes 10 times. Four full hundreds (400 instances) plus 10 from 440-449, totaling 50 times.\n   - **8's:** Four full hundreds (400 instances) plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **4's:** From 400-488, 89 times.\n   - **8's:** Never appears, so 0 times.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 187 - 98 = 89\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I need to consider all the page numbers from 1 to 488 and count how many times the digit 4 appears and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nI remember that to count digits in numbers, it's often helpful to look at each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds, and so on. Since 488 is a three-digit number, I should check each place\u2014units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the digit 4 will appear once every 10 numbers, and the same goes for the digit 8.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra numbers (from 481 to 488). \n\nSo, in the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 times 1 (for each block) plus any additional 4's in the extra numbers. Looking at 481 to 488, the units digits are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So, there's one more 4 in the units place at 484. Therefore, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, each block of 10 has one 8, so 48 times 1, plus any 8's in the extra numbers. The extra numbers go up to 488, so the units digit 8 appears once at 488. So, total 8's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, so in the units place, both 4's and 8's occur 49 times each. Hmm, that's interesting. So, the difference in the units place is zero. But I need to check other digit places too.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, in each block of 100, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, for the digit 4 in the tens place: Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Similarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an extra 88 numbers (401-488).\n\nIn each of the 4 complete blocks, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times per block, so 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, let's check the extra 88 numbers, from 401 to 488. The tens digits here go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page).\n\nSo, adding these to the previous counts: For the tens place, 4's are 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, so in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times, giving a difference of 1 more 4 than 8.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. Wait, actually, 400-488 would have the hundreds digit as 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place?\n\nFrom 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 pages. Therefore, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit can only be 8 if the number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8 in this book. Therefore, the digit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's are 89 and 8's are 0, giving a difference of 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let me summarize the counts:\n\n- Units place:\n  - 4's: 49\n  - 8's: 49\n  - Difference: 0\n\n- Tens place:\n  - 4's: 50\n  - 8's: 49\n  - Difference: 1\n\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 4's: 89\n  - 8's: 0\n  - Difference: 89\n\nNow, adding up the differences: 0 (units) + 1 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 90.\n\nWait, so the total number of 4's is 49 + 50 + 89 = 188, and the total number of 8's is 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. That makes sense.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nTotal numbers from 1 to 488. For units digit 4, it's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The last term is 484, which is 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, units digit 8: 8,18,28,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, 10*(n-1)=480, n-1=48, so n=49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4's, in each hundred block, 40-49, 140-149, etc., each has 10 numbers. There are 4 full hundreds, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total 40+10=50. Correct.\n\nFor 8's in tens place, each hundred block has 80-89, which is 10 numbers. 4 blocks give 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So total 40+9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 400 to 488, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers, so hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total blocks of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full blocks, plus 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n   - **4's:** 48 blocks \u00d7 1 + 1 (from 484) = 49.\n   - **8's:** 48 blocks \u00d7 1 + 1 (from 488) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - Total blocks of 100 in 488 pages: 4 full blocks, plus 88 extra numbers (401-488).\n   - **4's:** 4 blocks \u00d7 10 + 10 (from 440-449) = 50.\n   - **8's:** 4 blocks \u00d7 10 + 9 (from 480-488) = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have the hundreds digit as 4.\n   - **4's:** 89 occurrences (400-488).\n   - **8's:** 0 occurrences.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should consider how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers range from 1 to 488. That means the page numbers go up to three digits, with the highest being 488.\n\nNow, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position and then sum them up.\n\n**1. Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n- **Units place:**\n  The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's 4; in 11-20, it's 14; and so on.\n\n  Since there are 488 pages, the number of complete blocks of 10 is 48 (because 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8). Wait, but actually, each block is 10 numbers, so the number of complete blocks is 48, and then there are 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n\n  So, in the units place, the number of 4's is 48 (from each block) plus one more if the extra numbers include a 4. Let me check: the extra numbers are 481-488. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 484 has a 4 in the units place. Therefore, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- **Tens place:**\n  The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n\n  The total number of hundreds in 488 is 4 (since 488 \u00f7 100 = 4.88). So, for each hundred, we have 10 4's in the tens place. That gives 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n\n  Now, we have 88 pages beyond the 400th page. Wait, no, actually, the tens place in 400-488: the tens digit can be 0-8. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 only once (440-449). Wait, no, let me think again.\n\n  Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate how many times 4 appears in the tens place from 1 to 488.\n\n  Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, up to 400, we have 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n\n  Now, from 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in the block 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 4's in the tens place.\n\n  Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that adds 10 more. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but wait, that might be double-counting. Let me check again. From 1 to 400, each hundred has 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. From 401 to 488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but 401-488 is 88 numbers, right? So, 401-488 is 88 numbers, and the tens digit cycles every 10. So, the number of times the tens digit is 4 in this range is once, from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 10 more, making it 50.\n\n- **Hundreds place:**\n  The hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 in 400-499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds:\n\n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, but let me verify that. Because when I was counting the units place, I considered up to 488, and I added 1 for 484. Similarly, in the tens place, I considered up to 488, adding 10 for 440-449. And in the hundreds place, it's 89 times.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the tens place. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. Wait, no, because up to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 only once, but the tens digit can be 4 in each hundred.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate for each position:\n\n- For units place: For every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 full cycles, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), check if 4 is present in the units place. 484 is there, so +1. Total units 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- For tens place: For every 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, in each 100, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 488 \u00f7 100 = 4 full hundreds, contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? It's in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, +10. So total tens 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n- For hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check with a smaller number to see if my method is correct. Let's say up to page 40.\n\n- Units: 4,14,24,34,44 \u2192 5 times (but wait, 44 is two 4's, but we're counting per digit, so units digit is 4 in 4,14,24,34,44. That's 5 times.\n\n- Tens: 40-49, but up to 40, so only 40. So, tens digit is 4 once.\n\n- Hundreds: 0, since 40 is less than 100.\n\nSo, total 4's: 5 + 1 = 6. But wait, in reality, from 1-40, the 4's are:\n\nUnits: 4,14,24,34,44 \u2192 5 times.\n\nTens: 40-49, but since we're only going up to 40, it's just 40, which is one 4 in the tens place.\n\nSo, total 4's: 5 + 1 = 6. Using my method:\n\nUnits: 40 \u00f7 10 = 4, with 0 remainder. So, 4 + 0 (since no extra 4 in units beyond 40). Wait, but 40 is included, so 40 \u00f7 10 = 4, so 4 times, but in reality, it's 5 because 4,14,24,34,44. Hmm, so my method might be missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nNumber of 4's in units place = (n \u00f7 10) + (1 if the remainder is >= 4).\n\nWait, no, perhaps more accurately, it's:\n\nFor units digit, the number of times 4 appears is floor((n + 1) / 10). Because from 1 to n, the number of times each digit appears in the units place is floor((n + 1) / 10). Wait, let me test:\n\nn=40: floor((40 +1)/10) = floor(41/10)=4. But in reality, units digit 4 appears 5 times (4,14,24,34,44). So, that formula doesn't work.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is:\n\nfull_cycles = n // 10\n\nremainder = n % 10\n\ncount = full_cycles\n\nif remainder >= d:\n    count +=1\n\nSo, for d=4 and n=40:\n\nfull_cycles = 40 // 10 = 4\n\nremainder = 40 % 10 = 0\n\nsince 0 < 4, count remains 4.\n\nBut in reality, it's 5. Hmm, so perhaps the formula should be:\n\ncount = full_cycles + (1 if (remainder >= d) else 0)\n\nWait, but for n=40, remainder is 0, which is less than 4, so count=4. But actual count is 5. So, maybe the formula is off by one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that for units digit, the number of 4's is floor((n + 1) / 10). Let's test:\n\nn=40: floor((40 +1)/10)=41/10=4.1\u21924, which is still incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of 1 to n inclusive, how many times does 4 appear in units place.\n\nIt's the number of complete decades (each of 10 numbers) plus whether the current decade includes a 4.\n\nSo, for n=40:\n\nNumber of complete decades: 4 (1-10, 11-20, 21-30, 31-40)\n\nIn each decade, 4 appears once in the units place.\n\nSo, 4 times. But wait, in 31-40, the units digits go from 1-10, so 4 appears once: 34.\n\nBut wait, 40 is included, and 40 has units digit 0, so no. So, actually, from 1-40, units digit 4 appears at 4,14,24,34, which is 4 times. Wait, but 44 is beyond 40, so it's not included. So, actually, the count is 4, not 5.\n\nWait, I'm confused. Let me list them:\n\n1-10: 4\n\n11-20:14\n\n21-30:24\n\n31-40:34\n\nSo, that's 4 times. So, the formula gives 4, which is correct.\n\nBut earlier, I thought 44 is included, but 44 is beyond 40, so it's not. So, the count is 4, not 5.\n\nWait, so perhaps my initial count was wrong. So, in the case of n=40, units digit 4 appears 4 times.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nSimilarly, for n=44:\n\nNumber of complete decades: 4 (1-10,11-20,21-30,31-40)\n\nEach contributes 1, so 4.\n\nThen, the remainder is 44 - 40 = 4, so the current decade is 41-44.\n\nIn this decade, the units digits are 1,2,3,4. So, 4 appears once at 44.\n\nSo, total units 4's: 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nWhich matches the actual count: 4,14,24,34,44.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nSo, back to the original problem.\n\nFor units place:\n\nn=488.\n\nfull_cycles = 488 // 10 = 48\n\nremainder = 488 % 10 = 8\n\nSince remainder >=4, we add 1.\n\nSo, units 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nFor tens place:\n\nWe can use a similar approach but with cycles of 100.\n\nEach cycle of 100 contributes 10 times 4 in the tens place.\n\nNumber of complete cycles: 488 // 100 = 4\n\nEach contributes 10, so 4 \u00d710=40.\n\nRemainder: 488 % 100 = 88.\n\nNow, in the remainder (0-88), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nThe tens digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in 0-88, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, in the remainder, we have 88 numbers, which includes 40-49. So, that's another 10.\n\nSo, total tens 4's: 40 +10=50.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\nEach cycle of 1000 contributes 100 times 4 in the hundreds place, but since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488.\n\nSo, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1=89.\n\nSo, hundreds 4's:89.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\n**2. Counting the number of 8's:**\n\nSimilarly, I'll consider units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n- **Units place:**\n  Using the same method.\n\n  n=488.\n\n  full_cycles=488//10=48\n\n  remainder=488%10=8\n\n  Since remainder >=8, we add 1.\n\n  So, units 8's:48 +1=49.\n\n- **Tens place:**\n  full_cycles=488//100=4\n\n  Each contributes 10, so 4\u00d710=40.\n\n  remainder=488%100=88.\n\n  In the remainder, the tens digit is 8 in 80-88, which is 9 numbers (80,81,...,88). So, that's 9 times.\n\n  Wait, but in the tens place, each cycle of 100 contributes 10 times 8 in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, in the remainder (0-88), the tens digit is 8 in 80-88, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9.\n\n  So, total tens 8's:40 +9=49.\n\n- **Hundreds place:**\n  The hundreds digit is 8 only in 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds 8's:0.\n\nSo, total 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nWait, but let me verify this.\n\nWait, for the tens place, in the remainder of 88, the tens digit is 8 from 80-88, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times. So, total tens 8's:40 +9=49.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, total 8's:49 +49=98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the counts.\n\nWait, for 4's:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:50\n\nHundreds:89\n\nTotal:49+50=99; 99+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:49\n\nHundreds:0\n\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller number again to make sure.\n\nSuppose n=48.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\nUnits:4,14,24,34 \u21924 times.\n\nTens:40-49, but n=48, so 40-48: tens digit 4 appears 9 times (40-48).\n\nWait, no, in the tens place, from 1-48, the tens digit is 4 in 40-48, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nHundreds:0.\n\nTotal 4's:4+9=13.\n\n8's:\n\nUnits:8,18,28,38,48 \u21925 times.\n\nTens:48 is included, but tens digit is 4, not 8. So, tens digit 8 would be in 80-88, but n=48, so no. So, tens 8's:0.\n\nHundreds:0.\n\nTotal 8's:5.\n\nDifference:13-5=8.\n\nUsing my method:\n\nUnits 4's:48//10=4 full cycles, remainder=8. Since 8>=4, add 1:5. Wait, but actual units 4's are 4,14,24,34:4 times. Hmm, discrepancy.\n\nWait, perhaps my formula is slightly off.\n\nWait, for n=48, units digit 4's:\n\nUsing the formula: full_cycles=48//10=4, remainder=8. Since remainder >=4, add 1: total=5.\n\nBut actual count is 4:4,14,24,34.\n\nWait, because 48 is included, but 48 has units digit 8, not 4.\n\nSo, the formula overcounts by 1 in this case.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula should be:\n\nunits_count = full_cycles + (1 if (remainder > d) else 0) when d is the digit.\n\nWait, no, that might not be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is:\n\nunits_count = full_cycles + (1 if (remainder >= d) else 0) if d !=0.\n\nWait, in this case, d=4, remainder=8.\n\nSince 8 >=4, we add 1, but in reality, 48 is included, which has units digit 8, not 4. So, the 4 in units place occurs at 4,14,24,34, which is 4 times, not 5.\n\nSo, the formula is overcounting by 1.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nunits_count = full_cycles + (1 if (remainder > d) else 0).\n\nWait, for n=48, d=4:\n\nfull_cycles=4, remainder=8.\n\nSince 8>4, add 1: total=5.\n\nBut actual count is 4.\n\nHmm, that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is:\n\nunits_count = full_cycles + (1 if (remainder >= d +1) else 0).\n\nWait, testing with n=48, d=4:\n\nremainder=8 >=4+1=5? 8>=5: yes, so add 1: total=5.\n\nStill overcounts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula should be:\n\nunits_count = full_cycles + (1 if (remainder > d) else 0).\n\nSo, for n=48, d=4:\n\nremainder=8>4: yes, add 1: total=5.\n\nBut actual count is 4.\n\nHmm, maybe the formula isn't perfect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think that in each cycle of 10, the digit d appears exactly once in the units place, except possibly the last partial cycle.\n\nSo, for n=48:\n\nNumber of full cycles:4 (1-10,11-20,21-30,31-40).\n\nEach contributes 1, so 4.\n\nThen, in the last partial cycle (41-48), check if any units digit is 4. 44 is in 41-48, so add 1: total=5.\n\nBut in reality, 44 is included, so units digit 4 appears at 4,14,24,34,44:5 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 4 times. Wait, no, 44 is in 41-48, so it's 5 times.\n\nWait, but when n=48, the last page is 48, so 44 is included, so units digit 4 appears 5 times.\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was 4, but that's incorrect. So, the formula is correct.\n\nSo, for n=48, units 4's:5.\n\nTens 4's:40-48: tens digit 4 appears 9 times (40-48).\n\nSo, total 4's:5+9=14.\n\n8's:\n\nUnits:8,18,28,38,48:5 times.\n\nTens:80-88, but n=48, so none.\n\nHundreds:0.\n\nTotal 8's:5.\n\nDifference:14-5=9.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference was 8, but that was incorrect because I miscounted the units 4's.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nSo, going back, for n=488:\n\n4's:188\n\n8's:98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits '4' and '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding how many more '4's are printed than '8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** For every 10 numbers, '4' appears once. There are 48 full decades (1-480) contributing 48 '4's. The last 8 numbers (481-488) include 484, adding 1 more. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens place:** For every 100 numbers, '4' appears 10 times in the tens place. There are 4 full centuries (1-400) contributing 40 '4's. The last 88 numbers (401-488) include 440-449, adding 10 more. Total: 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, '4' appears 89 times. Total: 89.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to '4's, '8' appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 full decades contributing 48 '8's. The last 8 numbers include 488, adding 1 more. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens place:** For every 100 numbers, '8' appears 10 times in the tens place. There are 4 full centuries contributing 40 '8's. The last 88 numbers include 80-88, adding 9 more. Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** '8' does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488. Total: 0.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of '4's printed exceeds the number of '8's by 90.  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should consider how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears, then find the difference between these two counts.\n\nLet me start by considering the digits in each place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll handle each digit position one by one.\n\n**1-digit page numbers:**\nThese are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digits 4 and 8 each appear once. So, 4 appears once, and 8 appears once. The difference here is zero.\n\n**2-digit page numbers:**\nThese are from 10 to 99. I'll need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place and the units place.\n\n- **Tens place:**\n  - For 4: The tens digit is 4 in the range 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n  - For 8: The tens digit is 8 in the range 80-89. That's another 10 numbers, so 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n  \n- **Units place:**\n  - For 4: In every set of ten numbers (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. From 10 to 99, there are 9 sets of ten (since 10-99 is 90 numbers), so 4 appears 9 times in the units place.\n  - For 8: Similarly, 8 appears once in each set of ten, so 9 times in the units place.\n\nSo, for two-digit numbers:\n- 4's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n- 8's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\nDifference so far: 19 - 19 = 0\n\nWait, but wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check. From 10 to 99, the units digit cycles 0-9 nine times, so yes, 9 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place. And the tens digit for 4 and 8 is each 10 times. So, yes, 19 each. So the difference is zero so far.\n\n**3-digit page numbers:**\nThese are from 100 to 488. Now, this is more complex because we have hundreds, tens, and units digits. Let me break this down.\n\nI think I should consider the hundreds, tens, and units places separately again.\n\n- **Hundreds place:**\n  - The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book has 488 pages. So, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n  \n  - For 4: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n  \n  - For 8: The hundreds digit is 8? Wait, no, because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit doesn't reach 8. So, 8 appears zero times in the hundreds place.\n\n- **Tens place:**\n  - Now, let's look at the tens digit. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. But since we go up to 488, the last hundred (400-488) might not complete the full 100 numbers, so I need to check that.\n\n  Let me break it down:\n  \n  - For 100-199: The tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times.\n  - For 200-299: Same as above, 10 each.\n  - For 300-399: Same, 10 each.\n  - For 400-488: The tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here?\n\n  Let's see:\n  - From 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409), 1 (410-419), ..., up to 8 (480-488). Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place in 400-488:\n    - 4 appears in the tens place when the tens digit is 4, which is from 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n    - 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 times.\n\n  So, adding up:\n  - 4's in tens place across all hundreds:\n    - 100-199: 10\n    - 200-299: 10\n    - 300-399: 10\n    - 400-488: 10\n    Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40\n  - 8's in tens place across all hundreds:\n    - 100-199: 10\n    - 200-299: 10\n    - 300-399: 10\n    - 400-488: 9\n    Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n\n- **Units place:**\n  Now, for the units digit, each digit from 0-9 appears equally in each position, except possibly the last set if the total number isn't a multiple of 10.\n\n  Let's break it down:\n  \n  - For 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: Each hundred has 100 numbers, so each digit (including 4 and 8) appears 10 times in the units place per hundred. So:\n    - 4's: 10 per hundred * 3 hundreds = 30\n    - 8's: 10 per hundred * 3 hundreds = 30\n  - For 400-488: There are 89 numbers here (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the units place?\n\n  Let's calculate:\n  - The units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in 89 numbers, how many full cycles are there? 89 divided by 10 is 8 full cycles (80 numbers) and 9 remaining numbers.\n\n  - In each full cycle, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, 8 cycles give 8 times each.\n  - In the remaining 9 numbers (480-488), the units digits go from 0 to 8. So, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488).\n  - So total in 400-488:\n    - 4's: 8 (from full cycles) + 1 (from remaining) = 9\n    - 8's: 8 (from full cycles) + 1 (from remaining) = 9\n\n  So, total units place:\n  - 4's: 30 (from first three hundreds) + 9 = 39\n  - 8's: 30 + 9 = 39\n\nWait, that can't be right because from 400-488, the units digits for 4 and 8 each appear 9 times. So, adding to the previous 30, we get 39 each.\n\nWait, but let me check: For 400-488, which is 89 numbers, the units digits go from 0 to 9 for each ten. So, 400-409: units 0-9, so 4 and 8 each once. Similarly, 410-419: same, etc. How many tens are there? From 400-488, that's 9 tens (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488). Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so it's not a full ten. So, in each full ten, 4 and 8 appear once in the units place.\n\nSo, for 400-488:\n- Number of full tens: 8 (from 400-409 up to 470-479)\n- Each full ten contributes 1 to 4's and 1 to 8's, so 8 each.\n- Then, the last partial ten is 480-488, which has units digits 0-8. So, 4 appears at 484 and 8 appears at 488, so that's one each.\n- So total in 400-488:\n  - 4's: 8 + 1 = 9\n  - 8's: 8 + 1 = 9\n\nSo, units place total:\n- 4's: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 = 39\n- 8's: 30 + 9 = 39\n\nNow, let me sum up all the digits for 3-digit numbers.\n\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 4's: 89\n  - 8's: 0\n- Tens place:\n  - 4's: 40\n  - 8's: 39\n- Units place:\n  - 4's: 39\n  - 8's: 39\n\nSo, total for 3-digit numbers:\n- 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n- 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nWait, let me add that again:\n- Hundreds: 89\n- Tens: 40\n- Units: 39\nTotal 4's: 89 + 40 = 129, plus 39 is 168.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Hundreds: 0\n- Tens: 39\n- Units: 39\nTotal: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nNow, let's add up all page numbers:\n\n1-digit:\n- 4's: 1\n- 8's: 1\n\n2-digit:\n- 4's: 19\n- 8's: 19\n\n3-digit:\n- 4's: 168\n- 8's: 78\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations, especially for the 3-digit numbers.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for 3-digit numbers, I had:\n\n- 4's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-449) = 40\n- 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n\nWait, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. But in 480-488, the tens digit is 8, which is 9 times, as 480-488 is 9 numbers. So that's correct.\n\nUnits place:\n- For 100-399, each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's, so 3*10=30 each.\n- In 400-488, 89 numbers, as calculated, contribute 9 4's and 9 8's in units place.\n\nSo, 30 + 9 = 39 each. That seems correct.\n\nSo, 3-digit 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n3-digit 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nAdding 1-digit and 2-digit:\n- 4's: 1 + 19 = 20\n- 8's: 1 + 19 = 20\n\nTotal 4's: 20 + 168 = 188\nTotal 8's: 20 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the 3-digit tens place for 8's. Let me recount:\n\nFor 3-digit numbers:\n\n- 100-199: tens digit 4 and 8 each appear 10 times.\n- 200-299: same, 10 each.\n- 300-399: same, 10 each.\n- 400-488: tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n\nSo, for 4's in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40\nFor 8's in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n\nThat's correct.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 100-399: 30 each\n- 400-488: 9 each\n\nTotal units: 39 each.\n\nSo, yes, 3-digit 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\n3-digit 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nAdding 1-digit and 2-digit:\n\n- 4's: 1 + 19 = 20\n- 8's: 1 + 19 = 20\n\nTotal 4's: 20 + 168 = 188\nTotal 8's: 20 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**1-digit page numbers (1-9):**\n- 4 appears once.\n- 8 appears once.\n- Difference: 0.\n\n**2-digit page numbers (10-99):**\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n- **Units place:** Each digit appears 9 times (once per ten numbers).\n- Total 4's: 10 + 9 = 19.\n- Total 8's: 10 + 9 = 19.\n- Difference: 0.\n\n**3-digit page numbers (100-488):**\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 appears 0 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n- **Units place:** Each digit appears 39 times.\n- Total 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n- Total 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n- Difference: 168 - 78 = 90.\n\n**Total across all page numbers:**\n- 4's: 1 (1-digit) + 19 (2-digit) + 168 (3-digit) = 188.\n- 8's: 1 (1-digit) + 19 (2-digit) + 78 (3-digit) = 98.\n- Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should understand the problem clearly. The book has pages numbered from 1 to 488, and each page number is printed once. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nAlright, so I guess the strategy here is to count the occurrences of each digit separately. I'll probably need to consider each digit position\u2014units, tens, hundreds\u2014and calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in each position across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in a sequence of numbers. But wait, in page numbers starting from 1, the first page is 1, so the units digit cycles from 1 to 9, then 0, then 1 again, and so on. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of cycles of 10 numbers.\n\nSo, for the units place, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. But since we're starting at 1, the first block is 1-10, which includes 0 in the units place for page 10. Wait, but page 1 is 1, so in the first block, the units digits go from 1 to 0. Hmm, maybe it's better to think that in each block of 10, the digits 0-9 appear once each in the units place, except the first block which is 1-10, so 0 appears once (at 10). Wait, actually, 10 is included in the first block, so yes, 0 appears once in the units place in the first block as well.\n\nSo, for the units place, the number of times 4 appears would be equal to the number of complete tens in the total number of pages, plus any extra in the incomplete block if the total isn't a multiple of 10. Similarly for 8.\n\nWait, but let me check. The total number of pages is 488. So, how many complete tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete tens and an incomplete block of 8 numbers (from 481 to 488). \n\nIn each complete ten, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so each digit appears once. So, for each complete ten, 4 appears once in the units place, and 8 appears once as well. So, for 48 complete tens, the number of 4's in the units place is 48, and the same for 8's.\n\nNow, in the incomplete block from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this block, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once in the units place (at 484), and 8 appears once (at 488). So, in the incomplete block, units place contributes 1 more 4 and 1 more 8.\n\nSo, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTotal units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So, the difference in units place is zero.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. Let's analyze how often 4 and 8 appear in the tens digit.\n\nThe tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 91-100). Wait, but actually, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, up to 9 for 90-99, and then 0 again for 100.\n\nWait, but in our case, the book has 488 pages, so we go up to 488. So, the tens digit can be from 0 to 9, but we have to consider how many times each digit appears in the tens place from 1 to 488.\n\nLet me think: For the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, ..., 9 for 90-99. So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for each 100 numbers.\n\nBut wait, 100 is included, so from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9, each appearing 10 times. So, for 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and an incomplete block from 401-488.\n\nIn each complete hundred, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for each complete hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times as well.\n\nSo, for 4 complete hundreds, the number of 4's in the tens place is 4 * 10 = 40, and same for 8's: 40.\n\nNow, in the incomplete block from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but let's check how many times each digit appears.\n\nWait, from 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). But wait, 401 is 401, so the tens digit is 0, and then 410 is included, so the tens digit is 0 for 401-410 (10 numbers). Then 411-420: tens digit 1, 421-430: tens digit 2, ..., 480-488: tens digit 8.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488), so the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers.\n\nWait, but let me count how many times each tens digit appears in 401-488.\n\n- Tens digit 0: 401-410: 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 1: 411-420: 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 2: 421-430: 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 3: 431-440: 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 4: 441-450: 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 5: 451-460: 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 6: 461-470: 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 7: 471-480: 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 8: 481-488: 8 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nWait, so in the incomplete block, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times, and the other digits from 0 to 7 appear 10 times each. Wait, but 481-488 is 8 numbers, so tens digit 8 appears 8 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: 481-488 is 8 numbers, right? 481,482,...,488. So, yes, 8 numbers with tens digit 8.\n\nSo, in the incomplete block, the number of times 4 appears in the tens place: when the tens digit is 4, which is 441-450, that's 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, the number of times 8 appears in the tens place is 8 times, as from 481-488.\n\nWait, but wait: 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers, correct.\n\nSo, in the incomplete block, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 4 complete hundreds *10 =40, plus 10 from the incomplete block: total 50.\n\nTotal tens place 8's: 4 complete hundreds *10 =40, plus 8 from the incomplete block: total 48.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 48 times. So, the difference here is 50 - 48 = 2 more 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, so far, in the tens place, 4's are more by 2.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. Let's see how often 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds digit.\n\nThe hundreds digit is only relevant for numbers from 100 onwards. So, in 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so it doesn't contribute to 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 100-488, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nSpecifically, 100-199: hundreds digit 1\n200-299: hundreds digit 2\n300-399: hundreds digit 3\n400-488: hundreds digit 4\n\nSo, let's count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place.\n\nFor 4's: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nFor 8's: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so 800-899 isn't included. Therefore, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all in this book. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times, and 8's appear 0 times. So, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate: 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 97.\n\nNow, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- Each complete ten (10 numbers) contributes 1 four and 1 eight in the units place.\n- There are 48 complete tens in 488, so 48 fours and 48 eights.\n- The incomplete block from 481-488 has units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488).\n- So, units place: 48 +1 =49 fours, 48 +1=49 eights. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each complete hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place.\n- 4 complete hundreds (1-400) give 4*10=40 fours and 4*10=40 eights.\n- In the incomplete block 401-488:\n  - Tens digit 4 appears in 441-450: 10 numbers, so 10 fours.\n  - Tens digit 8 appears in 481-488: 8 numbers, so 8 eights.\n- So, total tens place: 40+10=50 fours, 40+8=48 eights. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n- 8's: None, since the book ends at 488, so 0 eights.\n- So, hundreds place: 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\nAdding up:\n\nFours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nEights: 49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =97.\n\nDifference: 188 -97=91.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I should check another way. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write a small table to count the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to think about each digit position separately.\n\nWait, another way: for each position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nWait, but I think I've already done that. So, perhaps the answer is 91.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place. So, from 400-488, that's 488 - 400 +1 =89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nAnd for the eights, since the book ends at 488, there's no page with 800 or above, so no eights in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights there.\n\nSo, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place, 0 eights. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the tens place again. In the incomplete block 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does each appear?\n\nWait, 401-488: that's 88 numbers (488 - 401 +1=88). Wait, no, 401 to 488 is 488-401=87, plus 1 is 88 numbers. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 89 numbers, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, right? Because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89.\n\nWait, in the incomplete block, I think I was considering 401-488, which is 88 numbers, but in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, perhaps I made a mistake there.\n\nWait, no, in the hundreds place, 400-488 includes 400, which is 400-488: 89 numbers. But in the tens place, when considering 401-488, that's 488-401+1=88 numbers.\n\nWait, so perhaps I made a mistake in the tens place calculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the incomplete block from 401-488, which is 88 numbers, how many times does each tens digit appear?\n\n- Tens digit 0: 401-410: 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 1: 411-420: 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 2: 421-430: 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 3: 431-440: 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 4: 441-450: 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 5: 451-460: 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 6: 461-470: 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 7: 471-480: 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 8: 481-488: 8 numbers\n\nWait, but 401-410 is 10 numbers, 411-420 is another 10, up to 471-480: another 10, and then 481-488: 8 numbers.\n\nSo, total numbers: 10*8 +8=88, which matches 401-488 being 88 numbers.\n\nSo, in this incomplete block, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and the tens digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n\nSo, in the tens place, the total for 4's is 4 complete hundreds *10=40, plus 10 in the incomplete block: 50.\n\nFor 8's, it's 4 complete hundreds *10=40, plus 8 in the incomplete block: 48.\n\nSo, that part seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that 401-488 is 88 numbers, but in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, including 400. So, 400 is included in the hundreds place calculation, but 400 is in 400-488, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, 401-488 is 88 numbers, so the tens digits in 400 are 0, but 400 is included in the hundreds place, but in the tens place, 400 would have a tens digit of 0, but since we're starting from 401, 400 isn't included in the incomplete block for the tens place. Wait, no, 400 is included in the hundreds place, but in the tens place, 400 is part of the 400-409 block, which would have a tens digit of 0. But since we're considering 401-488, 400 is not included in that. So, perhaps I should adjust the count.\n\nWait, so in the incomplete block for the tens place, from 401-488, which is 88 numbers, the tens digits are as I listed before: 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), etc., up to 8 (481-488). So, that's correct.\n\nSo, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times in 441-450, and 8 appears 8 times in 481-488.\n\nSo, the counts for tens place are correct.\n\nWait, so total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188.\n\n8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nSo, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just check if I counted the hundreds place correctly. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with hundreds digit 4, so that's 89 fours. That seems correct.\n\nAnd since there's no page with hundreds digit 8 in a 488-page book, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total complete tens in 488 pages: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 with a remainder of 8).\n   - Each digit appears 48 times in the units place.\n   - In the incomplete block (481-488), '4' appears once (484) and '8' appears once (488).\n   - Total '4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total '8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - Complete hundreds in 488 pages: 4 (1-400).\n   - Each digit appears 40 times in the tens place from complete hundreds.\n   - In the incomplete block (401-488):\n     - '4' appears 10 times (441-450).\n     - '8' appears 8 times (481-488).\n   - Total '4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total '8's in tens place: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Only numbers 400-488 have '4' in the hundreds place.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - '4' appears 89 times.\n   - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place (since pages go up to 488).\n   - Total '4's in hundreds place: 89.\n   - Total '8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - Total '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - Total '8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (number of '4's) - 97 (number of '8's) = 91.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe digit '4' is printed 91 more times than the digit '8'.  \n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should consider each digit place separately\u2014like the units place, tens place, and maybe even the hundreds place\u2014because the number of times a digit appears can vary depending on its position. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 pages (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. Similarly, the digit 8 also appears once. Since there are 488 pages, I can calculate how many full blocks of 10 there are and then see if there are any extra pages beyond that. \n\nSo, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. That means there are 48 full blocks of 10 pages and then 8 extra pages. In each block, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, 48 times 1 for 4's and 48 times 1 for 8's. That gives me 48 each. Now, looking at the extra 8 pages (481-488), I need to check if any of these have a 4 or 8 in the units place. \n\nLooking at 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 has a 4 in the units place, and 488 has an 8. Therefore, in the units place, 4 appears once more (total of 49) and 8 appears once more (total of 49). Wait, so in the units place, both digits appear 49 times. That means they're equal in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in every block of 100 pages. For example, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times in 40-49, and similarly for 8 in 80-89. \n\nSo, let's figure out how many full blocks of 100 there are in 488. 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, there are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each full block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and the same for 8 (80-89). So, 4 times 10 is 40 for 4's, and 4 times 10 is 40 for 8's. \n\nNow, looking at the remaining 88 pages (401-488), I need to check the tens place. The tens digits here go from 0 (in 401-410) up to 8 (in 481-488). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? \n\nFrom 440-449, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 times. But wait, our range is only up to 488, so 440-449 is fully included. So that's 10 times. \n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place, we have 480-488. The tens digit here is 8, but how many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here. \n\nAdding this to the previous total: 40 (from full blocks) + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. \n\nWait, that means in the tens place, there's one more 4 than 8. \n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit in a 3-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. \n\nFor 4's in the hundreds place: It appears in pages 400-488. That's 89 pages (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. \n\nFor 8's in the hundreds place: Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times. \n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times and 8 appears 0 times. \n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences for each digit. \n\nStarting with 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nNow for 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place: 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing 1 for 4 and 8, so 48 each. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), 484 has a 4 and 488 has an 8. So, units place totals: 48 +1 =49 for 4, and 48 +1=49 for 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each full block of 100 has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. 4 blocks, so 40 each. Then, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. For 4's, 440-449 is 10 pages, so 10 more 4's. For 8's, 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9 more 8's. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50, and 8's:40+9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 4's. 8's: 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89= 188\n\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98\n\nDifference:188 -98=90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 full blocks (480 pages) and 8 extra pages (481-488).\n   - In the extra pages, 484 has a 4 and 488 has an 8.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 pages contributes 10 4's and 10 8's.\n   - There are 4 full blocks (400 pages), contributing 40 each.\n   - In the remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n     - 440-449 contributes 10 4's.\n     - 480-488 contributes 9 8's.\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 contribute 89 4's.\n   - No pages have an 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488 and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the positions where the digits can appear: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll handle each place separately for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:** The digits cycle every 10 numbers, so in every set of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, I can calculate how many full tens are there in 488 pages.\n\n   Total number of tens in 488 is 488 divided by 10, which is 48 full tens with a remainder of 8. So, the digit 4 appears 48 times in the units place. But wait, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 481, 482, ..., 488. The digit 4 doesn't appear here because 481 ends with 1, 482 with 2, and so on up to 488. So, no additional 4's in the units place beyond the 48 full tens. So, units place contributes 48 fours.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 pages. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. \n\n   Let me count how many such sets there are. From 1-488, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. Wait, actually, the hundreds digit starts from 0 (for 1-99), then 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488). \n\n   So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers. So, for hundreds 0,1,2,3, each contributes 10 fours in the tens place. That's 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40 fours. Now, for the hundreds digit 4, which is 400-488, the tens digit 4 would be from 440-449. That's another 10 fours. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 fours.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 +89=187. So, 187 fours in total.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units place: 48, tens place: 50, hundreds place:89. 48+50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. That seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the digit 8:\n\nI'll follow the same approach.\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, similar to 4, in each full ten, there's one 8 in the units place. \n\n   Total number of full tens in 488 is 48, as before. So, units place contributes 48 eights. Now, in the last partial set, 481-488, the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included. So, in this last partial set, the units digit 8 appears once. Therefore, total units place eights are 48 +1=49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 pages. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. \n\n   Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers, not 10. So, let's see:\n\n   For hundreds 0,1,2,3: each contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. For hundreds 4, the tens digit 8 is from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 eights in the tens place for hundreds 4.\n\n   So, total tens place eights: 40 +9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nAdding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nSo, total eights are 98.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Units place: 48 full tens give 48 eights, and the last partial set (481-488) includes 488, so units digit 8 appears once, making 49. Tens place: for hundreds 0,1,2,3, each has 10 eights, so 4*10=40. For hundreds 4, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 40+9=49. Hundreds place: 0. So, total eights: 49+49=98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the number of fours is 187 and eights is 98. So, the difference is 187 -98=89.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me check my calculations again because 187-98 is 89, but I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me recount the fours:\n\n- Units place: 48 fours. That's correct because 488/10=48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and the last 8 pages (481-488) don't include a 4 in the units place, so 48 fours.\n\n- Tens place: For each hundred, 10 fours in the tens place. From 0 to 4 hundreds, that's 5 hundreds, but wait, 400-488 is only 89 pages, so does that affect the tens place?\n\nWait, no. The tens digit cycles every 100, so in each hundred, the tens digit 4 occurs exactly 10 times. So, for hundreds 0,1,2,3, each contributes 10 fours in the tens place, that's 4*10=40. Then, for hundreds 4, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40+10=50 fours in the tens place. That seems correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total fours: 48+50+89=187. That seems correct.\n\nNow, for eights:\n\n- Units place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the last partial set 481-488 includes 488, so units digit 8 appears once. So, 48+1=49.\n\n- Tens place: For hundreds 0,1,2,3, each contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. For hundreds 4, the tens digit 8 is from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 40+9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, as before.\n\nTotal eights: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, difference is 187-98=89.\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if I made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check: 400-488 is 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so 89 fours. That's correct.\n\nAnd for eights, since the hundreds digit never reaches 8, that's 0.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 89.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly for the tens place in eights? For hundreds 4, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 40 (from hundreds 0-3) +9=49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the answer should be 89 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (once every 10 numbers, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 full sets).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (10 per hundred for 0-399, and 10 in 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488).\n**Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (48 full sets plus 1 in 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (10 per hundred for 0-399, and 9 in 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should consider how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. That means the highest page number is a three-digit number, 488.\n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place (the first digit from the right):**\n   - For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - How many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488).\n   - So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times from the full groups. Now, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (484).\n   - Therefore, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place (the second digit from the right):**\n   - Here, the digit 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers, 10 times in each block. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Let's figure out how many full blocks of 100 there are in 488. That's 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then the remaining 88 pages (401-488).\n   - In each full block, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so 4 blocks give 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n   - Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488. So, that's another 10 times.\n   - So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place (the third digit from the right):**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total.\n\nNext, I'll do the same process for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning 48 full groups and 8 extra numbers.\n   - In the units place, 8 appears 48 times from the full groups. In the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each full block of 100 has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. There are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n   - In the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-8. The tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, 9 times.\n   - Wait, actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's 9 times.\n   - So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8.\n   - Therefore, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 full groups (1-480) each contributing 1, so 48, plus 484, so 49.\n- Tens: 4 full blocks (1-400) each contributing 10, so 40, plus 440-449, which is 10, so 50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full groups (1-480) each contributing 1, so 48, plus 488, so 49.\n- Tens: 4 full blocks (1-400) each contributing 10, so 40, plus 480-488, which is 9, so 49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. In the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with tens digit 8, so that's 9. So, 40 (from full blocks) + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, the remaining 88 pages include 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so 89 numbers. That's correct.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because 4 appears more in the hundreds place, which is 89 times, whereas 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, that's a big difference right there.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full groups of 10 (each contributing 1) + 1 extra (484) = 49\n- **Tens place:** 4 full blocks of 100 (each contributing 10) + 10 from 440-449 = 50\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 numbers (400-488) = 89\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full groups of 10 + 1 extra (488) = 49\n- **Tens place:** 4 full blocks of 100 + 9 from 480-488 = 49\n- **Hundreds place:** 0\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488 and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the count of 8's from the count of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense because the question is asking how many more 4's there are than 8's.\n\nLet me start by considering how numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488, which is a three-digit number. So, I need to consider units, tens, and hundreds places separately for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nMaybe I should handle each digit place one by one. Let's start with the units place. For the units digit, how often does 4 appear? Well, in every block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, to find the total number of times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide 488 by 10 and take the integer part, which would give me the number of complete decades. \n\nWait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That would be 48 times. But wait, does the 488th page include another 4 in the units place? Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, meaning 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4. So, units place for 4 is 48 times.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, it would be the same logic. Each decade has one 8 in the units place, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, again, 48 times for 8 in the units place. Wait, but 488 is included, so in the units place, 8 appears once more? Let me think: 488 is the last page, so in the units place, 8 appears in 8, 18, ..., 488. So, how many times is that? Let me calculate 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, so again 48 times. Wait, but 488 is 48*10 + 8, so does that count as the 49th occurrence? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Since 488 is the last page, the units digit 8 appears 48 times because from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, there's one 8 in the units place, and 488 is the 49th occurrence, but wait, 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8. So, actually, it's 49 times. Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th decade? Let me check: 1-10 is decade 1, 11-20 decade 2, ..., 481-490 would be decade 49, but since we're only going up to 488, the 49th decade isn't complete. So, the units digit 8 appears 48 times in the units place because 488 is the 49th occurrence but only up to 488, so it's 48 times. Wait, no, 8 appears once in each decade, so from 1 to 480, that's 480/10 = 48 times, and then in 481-488, there's another 8 in 488, so that's 49 times. Wait, that makes sense because 488 is included, so units digit 8 appears 49 times. Hmm, so maybe I was wrong earlier about 4. Let me check for 4 in the units place: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. 484 is 48*10 + 4, so that's the 48th occurrence. Then, 494 would be next, but 494 is beyond 488, so units digit 4 appears 48 times. So, units place: 4 appears 48 times, 8 appears 49 times. Wait, so 8 has one more in the units place. Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, how often does 4 appear? Well, in each block of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149, 240-249, etc. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n\nLet me think: from 1-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 times, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50 times 4 in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place, it appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, the tens digit 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 times except the last one, which only goes up to 488, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers, since 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in that last block. So, total for 8 in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus the last block 480-488 which is 9 times, so total 49 times.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: from 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? \n\n- 80-89: 10 times\n- 180-189: 10 times\n- 280-289: 10 times\n- 380-389: 10 times\n- 480-488: 9 times\n\nSo total is 10+10+10+10+9=49 times.\n\nSo, for the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. For the hundreds digit, how often does 4 appear? Well, in the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nFor the digit 8 in the hundreds place, does it appear? Well, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. 8 in the hundreds place would require the page number to be 800 or higher, which doesn't happen here. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place in this book. So, 0 times.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit.\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 48+50=98, 98+89=187.\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check these calculations because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, for the units place, I concluded that 4 appears 48 times and 8 appears 49 times. Then, for the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo total 4's: 48 + 50 +89 = 48+50=98, 98+89=187.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 +49 +0=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 -98=89.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me see if I did everything correctly.\n\nWait, let me recheck the units place for 4 and 8.\n\nUnits place for 4: every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there? The last term is 484, which is 4 + (n-1)*10=484. So, n-1=(484-4)/10=480/10=48, so n=49. Wait, that's 49 times. But earlier, I thought it was 48 times because 488/10=48.8, so 48 full decades. But according to this, it's 49 times because 484 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 484 is less than 488, so it's included, so units digit 4 appears 49 times. Hmm, so maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me recast this.\n\nWait, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1-10: 4 appears once (at 4). 11-20: once at 14. So, each decade contributes once. So, from 1-480, how many decades? 480/10=48, so 48 times. Then, from 481-488, which is 8 numbers, does 4 appear in the units place? 484 is in 481-488, so that's one more, making it 49 times. So, units digit 4 appears 49 times, not 48.\n\nSimilarly, for units digit 8: from 1-480, 48 decades, each contributing once, so 48 times. Then, from 481-488, 488 is included, so that's another 8 in the units place, making it 49 times. So, both units digits for 4 and 8 are 49 times each.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4 was 48 and 8 was 49, but now I'm seeing both are 49. So, I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, units place:\n- 4: 49 times\n- 8: 49 times\n\nTens place:\n- 4: let's recount. The tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, each contributing 10 times, so 5*10=50 times.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, 5 blocks, but the last one is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, 4 full blocks of 10, and one partial block of 9. So, 4*10=40 +9=49 times.\n\nSo, tens place:\n- 4:50\n- 8:49\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n- 8: 0 times.\n\nSo, total for 4:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal=49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal for 8:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal=49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 187 and 8's 98, difference 89, but now it's 188-98=90. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in the initial count of units digit 4. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, units digit 4: from 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 484=4 + (n-1)*10 \u2192 480=(n-1)*10 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 times. So, units digit 4 is 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, units digit 8: from 8,18,...,488. 488=8 + (n-1)*10 \u2192 480=(n-1)*10 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 times.\n\nSo, units digits: both 49.\n\nTens digits: 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nHundreds digits: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so the initial mistake was in the units digit count for 4, which I first thought was 48 but is actually 49. So, the correct difference is 90.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the hundreds place for 4. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 times. That's correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place, 4 appears in 5 blocks of 10, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place, 4 full blocks of 10 and one partial block of 9, so 4*10+9=49. Correct.\n\nUnits digits: both 49. So, 4's total 188, 8's total 98. Difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the difference was 89, but now it's 90. I need to make sure.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\n4's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal=49+50=99; 99+89=188.\n\n8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal=49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, as in 5 blocks of 10. Correct.\n\nUnits digits: both 49. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 90.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to see if my method is correct. Let's say a 100-page book. How many 4's and 8's?\n\nUnits digit:\n\n4 appears 10 times (4,14,...,94).\n\n8 appears 10 times (8,18,...,98).\n\nTens digit:\n\n4 appears in 40-49:10 times.\n\n8 appears in 80-89:10 times.\n\nHundreds digit: 0 for both.\n\nTotal 4's:10+10=20.\n\nTotal 8's:10+10=20.\n\nDifference:0.\n\nBut in reality, from 1-100, the number of 4's and 8's should be equal. So, my method works here.\n\nAnother example: 10-page book.\n\nUnits digits:\n\n4 appears once (4).\n\n8 appears once (8).\n\nTens digits: none, since all are single-digit.\n\nTotal 4's:1.\n\nTotal 8's:1.\n\nDifference:0.\n\nAnother example: 20-page book.\n\nUnits digits:\n\n4 appears twice (4,14).\n\n8 appears twice (8,18).\n\nTens digits:\n\n4 appears in 40-49, but 20 is less than 40, so no.\n\n8 appears in 80-89, which is beyond 20.\n\nSo, total 4's:2.\n\nTotal 8's:2.\n\nDifference:0.\n\nWait, but if the book was 45 pages, how many 4's and 8's?\n\nUnits digits:\n\n4 appears five times (4,14,24,34,44).\n\n8 appears five times (8,18,28,38,48). But wait, 48 is beyond 45, so only four times:8,18,28,38.\n\nSo, units digits:4 appears 4 times (4,14,24,34), 8 appears 4 times (8,18,28,38).\n\nTens digits:\n\n4 appears in 40-44: five times (40,41,42,43,44).\n\n8 appears in 40-44? No, 80-89 is beyond 45, so 0.\n\nSo, total 4's:4 (units) +5 (tens)=9.\n\nTotal 8's:4 (units)+0=4.\n\nDifference:5.\n\nWait, according to my method:\n\nUnits digits:\n\n4: floor(45/10)=4 full decades, so 4 times, plus if the last partial decade includes 4, which it does (44), so 4+1=5? Wait, no, 45/10=4.5, so 4 full decades, each contributing once, so 4 times. But 44 is included, which is the 5th occurrence. So, 5 times.\n\nSimilarly, 8 in units: floor(45/10)=4 full decades, each contributing once, so 4 times. 48 is beyond 45, so no extra.\n\nSo, units digits:4 appears 5 times, 8 appears 4 times.\n\nTens digits:\n\n4 appears in 40-44: five numbers, so 5 times.\n\n8 appears in 80-89, which is beyond 45, so 0.\n\nSo, total 4's:5+5=10.\n\nTotal 8's:4+0=4.\n\nDifference:6.\n\nWait, but when I manually counted earlier, I thought 4's were 9 and 8's 4, difference 5. So, there's a discrepancy. Hmm, maybe my method is slightly off.\n\nWait, let's manually count for 1-45:\n\nNumbers with 4 in units place:4,14,24,34,44 \u21925 times.\n\nNumbers with 8 in units place:8,18,28,38 \u21924 times.\n\nNumbers with 4 in tens place:40,41,42,43,44 \u21925 times.\n\nNumbers with 8 in tens place: none, since 80-89 is beyond 45.\n\nSo, total 4's:5+5=10.\n\nTotal 8's:4+0=4.\n\nDifference:6.\n\nSo, according to my method, it's correct. So, in the 45-page book, there are 6 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 9 and 8's 4, but that was a mistake. Actually, 4's are 10, 8's are 4, difference 6.\n\nSo, my method works. So, returning to the original problem, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm again for the 488-page book.\n\nUnits digits:\n\n4:49 times.\n\n8:49 times.\n\nTens digits:\n\n4:50 times.\n\n8:49 times.\n\nHundreds digits:\n\n4:89 times.\n\n8:0 times.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades (1-480) and an additional 8 numbers (481-488). The digit 4 appears in the units place 49 times (4, 14, ..., 484).\n   - **Tens Place:** 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each block of 100 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 5 such blocks up to 488, contributing 50 times.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 times.\n\n   **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades and an additional 8 numbers, contributing 49 times (8, 18, ..., 488).\n   - **Tens Place:** 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each block of 100, except the last block which has 9 numbers (480-488). This gives 49 times.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n\n   **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488. Then, I'll do the same for the digit 8 and subtract the two counts to find the difference. That makes sense.\n\nLet me start by considering how numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 up to 488. So, I'll need to analyze each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nI'll tackle each digit place one by one for both 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the digit 4 appears once every 10 pages, and the same goes for 8.\n\nBut wait, I need to consider how many such blocks there are in 488 pages. Let's calculate how many complete tens are there in 488. That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we're dealing with complete blocks, there are 48 complete tens, and then an extra 8 pages (from 481 to 488).\n\nIn each of these 48 complete tens, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Similarly, 8 appears 48 times in the units place from the complete tens. Now, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, adding these, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. Hmm, but let me double-check that. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning 48 full tens and a partial of 8 pages. Each full ten gives one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 each. The partial ten from 481 to 488: units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, yes, 49 each. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place:\n\nThe tens digit cycles every 100 pages. In each block of 100, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, ..., 9 for 90-99. So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place per 100 pages.\n\nSo, in 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred from 401-488.\n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 4 times 10 is 40. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times in each hundred, so 4 times 10 is 40.\n\nNow, the partial hundred from 401-488. Let's see, the tens digit here goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? Let's see, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So, that's 10 times. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so the tens digit is 4 ten times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place in 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page. Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the partial hundred.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 times. The digit 8 appears in the tens place in 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 9 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, the total number of 4's is 40 (from the complete hundreds) + 10 (from the partial hundred) = 50. And the total number of 8's is 40 (from the complete hundreds) + 9 (from the partial hundred) = 49.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place:\n\nThe hundreds digit is a bit different. Each digit from 1 to 4 appears in the hundreds place for 100 pages each. So, 1 in 1-99, 2 in 100-199, 3 in 200-299, 4 in 300-399, and then 4 continues in 400-488. Wait, actually, 400-488 is part of the 400s, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 99 pages (400-499), but since the book ends at 488, it's 89 pages (from 400 to 488 inclusive). Wait, no, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The hundreds digit is 1 for 1-99 (99 pages), 2 for 100-199 (100 pages), 3 for 200-299 (100 pages), and 4 for 300-399 (100 pages) and 400-488 (89 pages). So, total pages with hundreds digit 4 are 100 (300-399) + 89 (400-488) = 189 pages. But wait, actually, no. Wait, 300-399 is 100 pages, and 400-488 is 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 189 pages. But each page where the hundreds digit is 4 contributes one 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? It's the number of pages where the hundreds digit is 4, which is 189 pages. So, 189 times.\n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in 488, the hundreds digit is 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. The hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, which is still in the 400s. So, yes, 0 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 189 times and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 189\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 189 = Let's compute that. 49+50=99, 99+189=288.\n\nFor 8:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 288, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 288 - 98 = 190.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- 488 pages, so 48 full tens (480 pages) and 8 extra pages (481-488). Each full ten contributes 1 four and 1 eight in units place, so 48 each. The extra 8 pages: units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- 488 pages, so 4 full hundreds (400 pages) and 88 extra pages (401-488). Each full hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in tens place, so 4*10=40 each. The extra 88 pages: tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). The digit 4 appears in the tens place from 440-449, which is 10 pages. The digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 40+10=50 fours, 40+9=49 eights. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, 89 fours. But wait, earlier I thought it was 189 because 300-399 is 100 pages, and 400-488 is 89 pages. Wait, no, the hundreds digit is 4 in 300-399? No, wait. The hundreds digit is 3 in 300-399, and 4 in 400-488. So, 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but earlier I thought 300-399 is 100 pages with hundreds digit 3, and 400-488 is 89 pages with hundreds digit 4. So, the total fours in hundreds place are 89, not 189. Oh no, I think I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me correct that. The hundreds digit is 4 only in 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, the number of 4's in the hundreds place is 89, not 189. I think I confused the hundreds digit counts earlier.\n\nWait, so let me redo the hundreds place:\n\n- Hundreds digit is 1: 1-99 (99 pages)\n- Hundreds digit is 2: 100-199 (100 pages)\n- Hundreds digit is 3: 200-299 (100 pages)\n- Hundreds digit is 4: 300-399 (100 pages) and 400-488 (89 pages). Wait, no, 300-399 is hundreds digit 3, and 400-488 is hundreds digit 4. So, 400-488 is 89 pages where hundreds digit is 4.\n\nSo, the total number of pages where hundreds digit is 4 is 89. Therefore, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so hundreds digit is always 1,2,3, or 4. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, correcting the earlier mistake, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours and 0 eights.\n\nNow, let's recalculate the total counts.\n\nFor 4:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = Let's compute: 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nFor 8:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that's different from my initial calculation. So, I must have made a mistake in the hundreds place earlier. So, the correct difference is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, let me go through the hundreds place again to make sure.\n\nFrom page 1 to 488:\n\n- Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 or 1? Wait, actually, page 1 is 1, which is a one-digit number, so hundreds digit is 0. Pages 1-99 have hundreds digit 0, except for pages 1-9, which are one-digit, so hundreds digit is 0. Pages 10-99 have tens digit, but hundreds digit is still 0. So, the hundreds digit is 1 starting from page 100.\n\nWait, no, actually, in page numbers, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488, which is 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, the total 4's are:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nAnd 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the hundreds digit for 4 was 189, which was incorrect. So, the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. From 401-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, but does 480-488 have 9 pages? Let me count: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages. So, 9 eights in the tens place in the partial hundred.\n\nSimilarly, the fours in the tens place in the partial hundred: 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, 10 fours.\n\nSo, tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 = 50 fours.\n\nFor eights: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 = 49 eights.\n\nUnits place: 49 each.\n\nHundreds place: 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct now.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 488 pages would have hundreds digit 4 from 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, 89 fours in hundreds place.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can write a small program or use another method to verify, but since I'm doing this manually, let me try another approach.\n\nAlternative approach: For each digit place, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\nTotal numbers: 488.\n\nNumber of times a digit appears in units place: For each digit d, it appears floor(488/10) + (1 if the last partial ten includes d else 0).\n\nSo, floor(488/10) = 48. The last partial ten is 481-488, which includes 4 and 8. So, 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of times a digit appears in tens place: For each digit d, it appears floor(488/100) * 10 + (min(10, 488 % 100 + 1) if the tens digit in the partial hundred is >= d else 0).\n\nWait, maybe that's too formulaic. Alternatively, the number of times a digit d appears in the tens place is:\n\nFor each hundred block, the digit d appears 10 times in the tens place. The number of complete hundreds is 4 (since 4*100=400). So, 4*10=40 times for each digit in the tens place.\n\nThen, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, for digit 4 in the tens place, it appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages. For digit 8, it appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages.\n\nSo, total for 4 in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nTotal for 8 in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nAs before, 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nI think I made a mistake earlier by miscalculating the hundreds place, but now it's corrected. So, the correct answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting '4's and '8's in Each Digit Place:**\n\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears once every 10 pages.\n     - Total complete tens in 488 pages: 48 (480 pages).\n     - Each contributes 1 '4' and 1 '8' in the units place: 48 each.\n     - Remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, adding 1 '4' (484) and 1 '8' (488).\n     - Total '4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n     - Total '8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - Each digit appears 10 times per hundred.\n     - Complete hundreds: 4 (400 pages), contributing 10 '4's and 10 '8's each: 40 each.\n     - Partial hundred (401-488): Tens digit '4' appears in 440-449 (10 times).\n                               Tens digit '8' appears in 480-488 (9 times).\n     - Total '4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n     - Total '8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - '4' appears in 400-488 (89 pages), contributing 89 '4's.\n     - '8' never appears in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n     - Total '4's in hundreds place: 89.\n     - Total '8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\n2. **Summing Up the Counts:**\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe digit '4' is printed 90 times more than the digit '8' in the page numbers of the book.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of 4's in the units place would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so that means there are 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 4, and then an extra 8 pages. So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 times. But wait, let me check: from 1 to 480, that's 48 blocks of 10, so 48 times. Then from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so no additional 4's there. So, units place: 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place**: The digit 4 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range x40 to x49 for each hundred. So, for each hundred, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many hundreds do we have? From 1 to 488, that's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each of the first four hundreds, there are 10 4's in the tens place. So that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for the numbers 440-449. That's another 10 numbers, so 10 more 4's. So, total in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. So, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times. But wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for 100 numbers (400-499), but since we only go up to 488, it's 89 numbers. So, hundreds place: 89 times.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 4's.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nAgain, checking each digit place:\n\n1. **Units place**: The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers, just like 4. So, from 1 to 488, how many 8's in the units place? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go up to 8, so that's another 8 in 488. So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, let me think again. From 1 to 480, that's 48 blocks of 10, so 48 8's. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place**: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges x80 to x89 for each hundred. So, in each hundred, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many hundreds do we have? From 1-488, that's 4 full hundreds and 88 more pages. So, in each of the first four hundreds, there are 10 8's in the tens place: 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for numbers 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800 to 899. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. Therefore, hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, let me check that again: units place is 49, tens place is 49, so total 98 8's.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 times. That seems right because from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 times.\n\n- Tens place: For each hundred, 10 times, so 4 hundreds give 40, plus in 401-488, 440-449 is 10, so total 50. That's correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49 times. From 1-480, 48 times, and 488 adds one more, so 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 4 hundreds give 40, and in 401-488, 480-488 gives 9, so 49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't count any overlaps or miss any numbers. For example, in the tens place for 4's, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. Similarly, for 8's, in the tens place, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nAnother way to check: Let's count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 187\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 98\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, this happens 48 times (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, taking the integer part).\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 4 full hundreds contributing 40, plus 10 more in 440-449, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (48 from 1-480, plus one in 488).\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred, plus 9 more in 480-488, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** There are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488, and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering how digits are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488, which is a three-digit number. So, I'll need to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nI remember that for counting digits in a range, it's helpful to look at each position (units, tens, hundreds) individually and calculate how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nStarting with the digit 4, let's first count how many times it appears in the units place. For the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 10, 4 appears once in the units place (page 4). From 11 to 20, it's page 14, and so on. So, in each block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, 4 appears in a block of 10 numbers every 100 numbers. For example, from 40 to 49, each number has a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 times. Similarly, from 140 to 149, another 10 times, and so on.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place, 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but I should check if 488 is included. Yes, 488 is page 488, so the hundreds digit is 4, so it's included.\n\nNow, let's compute the total number of 4's.\n\nFirst, units place: From 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing 1 four in the units place. So, 48 fours. But wait, in the last partial block from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. So, total units place fours are 48.\n\nWait, but actually, 488 is the last page, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning 48 full tens and a partial. So, 48 fours in units place.\n\nNext, tens place: For the tens place, 4 appears in blocks of 100. In each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Wait, but 400-488 is part of the 400s, so that's another hundred, but only up to 488.\n\nWait, actually, the hundreds can be considered as 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488.\n\nSo, in each hundred except the last, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, in 0-99: 10 fours in tens place, 100-199: 10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10. That's 40 fours. Now, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, 410-419, etc., but wait, 400-488: the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, 480-488. Wait, but in each of these, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, except maybe the last one.\n\nWait, actually, from 400-488, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? Let's see, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488: the tens digit is 8, not 4. So, actually, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only up to 479. So, from 400-479, how many tens digits of 4? Each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4, so from 400-479, that's 8 times (since 400-479 is 80 numbers, so 8 blocks of 10). So, 8 times 10, which is 80 fours in the tens place for 400-479. But wait, that's not right because each block of 10 contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, from 400-479, that's 8 blocks of 10 (400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479), each contributing 10 fours, so 8*10=80 fours in the tens place. Then, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8, so no fours there. So, total tens place fours are 40 (from the first four hundreds) plus 80 (from 400-479), totaling 120 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, but wait, I think I made a mistake here. Because in the first four hundreds (0-399), each contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 400-479, which is 80 numbers, so 8 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 fours, so 8*10=80. So, total tens place fours: 40 + 80 = 120.\n\nNow, hundreds place: As I thought earlier, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total fours: units (48) + tens (120) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 120 = 168 + 89 = 257 fours.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units: 48, tens: 120, hundreds:89. So, 48+120=168, plus 89 is 257. Okay.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with units place: How many times does 8 appear in the units place from 1 to 488? Similar to 4, it's once every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8. So, 48 eights in the units place. Now, in the last partial block, 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's an extra one. So, total units place eights: 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 1 to 480, there are 480 numbers, which is 48 blocks of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 eights. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once more (at 488). So, total units eights: 48 +1=49.\n\nNext, tens place: How many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Similar to fours, in each block of 100, 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, how many hundreds are there? Up to 488, so 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 400-488.\n\nIn each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times, so 4*10=40 eights in the tens place from 0-399.\n\nNow, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nSo, total tens place eights: 40 +9=49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: When does 8 appear in the hundreds place? That would be from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, 40 (from first four hundreds) +9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total eights: 49+49=98.\n\nNow, the number of fours is 257, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 257 -98=159.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, for fours:\n\nUnits place: 488 /10=48.8, so 48 fours, but wait, 488 is included, so in the units place, from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see: 4,14,24,...,484. So, the last one is 484, which is 484-4=480, divided by 10 is 48, so 48 fours in units place. So, 48.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 hundreds (0-399) contribute 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 400-479, which is 80 numbers, so 8 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 fours, so 8*10=80. So, total tens place fours: 40+80=120.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours: 48+120+89=257.\n\nFor eights:\n\nUnits place: From 1-488, 488/10=48.8, so 48 eights, plus one more at 488, so 49.\n\nTens place: From 0-399, 4*10=40 eights. From 400-488, tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal eights: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 257-98=159.\n\nWait, but I feel like that's a big number. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Let me check again.\n\nFrom 400-488, how many numbers? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but when counting the tens place for fours, I considered 400-479 as 80 numbers, which is 8 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 fours. So, 8*10=80. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place in eights, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights.\n\nHmm, maybe the difference is indeed 159. Let me try a different approach to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of fours and eights in each digit place separately.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nNumber of fours: floor(488/10)=48, since 488/10=48.8, so 48 fours.\n\nNumber of eights: same, 48 eights, plus one more at 488, so 49.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\nNumber of fours: In each hundred, 10 fours in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (0-399) contribute 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 400-479, which is 80 numbers, so 8*10=80. So, total tens place fours: 40+80=120.\n\nNumber of eights: In each hundred, 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 40+9=49.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\nNumber of fours: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nNumber of eights: 0, since 800 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, total fours: 48 (units) +120 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=257.\n\nTotal eights:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:257-98=159.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 159 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 257, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 257 - 98 = 159.\n\n$\\boxed{159}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should understand how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. That means the page numbers will be from 1 up to 488, so the last few pages will be three-digit numbers starting with 4, like 480, 481, and so on up to 488.\n\nNow, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll count the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each place and then add them up.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place.\n   - How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, we'll consider 48 full blocks and then the remaining 8 pages.\n   - So, in 48 full blocks, the digit 4 appears 48 times in the units place.\n   - Now, in the remaining 8 pages (from 481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. The digit 4 appears once here (at 484).\n   - Therefore, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Similarly, every 100 pages, the tens digit cycles through 0 to 9 ten times each. So, in each block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n   - How many full hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so we have 4 full hundreds and an additional 88 pages.\n   - In each of the 4 full hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n   - Now, in the remaining 88 pages (from 401 to 488), we need to check how many times 4 appears in the tens place.\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100, so in 88 pages, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 in the 400s. So, the digit 4 appears once in the tens place from 440 to 449, which is 10 times.\n   - Wait, but 440 to 449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, in the remaining 88 pages, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n   - Therefore, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (including both 400 and 488).\n   - So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Okay, that seems right.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - As before, every 10 pages, the units digit cycles. So, in each block of 10, 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 full blocks of 10 in 488 pages, giving 48 occurrences.\n   - In the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once here (at 488).\n   - So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 pages, the tens digit cycles. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n   - There are 4 full hundreds in 488 pages, so 4 blocks of 100. Each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 8 appears once from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 pages (480-488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but we only have up to 488, so it's 9 pages. But actually, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but in terms of the tens place, each 10 numbers have the same tens digit. So, in the 480-489 range, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers. Hmm, but actually, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, which is 10 numbers, but since we stop at 488, we have 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Wait, no, actually, 480 is the first number with tens digit 8, and 488 is the last. So, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Therefore, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times, not 10. Wait, but that might not be correct because 480 is included in the 488 pages, so how many times does 8 appear in the tens place beyond the 400s?\n\nWait, let me think again. The remaining 88 pages are from 401 to 488. So, the tens digit cycles from 0 (400-409) to 8 (480-488). So, in the 400s, the tens digit 8 appears from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers. Therefore, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in the remaining 88 pages.\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place: 40 (from the full hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 10, but now I'm getting 9. Let me confirm. From 400 to 488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481,...,488). So, 9 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never is 8. Therefore, 0 occurrences.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the tens place, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 40 from the full hundreds plus 9 gives 49 in the tens place. Units place is 49, so total 8's is 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Every 10 numbers, so 48 full tens (1-480) give 48 eights, and then from 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, so that's one more 8. So, 48 + 1 = 49, correct.\n\nIn the tens place, from 1-400, the tens digit 8 appears in each hundred block, so 10 times per hundred, so 4 times 10 is 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place, as I thought earlier, there are no 8's because the book ends at 488, so hundreds digit never reaches 8.\n\nSo, total 8's: 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's was 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me see if I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, in the 4's count, in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. Then, in the tens place, I had 50, and units place 49, totaling 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds: 0, totaling 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I feel like that might be too high. Let me check another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about each digit place separately and recount.\n\n**Rechecking 4's:**\n\n- Units place: From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units digit?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, total number of 10s in 488 is 48 full tens (1-480) and 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, 48 + 1 (since 484 is in the extra 8) = 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: How many times does 4 appear in the tens digit?\n\nIn each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 4 full hundreds (1-400), so 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Correct.\n\n**Rechecking 8's:**\n\n- Units place: Every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. 48 full tens (1-480) give 48, plus 488, so 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: In each hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). 4 full hundreds give 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nIn the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 times. Thus, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, as before.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit surprised because I thought maybe the 4's would be more, but 90 seems a bit high. Let me see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place more carefully.\n\nAnother approach is to consider each digit place separately and calculate the number of times each digit appears.\n\n**Calculating 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - For each group of 10 numbers, 4 appears once.\n   - Number of complete groups of 10 in 488: floor(488 / 10) = 48.\n   - So, 48 times in the units place.\n   - Now, the remaining numbers are 488 - (48 * 10) = 488 - 480 = 8 numbers: 481-488.\n   - In these, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (at 484).\n   - Total units: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - For each group of 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each.\n   - So, in each 100, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n   - Number of complete hundreds in 488: floor(488 / 100) = 4.\n   - So, 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n   - Now, the remaining numbers are 488 - (4 * 100) = 88 numbers: 401-488.\n   - In these 88 numbers, the tens digit cycles 0-8 in the 400s.\n   - The tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers.\n   - So, 40 + 10 = 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - So, 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Calculating 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Same as above: floor(488 / 10) = 48 groups, each contributing 1, so 48.\n   - Remaining 8 numbers: 481-488, where 8 appears once (at 488).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each 100 numbers, 10 times in the tens place.\n   - 4 full hundreds: 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - Remaining 88 numbers: 401-488.\n   - The tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488).\n   - So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - As before, 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot, but maybe that's correct. Let me think of a smaller example to test my method.\n\nSuppose we have a 20-page book. How many more 4's than 8's?\n\nPage numbers 1-20.\n\nCounting 4's:\n- Units: 4,14 \u2192 2\n- Tens: 40-49, but we only go up to 20, so 0.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal 4's: 2.\n\nCounting 8's:\n- Units: 8,18 \u2192 2\n- Tens: 80-89, but we only go up to 20, so 0.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal 8's: 2.\n\nDifference: 2 - 2 = 0. So, correct.\n\nAnother example: 100 pages.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n- Units: 10 (4,14,...,94)\n- Tens: 10 (40-49)\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 20.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n- Units: 10 (8,18,...,98)\n- Tens: 10 (80-89)\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 20.\n\nDifference: 0. Correct.\n\nAnother example: 140 pages.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n- Units: 14 (4,14,...,134)\n- Tens: 10 (40-49) + 10 (140-149) \u2192 but wait, up to 140, so 40-49 and 140-149. But 140-149 is 10 numbers, but 140 is included, so in 140 pages, 40-49 and 140-149 are both included, so 10 + 10 = 20.\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 14 + 20 = 34.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n- Units: 14 (8,18,...,138)\n- Tens: 10 (80-89) + 10 (180-189, but up to 140, so only 80-89)\nWait, up to 140, so in tens place, only 80-89 is within 140, so 10 times.\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 14 + 10 = 24.\n\nDifference: 34 - 24 = 10.\n\nWait, let me count manually. From 1-140:\n\n4's:\n- Units: 4,14,24,...,134 \u2192 14 numbers\n- Tens: 40-49 (10) and 140-149, but 140 is included, so 10 more \u2192 total 20\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 14 + 20 = 34.\n\n8's:\n- Units: 8,18,...,138 \u2192 14 numbers\n- Tens: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 14 + 10 = 24.\n\nDifference: 34 - 24 = 10. So, correct.\n\nSo, my method seems to work on smaller numbers, so I think it's correct for 488 pages.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is calculated by examining each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately. Similarly, the number of times the digit 8 appears is calculated. The difference between these counts gives the result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. In 488 pages, there are 48 full decades (1-480) and 8 extra pages (481-488). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times in each hundred (e.g., 40-49). In 488 pages, there are 4 full hundreds, contributing 40, plus 10 more in 440-449, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. In 488 pages, 48 full decades plus 1 in 488, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears 10 times in each hundred. In 488 pages, 4 full hundreds contribute 40, plus 9 times in 480-488, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in 488 pages.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
