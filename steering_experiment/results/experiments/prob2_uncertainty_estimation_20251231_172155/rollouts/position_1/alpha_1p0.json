    "text": " I'm not sure if I'm overcomplicating it, but I think I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Maybe I should start by counting how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and then do the same for 8. After that, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nFirst, let me think about the units place. For every 10 pages, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 pages, the digit 4 appears exactly once, right? For example, pages 4, 14, 24, and so on. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once every 10 pages as well, like pages 8, 18, 28, etc.\n\nSo, how many complete sets of 10 pages are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra pages. In each of those 48 sets, the digit 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. But wait, the last 8 pages are from 481 to 488. Let me check if any of those pages have a 4 in the units place. Page 484 would have a 4 in the units place, so that's one more. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, each set of 10 pages has one 8, so 48 times. Now, the last 8 pages are 481 to 488. Page 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So, total 8's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49 as well. Wait, that can't be right because the problem says 4's are more than 8's. Maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, no, let me check again. From 1 to 488, each 10 pages have one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 complete sets give 48 each, and then the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So, 48 + 1 = 49 for 4's, and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8's. Hmm, so they're equal in the units place. That's interesting. So, maybe the difference comes from the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The digit in the tens place changes every 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. Wait, no, actually, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (pages 1-9) to 9 (pages 91-100). So, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8.\n\nSo, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? There are four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, no, 488 is less than 500, so it's four full hundreds (1-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nSo, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8. So, for four hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place. Now, let's check the last 88 pages (401-488). In this range, the tens digit cycles from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490), but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit goes up to 8 but only 8 times (481-488). So, does the digit 4 appear in the tens place in 401-488? Yes, pages 440-449 have a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 pages, so 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 pages (480-488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 times. So, in the tens place, 4's appear 10 times (from 440-449), and 8's appear 9 times (from 480-488).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought each hundred had 10 times, so for four hundreds, 40 times each. But in the last partial hundred (401-488), 4's add 10 more, making total 50 for 4's, and 8's add 9 more, making total 49 for 8's. Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake. Each full hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for four full hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 for 4's and 40 for 8's. Then, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. Let's see, the 4 in the tens place occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 more 4's. The 8 in the tens place occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 more 8's. Therefore, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. Total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, so that's 50 4's and 49 8's in the tens place. So, 4's are one more than 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, for each hundred, the hundreds digit is the same for all pages in that hundred. So, pages 1-99 have hundreds digit 0 (if we consider three-digit numbers, but actually, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99). Pages 100-199 have hundreds digit 1, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive). So, 89 times. How about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit can't be 8 because the book only has 488 pages, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, total 4's in hundreds place: 89, and 8's: 0.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, in the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times, and 8's don't appear at all.\n\nNow, let me sum up the totals:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- Each 10 pages have one 4 and one 8.\n- 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each.\n- The remaining 8 pages (481-488) have one 4 (484) and one 8 (488), so total 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n- Four full hundreds: 4 * 10 = 40 each.\n- Last 88 pages (401-488):\n  - 440-449: 10 pages with 4 in tens place.\n  - 480-488: 9 pages with 8 in tens place.\n- So, 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\nThat adds up.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 400-488: 89 pages with 4 in hundreds place.\n- 8 never appears in hundreds place.\nSo, 4's: 89, 8's: 0.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me check how many pages are from 400 to 488. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. That's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about the hundreds place: For each hundred, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 4 appears in the hundreds place only in the last hundred, which is 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, 89 times.\n\nWait, but let me think about the hundreds digit for each page. Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's. Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's. Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, same thing. Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3. Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4. So, 4's in hundreds place: 89, and 8's: 0.\n\nSo, yeah, 89 4's in hundreds place, 0 8's.\n\nNow, let me check the tens place again. In the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, it's from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 4's. For 8 in the tens place, it's from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 8's.\n\nSo, adding to the four full hundreds, which gave 40 each, we have 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's in tens place, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's in tens place.\n\nUnits place: 49 each.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, but the problem says \"how many more 4's are printed than 8's.\" So, the answer would be 90 more 4's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count anything. Each digit is considered in units, tens, and hundreds separately, so I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. Let's calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place.\n\nUnits place:\n- For 4's: number of times 4 appears in units place from 1 to 488.\n- Every 10 pages, 4 appears once, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48.\n- Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) include 484, which is another 4, so total 49.\n- Similarly, for 8's: 48 full cycles (48) plus 488, so 49.\n\nTens place:\n- For 4's: each hundred has 10 pages where tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n- There are four full hundreds (1-400), so 4 * 10 = 40.\n- Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 more, totaling 50.\n- For 8's: each hundred has 10 pages where tens digit is 8 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4 * 10 = 40.\n- In 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488), so 9 more, totaling 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n- For 4's: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n- For 8's: no pages have 8 in the hundreds place, so 0.\n\nAdding up:\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nI think that's correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **4's:** Each 10 pages contain one 4. There are 48 full sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48. The last 8 pages (481-488) include 484, adding 1 more. Total: 49.\n   - **8's:** Similarly, each 10 pages contain one 8. The last page 488 adds another. Total: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - **4's:** Each hundred has 10 pages with 4 in the tens place. Four full hundreds contribute 40. The last 88 pages (401-488) add 10 (440-449). Total: 50.\n   - **8's:** Each hundred contributes 10. The last 88 pages add 9 (480-488). Total: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **4's:** Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89.\n   - **8's:** No pages have 8 in the hundreds place. Total: 0.\n\nSumming up:\n- **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by understanding how page numbers are structured and then count the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\nFirst, I think I should consider each digit place separately: the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place. That way, I can count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each position and then sum them up. But wait, the book only has 488 pages, so the hundreds place can only be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since page numbers start at 1, the first page is 1, and the last is 488. So the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. But wait, for pages 1-9, the hundreds digit is 0, right? So maybe I should handle each digit place separately.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each block of 10 pages. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So each digit appears once in the units place every 10 pages. So in 488 pages, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks of 10 pages and then 8 extra pages. So in each complete block, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 appears once as well. So for 48 blocks, that's 48 times each. But then we have 8 extra pages: 481 to 488. So in the units place, the digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So 4 appears once and 8 appears once in the units place of the extra pages. So total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4's, and 48 +1=49 for 8's. Hmm, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check that. From 1 to 480, that's 48 blocks of 10, so 48 times each. Then from 481 to 488, which is 8 pages, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 and 8 each appear once. So yes, total units: 49 each.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 pages. So in 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). So in each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly for 8 (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So for each hundred, 10 times each digit. So 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. The tens digits in 401-488 go from 0 to 8. So for 4 in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488, right? So 4 appears 10 times in the tens place here. Similarly, 8 in the tens place is 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488), so the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages. Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 pages, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 pages. So in the tens place, in the last 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. Pages 401-488: the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many pages? Each tens digit has 10 pages except the last one, which is 480-488, which is 9 pages because 488 is the last page. So in the tens place, for 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. For 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times.\n\nSo total in the tens place: 4 appears 40 (from the 4 hundreds) +10=50 times, and 8 appears 40 +9=49 times. So in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nWait, but wait, let me think again. From 1-400, it's 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 times for each digit in the tens place, so 4*10=40 for 4 and 40 for 8. Then from 401-488, which is 88 pages, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except the last one which is 9 times. So in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages. So yes, 10 and 9 respectively. So total in the tens place: 40+10=50 for 4, and 40+9=49 for 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place?\n\nFor 0: pages 1-99, so 99 pages, but the hundreds digit is 0, so 0 appears 99 times? Wait, no, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, but each page number is a three-digit number with leading zeros, so 01, 02, etc. But actually, page numbers don't have leading zeros; they are just 1, 2, ..., 99. So the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, but in reality, the hundreds digit isn't printed for those pages because they are one or two-digit numbers. Wait, but the problem says each page is printed once, so page 1 is just '1', page 10 is '10', etc. So the hundreds digit is only present when the page number is 100 or above. So in the hundreds place, the digit 0 doesn't appear because page numbers don't have leading zeros. So the hundreds digit is only present for pages 100-488.\n\nSo, for the hundreds place:\n\n- 1 appears from 100-199: 100 pages, so 100 times.\n- 2 appears from 200-299: 100 pages, so 100 times.\n- 3 appears from 300-399: 100 pages, so 100 times.\n- 4 appears from 400-488: 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). Wait, 400 to 488 inclusive is 89 pages. So the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n\nSo in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. The hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488, which is 89 pages. So 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place anywhere because the highest page is 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8.\n\nSo now, let's sum up the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each place.\n\nFirst, for 4:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\n\nTotal for 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nFor 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\n\nTotal for 8: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nSo the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because 488 pages, and I'm counting each digit place separately. Did I make a mistake in any of the counts?\n\nLet me go through each place again.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Every 10 pages, so 48 full decades (480 pages) give 48 times, and then from 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so 4 appears once. So total 49.\n\nSimilarly for 8: same as 4, 49 times.\n\nTens place:\n\nFrom 1-400: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place. So 40 each.\n\nFrom 401-488: tens digits go from 0 to 8. For 4 in tens place: 440-449, which is 10 pages. For 8 in tens place: 480-488, which is 9 pages.\n\nSo total for 4: 40 +10=50, and for 8:40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 doesn't appear.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 in each of those. So that's 89 times. So that's correct.\n\nAnother way to check: total number of digits printed. Each page from 1-9 has 1 digit, 10-99 has 2 digits, 100-488 has 3 digits.\n\nTotal digits:\n\n1-9:9 pages, 1 digit each:9 digits.\n\n10-99:90 pages, 2 digits each:180 digits.\n\n100-488:389 pages, 3 digits each:1167 digits.\n\nTotal digits:9 +180 +1167=1356 digits.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98. So total digits accounted for by 4's and 8's:188 +98=286. That seems plausible because 286 is less than 1356, so it's possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each place again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the tens place for 8. Let me check the tens digit from 401-488 again.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear?\n\n- 0: 10 pages (401-410)\n- 1:10 pages (411-420)\n- 2:10 pages (421-430)\n- 3:10 pages (431-440)\n- 4:10 pages (441-450)\n- 5:10 pages (451-460)\n- 6:10 pages (461-470)\n- 7:10 pages (471-480)\n- 8:9 pages (481-488)\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 pages because 488 is the last page. So the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place from 480-488.\n\nSo in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in the last partial hundred. So total tens place 8's:40 (from 1-400) +9=49.\n\nSimilarly, 4 in the tens place from 401-488 is 10 times (440-449). So total 4's in tens place:40 +10=50.\n\nSo yes, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way: Let's count the number of 4's and 8's in each position.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 4 appears once every 10 pages, so in 488 pages, how many times? 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full times, and then in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), 4 appears once. So total 49.\n\nSame for 8:49.\n\nTens place:\n\n- 4 appears 10 times every 100 pages. So in 488 pages, how many hundreds? 4 full hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10 times, so 40. Then in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), 4 appears in the tens place from 440-449, which is 10 pages. So total 50.\n\n- 8 appears 10 times every 100 pages, so 40 times in 1-400. In 401-488, 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 pages. So total 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct. So the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by considering how page numbers are structured. Page numbers go from 1 to 488, so each page number is a one, two, three, or four-digit number. I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nFirst, I should probably consider each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds, and maybe even thousands, although 488 is less than 1000, so the thousands place would only be relevant if the number was 1000 or more. Wait, no, 488 is a three-digit number, so the thousands place isn't used. So, I'll focus on units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's in each place.\n\n1. Units place: The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So in 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, for every 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once. So, how many such groups are there in 488 numbers? That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a group, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, that would give us 48 times, but actually, the last group might be incomplete. Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48 full groups and 8 remaining numbers. So, in each full group, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so 4 appears once per group. So, 48 times. But then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more in 484. So total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but actually, when I divide 488 by 10, I get 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then the 49th group is 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the units digits go up to 8. So in that partial group, 484 is the only number with a 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, the digit 4 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, in 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, in 140-149, 240-249, etc. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 numbers?\n\nLet me calculate how many complete hundreds are there. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these blocks has a 40-49 section, which is 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 4 blocks x 10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, what about the remaining 88 numbers (401-488)? In this range, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 in the 400s. So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 occurrences. Therefore, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So yes, that's 10 more. So total 50.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for numbers 400-499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 times.\n\nWait, but 400 is the first number with 4 in the hundreds place, and 488 is the last. So, yes, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188.\n\nWait, let me check that addition again: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Yes, that seems right.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. Units place: Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, in 488 numbers, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block is 10 numbers. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 numbers?\n\n488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds. Each hundred has one block of 80-89, so 4 blocks x 10 = 40 occurrences.\n\nNow, the remaining 88 numbers (401-488). In this range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480-488. Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but we're stopping at 488, so it's 9 numbers. Wait, but 480 is included, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 in 9 numbers here. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. In 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 in the 400s. So, 480-489 would be the tens digit 8, but since we stop at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 occurrences.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is 188, and number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 is correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place of 4's, I had 40 from the first four hundreds, and then 10 from 440-449, which is correct because 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 more.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 48 full groups, plus one in the last partial group, so 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, units place: 48 full groups, plus one in the last partial group (488), so 49.\n\nTens place for 8's: 40 from the first four hundreds, plus 9 from 480-488, so 49.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 4's again. From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. Wait, but earlier I thought there were four complete hundreds, each contributing one block of 10. Wait, no, each hundred has one block where the tens digit is 4, so from 0-99: 40-49, 100-199: 140-149, 200-299: 240-249, 300-399: 340-349, and 400-488: 440-449. So that's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 4 blocks, but actually, it's 5 blocks because 400-488 includes another block (440-449). So, that would make the tens place 4's as 50, which I had earlier.\n\nWait, but when I divided 488 by 100, I got 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, totaling 40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers, so 40 + 10 = 50. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, the first four hundreds contribute 40, and then in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, I think my counts are correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count any numbers or miss any edge cases. For example, in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct.\n\nIn the units place, for both 4 and 8, I correctly accounted for the last partial group.\n\nIn the tens place, I correctly considered the additional block in the 400s for 4's and the partial block for 8's.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct, and the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - 4 appears once every 10 numbers.  \n   - Total groups of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full groups (480 numbers) + 8 remaining numbers (481-488).  \n   - In each full group, 4 appears once in the units place: 48 times.  \n   - In the remaining 8 numbers, 484 has a 4 in the units place: 1 time.  \n   - **Total units place 4's:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each block of 100 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).  \n   - Number of complete hundreds in 488 pages: 4 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400).  \n   - Each contributes 10 4's: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.  \n   - In the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), 440-449 contributes another 10 4's.  \n   - **Total tens place 4's:** 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488.  \n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.  \n   - **Total hundreds place 4's:** 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 numbers.  \n   - 48 full groups of 10: 48 times.  \n   - In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 488 has an 8 in the units place: 1 time.  \n   - **Total units place 8's:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each block of 100 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).  \n   - Number of complete hundreds in 488 pages: 4, each contributing 10 8's: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.  \n   - In the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), 480-488 contributes 9 8's (since 480-488 is 9 numbers).  \n   - **Total tens place 8's:** 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - **Total hundreds place 8's:** 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Maybe I should start by understanding how page numbers are structured and where the digits 4 and 8 appear.\n\nFirst, I think I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the numbers can be one-digit (1-9), two-digit (10-99), three-digit (100-488). Maybe I should count the number of 4's and 8's in each place separately and then add them up.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For the units digit, every 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does each digit appear in the units place?\n\nWait, but the first page is 1, so actually from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, the number of times each digit appears in the units place is roughly the total number of pages divided by 10, right? But since 488 isn't a multiple of 10, I'll have to adjust for the last partial cycle.\n\nSo, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full cycles of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each full cycle, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in the units place. So, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 times 1 (from each cycle) plus any extra in the last partial cycle. Similarly for 8's.\n\nLooking at the last partial cycle, which is 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. So, same number so far.\n\nWait, but wait. The first page is 1, so from 1 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 9 in the first cycle, then 0 to 9 in each subsequent cycle. Wait, no, actually, page 1 is 1, so the first units digits are 1-9, then 0-9 for each subsequent ten. So, maybe I need to adjust for that first partial cycle.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each place.\n\nLet me think again. For the units place:\n\nTotal numbers = 488.\n\nEach digit from 0-9 appears equally in the units place, except possibly the last partial cycle.\n\nNumber of full cycles = 488 // 10 = 48 full cycles (each of 10 numbers), and the remaining 8 numbers (481-488).\n\nIn each full cycle, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. So, for 48 full cycles, each digit appears 48 times.\n\nNow, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, digit 4 appears once, and digit 8 appears once. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait, page 1 is 1, so the first units digit is 1, not 0. So, in the first cycle (1-10), the units digits are 1-0. So, in the first cycle, 0 appears once (at page 10), and digits 1-9 appear once each. So, for the units place, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 48 times in the full cycles, but in the first cycle, 0 appears once, and digits 1-9 appear once each. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe it's better to consider that in each set of 10 numbers, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place, but the first set (1-10) includes 0 at page 10, so from 1-488, the number of times each digit appears in the units place is 48 times for each digit, plus any in the remaining 8 numbers.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be. Let me try a different approach.\n\nTotal number of pages: 488.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of times each digit appears in units place = total numbers // 10 = 488 // 10 = 48. But since 488 is not a multiple of 10, we have 48 full tens and 8 extra numbers. So, each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place, plus in the last 8 numbers, digits 1-8 appear once each. So, for digit 4: 48 + 1 (from 484) = 49. For digit 8: 48 + 1 (from 488) = 49.\n\nWait, but wait, page 10 is included in the first full cycle, so 0 appears 48 times in the units place as well. So, yes, 0 appears 48 times, and digits 1-9 each appear 48 times, plus in the last 8 numbers, digits 1-8 appear once each. So, for 4 and 8, they each get an extra 1, making it 49 each.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears in blocks of 100. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. Wait, no, actually, from 0-99, each tens digit (0-9) appears 10 times each. Similarly, from 100-199, each tens digit appears 10 times, and so on.\n\nBut since we're only going up to 488, let's see:\n\nTotal number of hundreds: 4 (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n\nWait, but 400-488 is not a full hundred. So, for the tens place, let's calculate how many times each digit appears.\n\nEach hundred block (e.g., 100-199) has 10 occurrences of each tens digit (0-9). So, for each complete hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNumber of complete hundreds: 4 (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-499). Wait, but our book ends at 488, so the last hundred block is 400-488, which is 89 numbers, not 100. So, in the hundreds place, 400-488 is part of the 400s.\n\nWait, but for the tens place, in 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, in the tens place, each digit from 0-8 appears 9 times in 400-488? Wait, no, let me think carefully.\n\nFrom 400-409: tens digit is 0 (10 numbers).\n410-419: tens digit 1 (10 numbers).\n...\n480-488: tens digit 8 (9 numbers, since 488 is the end).\n\nSo, in the 400-488 range, the tens digits 0-7 each appear 10 times (for 400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n\nSo, for each complete hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each tens digit 0-9 appears 10 times. So, for 3 complete hundreds, that's 3*10=30 times each.\n\nNow, in the incomplete hundred block (400-488), as I thought, tens digits 0-7 appear 10 times each, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total for the tens place:\n\nFor digit 4: in each complete hundred, 10 times, so 3*10=30. In the incomplete hundred, does 4 appear in the tens place? Yes, in 440-449, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 times in the incomplete hundred.\n\nWait, but wait, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, in the incomplete hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place, in the incomplete hundred, it appears 9 times (480-488).\n\nSo, total for digit 4 in tens place: 30 (from complete hundreds) + 10 = 40.\n\nFor digit 8 in tens place: 30 (from complete hundreds) + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but wait, in the complete hundreds (100-399), each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place, so 3 hundreds would give 3*10=30 for each digit, including 8.\n\nIn the incomplete hundred (400-488), as I said, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place, so total for 8 in tens place: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nSimilarly, 4 appears 10 times in the incomplete hundred, so total 30 + 10 = 40.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check that. From 100-199, the tens digits go from 0-9 each 10 times. Same for 200-299 and 300-399. So, yes, each digit in the tens place appears 30 times in the first three hundreds.\n\nIn 400-488, the tens digits go from 0-8, with 0 appearing 10 times (400-409), 1 appearing 10 times (410-419), ..., 8 appearing 9 times (480-488). So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, yes, 40 times for 4, 39 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, each digit from 1-4 appears, since the book has 488 pages.\n\nFrom 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, but since we're only considering page numbers starting from 1, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, but we don't count leading zeros, so the hundreds digit doesn't appear at all for pages 1-99. So, the hundreds digit starts at page 100.\n\nFrom 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, appearing 100 times.\n\nFrom 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, appearing 100 times.\n\nFrom 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, appearing 100 times.\n\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times (since 488-400+1=89 pages).\n\nSo, for the hundreds place:\n\nDigit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nDigit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place because we don't have pages 800-899.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFor digit 4:\n\nUnits place: 49 times.\n\nTens place: 40 times.\n\nHundreds place: 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 40 + 89 = let's see, 49+40=89, 89+89=178.\n\nFor digit 8:\n\nUnits place: 49 times.\n\nTens place: 39 times.\n\nHundreds place: 0 times.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 39 + 0 = 88 times.\n\nWait, but wait, that can't be right because 49+39=88, yes.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 178, and the total number of 8's is 88.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 178 - 88 = 90.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place for the first 480 pages (48*10=480). Then, from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, 48+1=49 for both 4 and 8 in units place. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nFrom 1-99, each tens digit appears 10 times, but wait, actually, in the tens place, from 1-99, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, from 1-99, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, up to 9 for 90-99. So, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place from 1-99. Then, from 100-488, each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) has each tens digit appearing 10 times, so 3*10=30 for each digit. Then, in 400-488, as I calculated earlier, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times. So, for 4: 30 + 10 = 40. For 8: 30 +9=39. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 100-199: 1 appears 100 times.\n\n200-299: 2 appears 100 times.\n\n300-399: 3 appears 100 times.\n\n400-488: 4 appears 89 times.\n\nSo, 4 appears 89 times in hundreds place, 8 appears 0 times. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 178.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 39 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 88.\n\nDifference: 178 - 88 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I accounted correctly for the hundreds place in the units and tens digits. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, when I'm considering the hundreds digit, I'm only counting the leading digit, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for each hundred block, each digit appears 10 times, so 3*10=30 for each digit, including 8. Then, in the incomplete block (400-488), 8 appears 9 times in the tens place. So, 30+9=39 for 8 in tens place.\n\nSimilarly, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in the incomplete block, so 30+10=40 for 4 in tens place.\n\nUnits place: each digit appears 48 times in the first 480 pages, plus 1 time each in the last 8 pages for digits 1-8. So, 49 each for 4 and 8.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's: 49+40+89=178.\n\n8's: 49+39+0=88.\n\nDifference: 178-88=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place for the first 480 pages.\n   - In the remaining 8 pages (481-488), digits 1-8 each appear once.\n   - **4's:** 48 + 1 = 49\n   - **8's:** 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times per hundred block (e.g., 100-199).\n   - For the first three complete hundreds (100-399), each digit appears 30 times.\n   - In the incomplete hundred (400-488):\n     - 4 appears 10 times (440-449).\n     - 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - **4's:** 30 + 10 = 40\n   - **8's:** 30 + 9 = 39\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - **4's:** 89\n   - **8's:** 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 178\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 39 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 88\n\n**Difference:** 178 - 88 = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by understanding how page numbers are structured and then count the occurrences of 4's and 8's separately.\n\nFirst, page numbers go from 1 to 488. Each page number is printed once, so I need to look at each digit in these numbers and count how many times 4 appears and how many times 8 appears. Then, I can subtract the count of 8's from the count of 4's to find the difference.\n\nI think it's best to approach this by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Since 488 is a three-digit number, we have hundreds, tens, and units places. Let me start with the units place because that might be simpler.\n\n**Counting 4's in the units place:**\nFor the units digit, 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 complete sets. Each set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 fours. But wait, the last set is from 481 to 490, but our book ends at 488, so the 48th set goes up to 480. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which adds another 4 in the units place. So actually, it's 48 + 1 = 49 fours in the units place.\n\nWait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. Each complete set of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So from 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48 fours. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1 through 8, so 484 is the only number with a 4 in the units place. So that's 48 + 1 = 49 fours in the units place.\n\n**Counting 8's in the units place:**\nSimilarly, for the units digit, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many 8's are there? Using the same logic, there are 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48 eights. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which adds another 8 in the units place. So that's 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so that's correct. So both 4's and 8's have 49 occurrences in the units place. Hmm, that's interesting. So the units place contributes equally to both counts.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\n**Counting 4's in the tens place:**\nIn the tens place, 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. So each 100 numbers have 10 fours in the tens place. Let me see how many such blocks are in 488.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many complete hundreds are there? Well, 400 is the start of the fourth hundred. So from 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. So in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So that's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 401-488 is only 88 numbers, but the tens digit cycles every 10. So from 401-410, the tens digit is 0, 411-420 is 1, and so on up to 480-489, which would be 8 in the tens place. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we stop at 488, the tens digit 8 is present from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear?\n\nWait, let me correct that. The tens digit is 4 in the block 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, no, because 440-449 is within 488, right? So each of these blocks contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So how many such blocks are there?\n\nFrom 1-488, the blocks where the tens digit is 4 are:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 4 blocks, but now I'm seeing 5 blocks. Let me check: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks, each with 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So that's 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So 50 fours in the tens place.\n\n**Counting 8's in the tens place:**\nSimilarly, for the tens digit being 8, we have blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them.\n\nSo how many complete blocks are there?\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers\n\nWait, but each block before 480 is 10 numbers, so 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 eights. Then, the last block from 480-488 contributes 9 eights in the tens place, since 488 is the last page. So total eights in the tens place would be 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 eights. So total eights in the tens place: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is another 10, 380-389 is another 10, and 480-488 is 9. So that's 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nSo far, in the units and tens places, 4's have 49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99 fours, and 8's have 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98 eights. Hmm, so 99 - 98 = 1 more four so far. But I also need to check the hundreds place.\n\n**Counting 4's in the hundreds place:**\nThe hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, contributing 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\n**Counting 8's in the hundreds place:**\nThe hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800 to 899, but our book ends at 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So the count for 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nNow, let's add up all the counts.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big difference. Did I count correctly?\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 49 fours and 49 eights. In the tens place, I had 50 fours and 49 eights. In the hundreds place, 89 fours and 0 eights.\n\nSo total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 4's. I considered five blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these has 10 numbers, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, I had four complete blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each with 10 eights, and then 480-488, which is 9 eights. So 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times because from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. 8's don't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so no 800-899 pages.\n\nSo adding up, fours are 188, eights are 98. The difference is indeed 90.\n\nWait, but I feel like that's a lot. Let me check if I didn't overcount in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: for each page number, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, which is correct.\n\nSo I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, the number of fours printed is 90 more than the number of eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits '4' and '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding how many more '4's are printed than '8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting '4's:**\n   - **Units Place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets of 10, contributing 48 fours. Additionally, 484 adds one more, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** '4' appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10 fours. There are 5 such blocks (including 440-449), totaling 50 fours.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, '4' appears in the hundreds place for 89 numbers.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting '8's:**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to '4's, '8' appears 49 times.\n   - **Tens Place:** '8' appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488 contributing 9. Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No '8's appear here.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Because the number of times a digit appears can vary depending on its position. For example, the digit 4 might appear more often in the units place than in the tens place, and maybe even more in the hundreds place if the book had more than 400 pages. But since it's 488 pages, the hundreds place only goes up to 4, right?\n\nWait, no, actually, 488 is the last page, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4, but the tens and units digits go up to 8. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that affects the count of 4's and 8's. Maybe I should approach this by looking at each digit place one by one.\n\nLet me start with the units place. In the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often every 10 pages. So, from page 1 to page 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 pages and then 8 extra pages. \n\nIn each complete set of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears once. So, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 times 1, which is 48, and the number of 8's is also 48. But wait, there are 8 extra pages beyond the 480th page, which are pages 481 to 488. In these 8 pages, the units digits are 1 through 8. So, the digit 4 appears once more in the units place (page 484), and the digit 8 appears once more (page 488). \n\nSo, for the units place, total 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49, and total 8's would be 48 + 1 = 49. So, they're equal in the units place. Hmm, interesting.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, from page 1 to 400, each digit appears 40 times in the tens place (since 400 divided by 100 is 4, and each hundred contributes 10 times each digit). Wait, no, actually, each hundred block (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has each digit appearing 10 times in the tens place. So, for 400 pages, that's 4 hundreds, so 4 times 10, which is 40 times each digit. \n\nBut since we're going up to 488, which is 488 pages, that's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn the tens place, for each full hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and the digit 8 appears 10 times as well (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, in the first 400 pages, the digit 4 appears 4*10 = 40 times in the tens place, and the same for 8. \n\nNow, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), let's see how the tens digit behaves. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, from 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, it's 1; and so on up to 481-490. But wait, our book stops at 488, so the last partial set is 481-488, which is 8 pages. \n\nIn the tens place for these 88 pages, how many times does 4 and 8 appear? Let's see: \n\n- Pages 401-410: tens digit is 0\n- 411-420: 1\n- 421-430: 2\n- 431-440: 3\n- 441-450: 4\n- 451-460: 5\n- 461-470: 6\n- 471-480: 7\n- 481-488: 8\n\nSo, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears once in the 441-450 range, which is 10 pages, so 10 times? Wait, no, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 pages from 441-450, so that's 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for the pages 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, that's 8 pages. So, the digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place in the last partial hundred.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because in the 401-488 range, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490). So, in the 441-450 block, the tens digit is 4, which contributes 10 times. In the 481-490 block, the tens digit is 8, but we only have 8 pages (481-488), so the digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place.\n\nTherefore, for the tens place in the last 88 pages:\n\n- 4 appears 10 times (441-450)\n- 8 appears 8 times (481-488)\n\nSo, adding this to the first 400 pages:\n\n- Total 4's in tens place: 40 (from first 400) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50\n- Total 8's in tens place: 40 (from first 400) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48\n\nWait, but hold on, in the first 400 pages, each digit appears 40 times in the tens place, right? So, for 4, it's 40 times, and for 8, it's 40 times. Then, in the last 88 pages, 4 appears 10 more times, and 8 appears 8 more times. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's are more than 8's by 2.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 1 from 1-99, 2 from 100-199, 3 from 200-299, and 4 from 300-399 and 400-488. So, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place?\n\n- 1 appears 99 times (pages 1-99)\n- 2 appears 100 times (100-199)\n- 3 appears 100 times (200-299)\n- 4 appears 190 times (300-399 is 100 pages, and 400-488 is 89 pages, so 100 + 89 = 189? Wait, wait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, pages 300-399: that's 100 pages, so the hundreds digit is 3 for those. Pages 400-488: that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89), so the hundreds digit is 4 for those 89 pages.\n\nTherefore, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times, and the digit 3 appears 100 times, and 2 appears 100 times, and 1 appears 99 times. Wait, but I'm only interested in 4's and 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, 4's are 89, and 8's are 0. So, that's 89 more 4's than 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\n- 4's: 49\n- 8's: 49\n- Difference: 0\n\nTens place:\n\n- 4's: 50\n- 8's: 48\n- Difference: +2 (4's have 2 more)\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n- Difference: +89 (4's have 89 more)\n\nNow, adding up the differences from each place:\n\nUnits: 0\nTens: +2\nHundreds: +89\nTotal difference: 0 + 2 + 89 = 91\n\nWait, so that means there are 91 more 4's than 8's in total.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place (since 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing 1 occurrence of each digit). Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. So, that's correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nFirst 400 pages: each digit appears 40 times in the tens place (since 400 / 100 = 4, and each hundred contributes 10 times each digit). So, 40 for 4 and 40 for 8.\n\nThen, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490). So, in the tens place, 4 appears in the 441-450 block, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. 8 appears in the 481-490 block, but since we only go up to 488, that's 8 pages, so 8 times. Therefore, total in tens place: 4's = 40 + 10 = 50, 8's = 40 + 8 = 48. So, difference is +2.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's: from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times. 8's: 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up the differences:\n\nUnits: 0\nTens: +2\nHundreds: +89\nTotal: 91\n\nSo, 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly? From 400-488, that's 89 pages, each with hundreds digit 4, so 89 times. Yes, that's correct. And 8's never appear in the hundreds place, so 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nTotal 8's: units (49) + tens (48) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place Analysis:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears equally in the units place every 10 pages.\n   - Total complete sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 sets.\n   - Each digit appears 48 times in the units place.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488): digits 1-8 appear once each.\n   - Total '4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total '8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place Analysis:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for every 100 pages.\n   - First 400 pages: each digit appears 40 times in the tens place.\n   - Remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n     - '4' appears 10 times (pages 441-450).\n     - '8' appears 8 times (pages 481-488).\n   - Total '4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total '8's in tens place: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place Analysis:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages.\n   - '4' appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n   - '8' never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total '4's in hundreds place: 89.\n   - Total '8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\n4. **Total Count and Difference:**\n   - Total '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - Total '8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n   - Difference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 91 more times than the digit '8'.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by understanding how page numbers are structured and then count the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each digit place separately.\n\nFirst, I know that page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, each page number is either one, two, or three digits long. I think it's easier to count the number of times each digit appears in the units place, tens place, and hundreds place separately. That way, I can avoid missing any numbers or double-counting.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0 to 9. So, in each block, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 also appears once. For example, in 1-10, 4 appears in 4, and 8 appears in 8. Similarly, in 11-20, 4 appears in 14, and 8 appears in 18, and so on.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). So, in each of these 48 blocks, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. That gives 48 occurrences of 4 and 48 occurrences of 8 in the units place.\n\nBut wait, there are also 8 extra numbers beyond the 480th page. Let me check those. From 481 to 488, the units digits are 1 through 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, that's 1 more 4 and 1 more 8 in the units place. Adding that to the previous count, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's, 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, so in the units place, they are equal. So, no difference there.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers.\n\nSo, in each 100-number block, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89). Now, how many complete 100-number blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 extra numbers (401-488).\n\nIn each of these 4 blocks, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 for each digit. Now, let's look at the remaining 88 numbers (401-488). The tens digits here go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 and 8 appear?\n\nWell, 4 in the tens place occurs in the range 440-449, but wait, our range is 401-488. So, 440-449 is within that. That's 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in 440-449. But wait, 440 is beyond 488? No, 440 is less than 488, so yes, 440-449 is within 401-488. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in this partial block.\n\nWhat about 8 in the tens place? That would be 480-489, but since our book ends at 488, it's 480-488. So, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Therefore, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the partial block.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times in the partial block. Adding that to the 40 from the complete blocks, the total for 4 in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50, and for 8, it's 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. That means there's a difference of 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 times. So yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for numbers 100 and above. In a 488-page book, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nFrom 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's 0, but we're not counting that. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; from 200-299, it's 2; from 300-399, it's 3; and from 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place?\n\n- 1 appears in 100-199: that's 100 numbers, so 100 times.\n- 2 appears in 200-299: another 100 times.\n- 3 appears in 300-399: another 100 times.\n- 4 appears in 400-488: that's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.\n\nSo, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, since we're only interested in the digits 4 and 8, let's see how many times each appears in the hundreds place.\n\n- 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n- 8 appears zero times in the hundreds place because the hundreds digit goes up to 4, and 8 is higher than 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place for page numbers up to 488.\n\nWait, that's an important point. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, that's a difference of 89 more 4's than 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, yes, 8's count is zero here.\n\nSo, summarizing the hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times. So, that's a difference of 89 in favor of 4.\n\nNow, let's add up the counts from each digit place.\n\nFirst, units place:\n- 4: 49\n- 8: 49\nDifference: 0\n\nTens place:\n- 4: 50\n- 8: 49\nDifference: +1 for 4\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4: 89\n- 8: 0\nDifference: +89 for 4\n\nSo, total difference is 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm adding correctly. The difference from units is 0, from tens is +1, and from hundreds is +89, so total difference is 1 + 89 = 90. So, 4's appear 90 times more than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me confirm each step again to avoid mistakes.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- Each 10 numbers: 1 occurrence of 4 and 8.\n- 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1 to both 4 and 8.\n- 48 * 1 = 48 for both.\n- Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n- So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4; same for 8.\n\nTens place:\n- Each 100 numbers: 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place.\n- 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400).\n- Each block contributes 10 to both 4 and 8 in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40 each.\n- Now, the remaining 88 numbers (401-488) have tens digits from 0 to 8.\n- In the tens place, 4 occurs in 440-449: 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n- 8 occurs in 480-488: 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n- So, total tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4; 40 + 9 = 49 for 8.\n- Difference in tens place: 1 more 4.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 1 appears 100 times (100-199)\n- 2 appears 100 times (200-299)\n- 3 appears 100 times (300-399)\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488)\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place because 800 would be beyond 488.\n- So, 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n- Difference in hundreds place: 89 more 4's.\n\nAdding up the differences:\n- Units: 0\n- Tens: +1\n- Hundreds: +89\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nSo, 4's appear 90 times more than 8's in the page numbers.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when I counted the hundreds place, I considered that 4 appears 89 times, but I'm not sure if that's accurate. Let me check: from 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nAnd 8 never appears in the hundreds place, so that's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me recount the tens place for the partial block.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, for each 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in 401-488, which is 88 numbers, how many times does each tens digit appear?\n\nWait, perhaps another way to look at it is: in the tens place, for numbers 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8, but not completing the full 9 cycles. Let me see:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 numbers)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10 numbers)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10 numbers)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10 numbers)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 numbers)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10 numbers)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10 numbers)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10 numbers)\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 numbers)\n\nWait, but 401-488 is 88 numbers. Let me count the blocks:\n\nFrom 401-488:\n\n- 401-410: 10 numbers, tens digit 0\n- 411-420: 10, tens digit 1\n- 421-430: 10, tens digit 2\n- 431-440: 10, tens digit 3\n- 441-450: 10, tens digit 4\n- 451-460: 10, tens digit 5\n- 461-470: 10, tens digit 6\n- 471-480: 10, tens digit 7\n- 481-488: 8 numbers, tens digit 8\n\nSo, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 8 = 88 numbers. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 times, and tens digit 8 occurs in 481-488, which is 8 numbers. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 9, but now I'm seeing 8.\n\nWait, that's a discrepancy. Let me check: 481-488 is 8 numbers, right? 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, that's 8 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 8 times, not 9. So, I think I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, so in the tens place, in the partial block of 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (in 441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (in 481-488). So, that's 10 and 8 respectively.\n\nTherefore, the total in the tens place would be:\n\n- 4: 40 (from complete blocks) + 10 = 50\n- 8: 40 (from complete blocks) + 8 = 48\n\nSo, the difference in the tens place is 50 - 48 = +2 for 4's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 9, but now it's 8. So, I must have miscalculated earlier.\n\nWait, let me go through this again carefully.\n\nIn the partial block from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but the last group is only 8 numbers (481-488), so the tens digit 8 appears 8 times, not 9.\n\nSo, in the tens place, the count for 4 is 10 (from 441-450) and for 8 is 8 (from 481-488). Therefore, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 8 times in the partial block.\n\nSo, total tens place counts:\n\n- 4: 40 (from 4 blocks) + 10 = 50\n- 8: 40 (from 4 blocks) + 8 = 48\n\nSo, the difference in the tens place is 50 - 48 = +2 for 4's.\n\nWait, that changes things. So, previously I thought the difference was +1, but now it's +2. Let me adjust that.\n\nSo, units place: 49 each, difference 0.\n\nTens place: 50 for 4, 48 for 8, difference +2.\n\nHundreds place: 89 for 4, 0 for 8, difference +89.\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 2 + 89 = 91.\n\nWait, so that's 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because I initially thought 90, then realized a miscalculation leading to 91. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, in the partial block of 401-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? From 481-488, that's 8 numbers, so 8 times. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 8 times in the partial block, making the total 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nSimilarly, 4 appears 10 times in the partial block, so total 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 48 times. So, difference is +2.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times. So, difference is +89.\n\nUnits place: 49 each, so 0 difference.\n\nTotal difference: 2 + 89 = 91.\n\nWait, so that's 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut earlier, I thought the difference was 90. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let me recount the units place. From 1-488, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the units place.\n\nEach block of 10 has one 4 and one 8 in the units place. There are 48 full blocks (1-480), so 48 times each. Then, from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4, and same for 8. So, that's correct.\n\nTens place: 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 48 times, difference +2.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times, difference +89.\n\nSo, total difference is 0 + 2 + 89 = 91.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me check how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nFrom 400-488, that's 89 numbers. Each of these has 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times.\n\nIs that correct? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. Yes.\n\nSo, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and 8 never appears there. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: units (49) + tens (48) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nSo, 188 - 97 = 91. So, 4's appear 91 more times than 8's.\n\nWait, that seems correct now. So, the initial miscalculation was in the tens place, where I thought 8 appeared 9 times, but it's actually 8 times.\n\nSo, the correct difference is 91.\n\nWait, but let me check again: 488 pages.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, correct.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 48 times.\n\nIn the units place, both appear 49 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 89 + 50 + 49 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 0 + 48 + 49 = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference was 90, but after correcting the tens place, it's 91.\n\nWait, perhaps I should also consider whether 0 is a valid digit in the hundreds place. But in page numbers, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, but we don't print leading zeros, so 0 doesn't appear in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to check: let's count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nSo, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check another approach. Maybe using a formula or a different counting method.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor units digit:\n\n- The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is floor(N/10) + (1 if d \u2264 N%10 else 0).\n\nSimilarly for tens digit:\n\n- The number of times a digit d appears in the tens place is floor((N/100)*10) + extra, depending on the remainder.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use a formula.\n\nBut maybe I can use this approach for both 4 and 8.\n\nLet me try for digit 4:\n\nUnits place:\n\n- Number of times 4 appears in units place: floor(488/10) + (1 if 4 <= 488%10 else 0).\n\n488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. 488%10 is 8, which is >=4, so add 1. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Number of times 4 appears in tens place: floor(488/100)*10 + (min(488%100 - 4*10 +1, 10) if 4*10 <= 488%100 else 0).\n\nWait, perhaps a better way: For the tens place, the formula is:\n\ncount = (number // 100) * 10 + min(10, (number % 100) - digit*10 +1)\n\nBut if digit*10 > number %100, then it's 0.\n\nWait, let's compute for digit 4 in tens place:\n\nnumber = 488\n\nnumber // 100 = 4\n\nSo, count = 4*10 = 40.\n\nNow, the remainder is 488 % 100 = 88.\n\nSo, digit*10 = 40.\n\nIf 40 <= 88, then add min(10, 88 - 40 +1) = min(10, 49) = 10.\n\nSo, total count for 4 in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8 in tens place:\n\ncount = (488 // 100)*10 + min(10, 488%100 - 8*10 +1)\n\n488//100 = 4, so 4*10 =40.\n\n8*10=80.\n\nSince 80 <=88, add min(10, 88 -80 +1)= min(10,9)=9.\n\nSo, total count for 8 in tens place: 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 48, but according to this formula, it's 49. Hmm, that's conflicting with my earlier count.\n\nWait, let me check: from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 times. So, the count should be 9 in the partial block, making total 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 8. That must have been a mistake.\n\nWait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, that's 9 numbers, so 9 times the tens digit 8 appears in the partial block.\n\nSo, that means the count for 8 in the tens place is 40 +9=49, not 48 as I previously thought. So, that was my mistake earlier.\n\nSo, correcting that:\n\nIn the tens place:\n\n- 4 appears 50 times\n- 8 appears 49 times\nDifference: +1 for 4.\n\nIn the hundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times\n- 8 appears 0 times\nDifference: +89 for 4.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 4:49\n- 8:49\nDifference:0\n\nSo, total difference:\n\n0 (units) +1 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =90.\n\nWait, so according to this formula, the count for 8 in the tens place is 49, which conflicts with my earlier manual count where I thought it was 8 times in the partial block, but that's because I miscounted the numbers.\n\nWait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times, not 8. So, in the partial block, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place. Therefore, total count for 8 in the tens place is 40 +9=49.\n\nSo, that means in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times, so difference is +1 for 4.\n\nAdding up:\n\nUnits:0\n\nTens:+1\n\nHundreds:+89\n\nTotal difference:90.\n\nSo, 4's appear 90 times more than 8's.\n\nWait, so earlier I made a mistake in the manual count by thinking it was 8 times, but it's actually 9 times. So, the correct count is 49 for 8 in the tens place.\n\nTherefore, the correct difference is 90.\n\nSo, I think I confused myself earlier by miscounting the numbers in the partial block. The formula gives me 49 for 8 in the tens place, which is correct because 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times the tens digit 8 appears.\n\nTherefore, the correct difference is 90.\n\nLet me confirm this again:\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50+89=188\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49+0=98\n\nWait, wait, that's 98, not 97. So, 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought 8's were 97, but according to this, it's 98. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, in the tens place, 8 appears 49 times, so 49 in tens, 49 in units, 0 in hundreds: total 98.\n\nSo, 188 -98=90.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nEarlier, I thought the tens place for 8 was 48, leading to 97, but that was incorrect. It's actually 49, leading to 98.\n\nSo, the correct difference is 90.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting '4's and '8's in the Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes one '4' and one '8' in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks (1-480), contributing 48 each.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) contribute one '4' (484) and one '8' (488).\n   - **Total in units place:** 49 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n2. **Counting '4's and '8's in the Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 '4's and 10 '8's in the tens place.\n   - There are 4 complete blocks (1-400), contributing 40 each.\n   - The remaining 88 numbers (401-488) contribute 10 '4's (440-449) and 9 '8's (480-488).\n   - **Total in tens place:** 50 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n3. **Counting '4's and '8's in the Hundreds Place:**\n   - The hundreds digit '4' appears in pages 400-488, contributing 89 '4's.\n   - The digit '8' never appears in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 89 '4's and 0 '8's.\n\n4. **Calculating the Total Counts:**\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Determining the Difference:**\n   - **Difference:** 188 (total '4's) - 98 (total '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' appears 90 times more than the digit '8' in the page numbers.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by understanding how page numbers are structured and then count the occurrences of 4's and 8's separately.\n\nFirst, I know that page numbers go from 1 to 488, each printed once. So, I need to consider each digit in these numbers. That means looking at units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Wait, but since 488 is a three-digit number, the hundreds place goes up to 4, right? So, pages 1-9 are single-digit, 10-99 are two-digit, and 100-488 are three-digit. Maybe I should handle each of these ranges separately.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each place value: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra numbers. So, in each of these 48 sets, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit is 1-8, so no 4 there. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for the tens place, every 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in each block of 100. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. So, how many such blocks are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more numbers (401-488). In each of the 4 blocks, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the remaining 88 numbers, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, it's 1; and so on up to 480-488, where the tens digit is 8. So, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, that's 10 more. So, total 4's in the tens place would be 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: Here, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers, meaning 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I did that right. Let me check: 400 is included, so from 400 to 488, that's 88 pages beyond 400, so 89 pages in total. So, yes, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's: units place 48, tens place 50, hundreds place 89. So total 4's would be 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for 8's. I'll go through each place value again.\n\nStarting with the units place: As before, every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once. So, in 488 pages, there are 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so that's one more 8 (page 488). So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similar to the 4's, every 100 numbers, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, how many complete blocks of 100 are there? 4 complete blocks, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in the range 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8 in this case. So, 0 occurrences of 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's would be units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds place 0. So, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 8's in the tens place, plus the 40 from the complete blocks, so 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 187, total 8's: 98. The question is how many more 4's than 8's, so 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, for the hundreds place of 4's, I had 89, but let me confirm: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, correct. So, 89 4's there.\n\nFor 4's in the tens place, I had 50. Let me recount: in each 100, 10 times 4 in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more, totaling 50. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 48. Because 488 / 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4, so 48. Correct.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 48 complete sets, 48, plus one more in 488, so 49. Correct.\n\nTens place for 8's: 40 from the complete blocks, and 9 from 480-488, so 49. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I feel like that's a big difference. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 is correct.\n\nWait, but let me count the 4's in another way to verify. Maybe using a formula or a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, for each digit place, the number of times a digit appears can be calculated using a formula. For example, in the units place, the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to n is given by:\n\nLet me recall the formula. For the units digit, it's floor((n + 1) / 10) * 1, but that's for each digit. Wait, no, more accurately, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is equal to the number of complete groups of 10, which is floor(n / 10), plus an extra 1 if the units digit of n is >= d.\n\nWait, but in our case, for digit 4, in the units place, it's floor(488 / 10) = 48, and since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so we add 1. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, that's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, no, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: floor(n / 10).\n\nEach group contributes 1 occurrence of d in the units place, so that's floor(n / 10).\n\nIf the units digit of n is >= d, then we add 1 more occurrence.\n\nWait, so for 4's in the units place, n=488.\n\nfloor(488 / 10) = 48.\n\n488 mod 10 = 8, which is >=4, so add 1.\n\nSo total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 48. That's conflicting. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, when I was counting earlier, I considered that from 1-480, there are 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, from 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so no 4. So, total 48. But according to the formula, it's 49. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is correct, and my initial counting was wrong. Let me check with a smaller number. Let's say n=14.\n\nFrom 1 to 14, how many 4's in units place? They are 4 and 14, so two 4's.\n\nUsing the formula: floor(14/10)=1, and 14 mod 10=4, which is >=4, so 1 + 1=2. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for n=13: floor(13/10)=1, 13 mod 10=3 <4, so 1 + 0=1. Correct, only 4.\n\nSo, for n=488, units digit is 8 >=4, so 48 +1=49. So, my initial count was wrong; it's actually 49 4's in the units place.\n\nWait, so that changes things. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by not adding that extra 1. So, let's correct that.\n\nSo, for 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nTens place: Let's recalculate.\n\nIn the tens place, for each 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, from 1-400, there are 4 complete blocks of 100, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 *10=40.\n\nThen, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in the range 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10.\n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place: 40 +10=50.\n\nWait, but let me use the formula for the tens place. The number of times digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to n is calculated as:\n\nLet me think. For the tens place, each block of 100 contributes 10 times the digit d in the tens place. So, for n=488, the number of complete hundreds is 4 (since 4*100=400). So, 4 *10=40.\n\nThen, the remaining part is from 401-488, which is 88 numbers. The tens digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 more.\n\nSo, total 50.\n\nWait, so that's consistent with my earlier count.\n\nNow, hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was 187, but now it's 188. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, 49 +50=99, plus 89=188. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\nUnits place: Using the formula, floor(488/10)=48, and 488 mod 10=8 >=8, so add 1. So, 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place: For each 100, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, from 1-400, there are 4 complete blocks, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 9 more.\n\nSo, total 8's in tens place: 40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: Since 488 is less than 800, there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 89. So, now I'm getting 90. Let me check again.\n\nWait, for 4's, units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nFor 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, so I think I initially made a mistake in the units place for 4's, which affected the total count.\n\nWait, let me go back. Earlier, I thought that from 1-480, there are 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48. Then, 481-488, no 4's. So, total 48. But using the formula, it's 49. So, which is correct?\n\nLet me take a smaller example. Let's say n=48.\n\nFrom 1-48, how many 4's in the units place? They are 4,14,24,34,44. That's 5 times. Wait, but 48/10=4.8, so floor(48/10)=4, and 48 mod 10=8>=4, so 4+1=5. Correct.\n\nSo, in 1-48, there are 5 4's in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, in 1-488, units digit 4's would be floor(488/10)=48, and 488 mod 10=8>=4, so 48+1=49. So, correct.\n\nTherefore, I must have made a mistake earlier by not adding that extra 1, leading to the correct total of 49 units place 4's, leading to 188 total 4's.\n\nSo, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the 8's again. Units place:49, tens place:49, so total 98.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 89, but that was due to an error in the units place count. Now, after correcting, it's 90.\n\nWait, let me check another way. Maybe using a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10)=48, plus 1 if the last digit is >=4, which it is (8>=4), so 49.\n\nNumber of 8's: floor(488/10)=48, plus 1 if the last digit is >=8, which it is (8>=8), so 49.\n\nFor tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40, plus in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10. So, total 50.\n\nNumber of 8's: floor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40, plus in the remaining 88 numbers, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, total 49.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nNumber of 8's: since 488 <800, 0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 +50 +89=188.\n\n8's:49 +49 +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Every 10 numbers contribute one '4' in the units place.\n     - Total sets of 10 in 488: floor(488/10) = 48.\n     - Since the last number (488) has a units digit \u22654, add 1.\n     - Total '4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - Every 100 numbers contribute 10 '4's in the tens place.\n     - Complete hundreds in 488: floor(488/100) = 4, contributing 4\u00d710 = 40.\n     - In the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), '4' appears in the tens place from 440-449, which is 10 numbers.\n     - Total '4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - '4' appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n     - Total '4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Every 10 numbers contribute one '8' in the units place.\n     - Total sets of 10 in 488: floor(488/10) = 48.\n     - Since the last number (488) has a units digit \u22658, add 1.\n     - Total '8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - Every 100 numbers contribute 10 '8's in the tens place.\n     - Complete hundreds in 488: floor(488/100) = 4, contributing 4\u00d710 = 40.\n     - In the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), '8' appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n     - Total '8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - No '8's in the hundreds place since 488 < 800.\n     - Total '8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Difference = Total '4's - Total '8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Maybe I should consider how often each digit appears in each place\u2014units, tens, hundreds\u2014since page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nFirst, I think I should separate the problem into looking at the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place individually. That way, I can count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each position and then add them up.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of 10 consecutive numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, and so on, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, in each block of 10, there's one 4 and one 8. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, there are 48 full blocks of 10, and then an extra 8 pages. Wait, actually, maybe I should think of it as 488 pages, so from 1 to 488, how many times does each digit appear in the units place?\n\nLet me calculate the number of times 4 appears in the units place. For every 10 pages, it appears once, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full times, but since 488 is the last page, which is 488, the 49th occurrence would be on page 484? Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, so the units digit cycles every 10. So, from 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so no additional 4's. So total 4's in units place are 48.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, it's the same logic. Each block of 10 has one 8, so 48 times from 1 to 480, and then in 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so page 488 has an 8 in the units place. So that's one more 8, making it 49 times. Wait, but hold on, 488 is included, so in the last block, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1 to 8, so page 488 is the 8th page in that block, so yes, that's an additional 8. So total 8's in units place are 49.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Because 488 is the last page, so in the units place, from 1 to 488, how many 8's are there? Let me think differently. The number of times 8 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete tens plus one if the last page ends with an 8. Since 488 ends with an 8, so it's (488 // 10) + 1. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so integer division gives 48, then +1 because the last digit is 8, so 49 times. That seems right.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the units place, since 488 doesn't end with a 4, it's just 48 times. So units place: 4's = 48, 8's = 49.\n\nNow moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages, right? So in each block of 100, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So for example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 ten times (40-49), and 8 ten times (80-89). Similarly, from 101-200, the same pattern repeats, and so on.\n\nSo let's figure out how many complete hundreds there are in 488. There are four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, no, 488 is less than 500, so it's four full hundreds (1-400) and then 401-488.\n\nSo for each hundred block, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times. So in four hundred blocks (1-400), that's 4 times 10 = 40 for each digit. Now, what about the last partial block, 401-488?\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nFirst, for 4's in the tens place: The tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 pages. But wait, our last page is 488, so 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 times.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place: The tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488 inclusive, but 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 pages because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So that's 9 times.\n\nWait, no, actually, from 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 pages where the tens digit is 8.\n\nSo in the partial block 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nTherefore, total for the tens place:\n\n4's: 40 (from the four hundreds) + 10 = 50\n\n8's: 40 (from the four hundreds) + 9 = 49\n\nWait, but hold on, in the four hundreds, each hundred contributes 10 times for each digit, so 4 hundreds would be 4*10=40 for each digit. Then in the last partial hundred, 401-488, 4's in tens place are 10 times (440-449), and 8's are 9 times (480-488). So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo total in tens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 from 1-99, 2 from 100-199, 3 from 200-299, 4 from 300-399, and 4 again from 400-488. Wait, no, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 pages (400-488 inclusive). So how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place?\n\nFrom 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all those pages, so that's 89 times. Now, does 8 ever appear in the hundreds place? Since the book has 488 pages, the hundreds digit only goes up to 4. So 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, 8's in hundreds place = 0.\n\nSo total for hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit across all places.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits place: 48\n\nTens place: 50\n\nHundreds place: 89\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate that. 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49\n\nTens place: 49\n\nHundreds place: 0\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 4's are more than 8's, but I think I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, when calculating the units place for 4's, I said 48 times. But let me think again: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEach 10 pages, 4 appears once. So 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full times, and then in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear there. So 48 times is correct.\n\nFor 8's in units place, it's 49 times because 488 ends with an 8, so that's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, I had 50 for 4's and 49 for 8's. Let me check that again.\n\nFrom 1-400, each hundred block contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place, so 4 hundreds * 10 = 40 for each. Then in 401-488, 4's in tens place are 10 times (440-449), and 8's are 9 times (480-488). So 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times (from 400-488), and 8 never appears, so that's correct.\n\nSo total 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't double-count or miss anything.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is to consider each digit place separately and count the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a more systematic approach.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's = floor(488 / 10) = 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full times)\n\nNumber of 8's = floor(488 / 10) + (1 if 488 mod 10 >= 8 else 0) \u2192 48 + 1 = 49\n\nFor tens digit:\n\nNumber of 4's in tens place: floor(488 / 100) * 10 + (if the last partial hundred has tens digit >=4, then add the count from 40-49 in tens place)\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of it as:\n\nEach hundred block contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place.\n\nNumber of complete hundreds = floor(488 / 100) = 4 (since 4*100=400)\n\nSo 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 times for 4 and 8 in the tens place, so 4*10=40 each.\n\nThen, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8.\n\nSo for 4's in tens place in this partial hundred: from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nFor 8's in tens place: from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page), so 9 times.\n\nThus, total tens place:\n\n4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n\n8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\nFor hundreds digit:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89)\n\nNumber of times 8 appears: 0, since the hundreds digit never reaches 8.\n\nSo total hundreds place:\n\n4's: 89\n\n8's: 0\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's total: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187\n\n8's total: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 89 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 89 was the count for hundreds place, but the difference is also 89. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\n\nEach digit place is considered separately.\n\nUnits place: 4's = 48, 8's = 49\n\nTens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 49\n\nHundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0\n\nSo adding up:\n\n4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\n8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nI think that's correct. So the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. We analyze each digit's appearance in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- **4's:** Each 10 pages contribute one 4. With 48 full decades (1-480), there are 48 occurrences. The last 8 pages (481-488) don't add a 4.\n- **8's:** Similarly, 48 full decades give 48 occurrences, plus one more from page 488, totaling 49.\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- **4's:** Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences. Four full hundreds (1-400) give 40. The last partial hundred (401-488) adds 10 from 440-449.\n- **8's:** Four full hundreds give 40. The last partial hundred adds 9 from 480-488.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- **4's:** Pages 400-488 contribute 89 occurrences.\n- **8's:** No occurrence since the book doesn't reach page 800.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 187 - 98 = 89\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by understanding how page numbers are structured and then count the occurrences of 4 and 8 separately.\n\nFirst, I know that page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, each page number is a one-, two-, or three-digit number. I think I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That way, I can count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place and then sum them up.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for 8. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and an extra 8 pages. In each complete set, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for 48 sets, that's 48 times each. Now, the extra 8 pages are from 481 to 488. In these, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more in the units place. So, total units place 4's are 48, and 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me check again. The total number of units digits is 488, so the number of complete tens is 48 (since 48*10=480), and then 8 more pages. So, in each complete set, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place, so 48 each. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1 through 8, so 8 appears once, making it 48 +1=49 for 8's, and 4's don't appear in the units place in these 8 pages, so 4's remain at 48. So, units place gives 48 fours and 49 eights.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages, right? So, for each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 ten times (40-49) and 8 ten times (80-89). So, for each hundred, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? Well, 4 hundreds (1-400), and then 88 more pages. So, in each of the 4 complete hundreds, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. So, that's 4*10=40 each.\n\nNow, the remaining 88 pages are from 401 to 488. Let's look at the tens digit here. From 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 for each hundred. Wait, but 401-488 is actually part of the 400-499 range, so the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, let's break this down:\n\n- 400-409: tens digit is 0\n- 410-419: tens digit is 1\n- 420-429: tens digit is 2\n- 430-439: tens digit is 3\n- 440-449: tens digit is 4\n- 450-459: tens digit is 5\n- 460-469: tens digit is 6\n- 470-479: tens digit is 7\n- 480-488: tens digit is 8\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears once in the 440-449 range, which is 10 times, right? Because from 440 to 449, each number has 4 in the tens place. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for each of these. So, that's 9 times, not 10.\n\nWait, but in the 480-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for each page from 480 to 488, which is 9 pages. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, adding this to the previous 40 each, we get:\n\n- 4's in tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50\n- 8's in tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Because from 400-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8, but each cycle is 10 pages except the last one, which is only 9 pages. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages, and the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, yes, that's correct. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times in the 400-488 range, so adding to the previous 40 each, we get 50 fours and 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89), so the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 pages. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit goes up to 4 in this book, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8's count is 0 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate: 48+50=98, 98+89=187\n\nNow for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place: 48 fours and 49 eights. That seems correct because in the last 8 pages, 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so 8 appears once, making it 49 eights.\n\nTens place: For 1-400, each hundred has 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, 40+10=50 fours, 40+9=49 eights. That adds up.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 doesn't appear at all, so 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if I counted correctly in the tens place for 400-488. Let me check again. From 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit, how many times does it appear?\n\n- 0: 10 times (400-409)\n- 1: 10 times (410-419)\n- 2: 10 times (420-429)\n- 3: 10 times (430-439)\n- 4: 10 times (440-449)\n- 5: 10 times (450-459)\n- 6: 10 times (460-469)\n- 7: 10 times (470-479)\n- 8: 9 times (480-488)\n\nSo, yes, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 9 times. So, adding that to the previous 40 each, that's correct.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So, the number of 4's is 187, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 89.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting 4's and 8's in Units Place:**\n   - Each set of 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) has exactly one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n   - Total complete sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 sets (since 48*10=480).\n   - Each set contributes 1 to both 4's and 8's in units place, so 48 each.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488) have an additional 8 in units place, making 8's count 49.\n   - Total units place: 48 fours, 49 eights.\n\n2. **Counting 4's and 8's in Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred (e.g., 1-100) has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 80-89).\n   - There are 4 complete hundreds (1-400), contributing 4*10=40 fours and 40 eights.\n   - From 401-488:\n     - 440-449: 10 fours.\n     - 480-488: 9 eights.\n   - Total tens place: 40+10=50 fours, 40+9=49 eights.\n\n3. **Counting 4's and 8's in Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, totaling 89 pages.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place in a 488-page book.\n   - Total hundreds place: 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\n4. **Summing Up:**\n   - Total 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n   - Total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - 187 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by understanding how page numbers are structured and then count the occurrences of 4's and 8's separately before comparing them.\n\nFirst, I know that each page is numbered from 1 to 488, and each number is printed once. So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the count of 8's from the count of 4's to find the difference.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to consider each digit place separately: the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place. I'll go through each place one by one and count the number of 4's and 8's in those positions.\n\nStarting with the units place. For numbers from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times a specific digit appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then adjusting for any remaining pages.\n\nWait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. So, for the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times, and then in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, for the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times, and the digit 8 appears 48 times plus one more time in the extra 8 numbers (since 488 has an 8 in the units place). Wait, no, 488 is the last page, so the units digits in the extra 8 pages are 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more. So, units place: 4's = 48, 8's = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. The total number of pages is 488, which is 48*10 + 8. So, for each digit in the units place, it appears 48 times in the full blocks. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once more in 484, and the digit 8 appears once more in 488. So, the total for units place is 4's: 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place? That seems correct because in the last 8 numbers, both 4 and 8 appear once each in the units place.\n\nWait, no, 484 is page 484, so units digit is 4, and 488 is page 488, units digit is 8. So, yes, both 4 and 8 get an extra count in the units place, making it 49 each.\n\nNow moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), then 1 (11-19), 2 (21-29), etc., up to 9 (91-99). So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred.\n\nNow, the total number of pages is 488, which is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8.\n\nSo, for the first 400 pages, we have 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 occurrences of 4 and 8 in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 = 40 for each digit.\n\nNow, the remaining 88 pages are from 401 to 488. Let's look at the tens digit here. From 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), and 8 (481-488). Wait, but 488 is page 488, so the tens digit goes up to 8, but only from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 appears in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in this last partial hundred.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. From 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0\n- 411-420: tens digit 1\n- 421-430: tens digit 2\n- 431-440: tens digit 3\n- 441-450: tens digit 4\n- 451-460: tens digit 5\n- 461-470: tens digit 6\n- 471-480: tens digit 7\n- 481-490: tens digit 8\n\nBut since we only go up to 488, the last group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in this last group.\n\nSo, in the tens place, for the partial hundred (401-488), the digit 4 appears 10 times (in 441-450), and the digit 8 appears 8 times (in 481-488).\n\nTherefore, total for the tens place:\n\n- Digit 4: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 10 in the partial hundred = 50\n- Digit 8: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 8 in the partial hundred = 48\n\nWait, but wait, no. Wait, in the first 400 pages, each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of 4 and 8 in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 for each digit. Then, in the partial hundred (401-488), 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, total for tens place:\n\n- 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 8's: 40 + 8 = 48\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 48 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is a bit different because it only changes every 100 pages. From 1-99, there is no hundreds digit, so we can ignore that. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (including both 400 and 488). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, which is still in the 400s. So, the hundreds digit for 8 would start at 800, which is beyond 488. Therefore, 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, summarizing the hundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nNow, let's add up all the occurrences for each digit across units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nFirst, for the digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate that. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nNow for the digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nWait, so total 4's are 188, and total 8's are 97. So, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- For 488 pages, units digit cycles every 10. 488 / 10 = 48 full cycles, with 8 remaining. So, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in units place, and then in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so digits 1-8 each get an extra count. So, 4 and 8 each get +1, making their units place counts 48 +1=49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 40 each. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so +10. The tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so +8. So, 4's tens: 40 +10=50, 8's tens:40 +8=48. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place in this book, so 0.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n8's: 49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =97\n\nDifference: 188 -97=91\n\nWait, that seems high, but maybe it's correct. Let me think differently. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the total number of 4's and 8's in each position and then sum them up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nWait, another approach: for each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\nTotal numbers:488\n\nNumber of complete cycles of 10: floor(488/10)=48, remainder=8.\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears 48 times in units place. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so digits 1-8 each get an extra count. So, 4 and 8 each get +1, so units place:4's=48+1=49, 8's=48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 4*10=40 for each digit.\n\nThen, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). The tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so +10. The tens digit 8 appears in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 numbers, so +8.\n\nSo, 4's tens:40+10=50, 8's tens:40+8=48.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. 8 never appears in hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91\n\nWait, that's consistent. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can check with smaller numbers to see if my method works.\n\nFor example, let's take a book with 20 pages. How many 1's and 2's are there?\n\nUnits place: 20/10=2 full cycles, remainder 0. So, each digit 0-9 appears 2 times in units place. So, 1's:2, 2's:2.\n\nTens place: 2 hundreds (1-20), each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in tens place. Wait, but 1-20 is only two tens: 10-19 (tens digit 1) and 20 (tens digit 2). Wait, but 1-9 have tens digit 0, 10-19 have tens digit 1, 20 has tens digit 2.\n\nSo, in tens place:\n\n- 1 appears 10 times (10-19)\n- 2 appears once (20)\nSo, 1's:10, 2's:1.\n\nUnits place:\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears twice in units place (since 20/10=2). So, 1's:2, 2's:2.\n\nTotal 1's:10 (tens) +2 (units)=12\n\nTotal 2's:1 (tens) +2 (units)=3\n\nDifference:12-3=9.\n\nWait, but according to my earlier method:\n\nUnits place:20/10=2, remainder 0. So, 1's:2, 2's:2.\n\nTens place:2 hundreds, each contributing 10 times for 1's and 10 times for 2's? Wait, no, because in 1-20, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, and 2 for 20. So, in tens place, 1 appears 10 times, 2 appears once, and others appear less. So, in my earlier method, for tens place, each hundred contributes 10 times each digit, but in reality, it's only 10 times for 1's in the first hundred, and 1 time for 2's in the second hundred. So, my method might not be accurate for numbers less than 100.\n\nWait, so maybe my method is correct for numbers beyond 100, but not for smaller numbers. Hmm, perhaps I need to adjust.\n\nWait, in the 20-page example, using my method:\n\nUnits place:20/10=2, remainder 0. So, 1's:2, 2's:2.\n\nTens place:2 hundreds, each contributing 10 times each digit. So, 2*10=20 for each digit. But that's not correct because in reality, the tens digit only goes up to 2, and only 10-19 and 20 have tens digits 1 and 2 respectively. So, my method overestimates the tens place counts for digits beyond the actual range.\n\nWait, so perhaps my approach works only when the number of pages is a multiple of 100 or when considering up to the hundreds place. Maybe I need to adjust for when the number of pages doesn't complete a full hundred in the last partial hundred.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the book has 488 pages, which is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). So, in this case, the last partial hundred is 401-488, which is 88 pages. So, perhaps my method works because I'm correctly calculating the tens and units digits in that partial hundred.\n\nWait, but in the 20-page example, my method overestimates because the last partial hundred is only 20 pages, which is less than a hundred. So, perhaps I need a different approach for the tens place when the last partial hundred is not a full hundred.\n\nWait, maybe I should calculate the tens place by considering how many full cycles of 100 there are and then the remaining pages.\n\nWait, another approach: for the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in each hundred. So, for n hundreds, each digit appears 10n times in the tens place. Then, for the remaining pages beyond the full hundreds, we need to calculate how many times each digit appears in the tens place.\n\nSo, in the case of 488 pages:\n\n- Number of full hundreds:4 (1-400)\n- Remaining pages:88 (401-488)\n\nFor the full hundreds (1-400), each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place per hundred, so 4*10=40 times each.\n\nNow, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), we need to see how many times each digit appears in the tens place.\n\nThe numbers from 401-488 can be broken down as:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0\n- 411-420: tens digit 1\n- 421-430: tens digit 2\n- 431-440: tens digit 3\n- 441-450: tens digit 4\n- 451-460: tens digit 5\n- 461-470: tens digit 6\n- 471-480: tens digit 7\n- 481-488: tens digit 8\n\nEach of these blocks except the last one has 10 numbers, but the last block (481-488) has only 8 numbers.\n\nSo, for the tens digits:\n\n- 0:10 numbers\n- 1:10\n- 2:10\n- 3:10\n- 4:10\n- 5:10\n- 6:10\n- 7:10\n- 8:8\n\nSo, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nTherefore, total in tens place:\n\n- 4's:40 (from full hundreds) +10=50\n- 8's:40 +8=48\n\nWhich matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, perhaps my method is correct because in the case of 488 pages, the last partial hundred is 88 pages, and I correctly accounted for the tens digits in that partial hundred.\n\nGoing back to the original problem, so total 4's:188, 8's:97, difference:91.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 in all of them, so 89 times. So, that's correct.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place for the first 480 pages.\n   - In the remaining 8 pages (481-488), digits 1-8 each appear once.\n   - **4's:** 48 + 1 = 49\n   - **8's:** 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times per hundred, so 4 hundreds contribute 40 times each.\n   - In the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n   - **4's:** 40 + 10 = 50\n   - **8's:** 40 + 8 = 48\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times.\n   - **4's:** 89\n   - **8's:** 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 97 = 91\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by understanding how page numbers are structured and then count the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each position.\n\nFirst, I know that page numbers go from 1 to 488. Each page number is printed once, so I need to check each digit in these numbers. I think the best approach is to consider the units place, tens place, hundreds place, and so on separately. That way, I can count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each digit position.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, in each set of 10 consecutive pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. For example, in pages 1-10, 4 appears on page 4, and 8 appears on page 8. This pattern repeats every 10 pages.\n\nNow, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 pages and then 8 extra pages. So, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times, except for the last 8 pages where only digits 1 through 8 appear once each.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, in each set of 10 pages, the units digit cycles through 0 to 9. So, for the units place, the number of times 4 appears would be 48 times (once per each set of 10) plus any additional in the remaining pages. Similarly for 8.\n\nWait, let me correct that. Since 488 is 48*10 + 8, the units digit cycles 48 full times, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once more (page 484), and 8 appears once more (page 488). So, total units digit 4's are 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. So, in units place, they are equal.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So, the units place doesn't contribute to the difference. Now, let's move on to the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times every 100 pages. For example, in pages 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (pages 1-9), 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), ..., up to 9 (90-99). So, in each hundred, each tens digit appears 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, in the next hundred pages, 100-199, the tens digit again cycles through 0-9, each appearing 10 times. Wait, no, actually, the tens digit in 100-199 is 0 (100-109), 1 (110-119), etc., up to 9 (190-199). So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 pages.\n\nNow, since our book has 488 pages, let's see how many complete hundreds we have. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages left (401-488).\n\nIn each of these 4 hundreds, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each, so for each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times as well. So, in 4 hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 times for each digit. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nFrom 401-410, the tens digit is 0, so no 4 or 8. From 411-420, tens digit is 1, so no. Similarly, 421-430: 2, 431-440: 3. Then, 441-450: 4. So, in the tens place, 4 appears once in this range, specifically from 441-450, which is 10 pages, so the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages. Wait, but 441-450 is 10 pages, so the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages, meaning 4 appears 10 times in the tens place here.\n\nSimilarly, 451-460: 5, 461-470: 6, 471-480:7, and 481-490:8. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so from 481-488, the tens digit is 8 for 8 pages. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 8 times here.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-489, but since our book stops at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. Wait, no, 480 is actually the end of the 480-489 range, but our book ends at 488. So, from 480-488, that's 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them except maybe 480? Wait, no, 480 is part of the 480-489 range, so the tens digit is 8 for all pages from 480 to 489. But since we only go up to 488, that's 9 pages where the tens digit is 8. So, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times, but wait, no, 480 is included, so 480 is page 480, which is the first page of the 480-489 range, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 pages. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages, meaning 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier, in the 401-488 range, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place? Let me list it out:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0\n- 411-420: 1\n- 421-430: 2\n- 431-440: 3\n- 441-450: 4 (10 pages)\n- 451-460:5\n- 461-470:6\n- 471-480:7 (10 pages)\n- 481-490:8 (but we only go up to 488, so 481-488: 8 pages, but wait, 481-488 is 8 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 8 occurrences.\n\nWait, no, 481-488 is 8 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 8 times.\n\nWait, but earlier, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. And 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times.\n\nSo, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place overall:\n\n- For 4: 4 hundreds * 10 times each = 40 times, plus 10 times in the remaining 88 pages, totaling 50 times.\n- For 8: 4 hundreds * 10 times each = 40 times, plus 8 times in the remaining 88 pages, totaling 48 times.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because in the hundreds place, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me think again.\n\nWait, each hundred has 100 pages, and in each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times as well. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10=40 times each.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), as I thought earlier, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, total for 4 in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, and for 8: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 48 times. So, 4 has 2 more occurrences in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). Therefore, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n\nNow, does 8 appear in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, that's 89 more 4's than 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From page 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those pages, so yes, 89 times.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49 (difference 0)\n- Tens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 48 (difference +2)\n- Hundreds place: 4's =89, 8's=0 (difference +89)\n\nTotal difference: 0 +2 +89 =91.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\nEach 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. There are 48 full sets of 10 pages, so 48 times each. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48+1=49, 8's 48+1=49. So, correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nIn each hundred, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 40 each. In the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times. So, total for 4:40+10=50, 8:40+8=48. So, difference of +2. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 400-488, which is 89 pages, hundreds digit is 4. So, 89 times. 8 doesn't appear in hundreds place, so 0. So, difference of +89.\n\nAdding up: 0 (units) +2 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =91. So, 4's appear 91 more times than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is the hundreds place correct? From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation for the remaining 88 pages in the tens place. From 401-488, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nFrom 401-410: tens digit 0\n411-420:1\n421-430:2\n431-440:3\n441-450:4 (10 pages)\n451-460:5\n461-470:6\n471-480:7 (10 pages)\n481-490:8 (but we stop at 488, so 481-488:8 pages)\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears once in 441-450 (10 pages, so 10 times), and 8 appears in 481-488 (8 pages, so 8 times). So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but 481-488 is 8 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so 8 times. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, overall, 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188\n8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=97\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me double-check the counts.\n\nWait, actually, wait a minute. I think I might have made a mistake in adding up the total counts. Let me recount.\n\nWait, no, the problem is not to find the total number of 4's and 8's, but the difference between them. So, the way I did it before, by considering each digit place separately and adding the differences, should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate the total number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract.\n\nLet me try that approach to confirm.\n\nCalculating total number of 4's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal number of 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:48\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49+48=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAnd in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 48 times. Units place, both 49 times. So, the difference is 50-48=2 in tens place, and 89-0=89 in hundreds place. So, total difference 2+89=91.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think I've considered all the cases. So, the answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Units Place Analysis:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 pages.\n   - There are 48 full sets of 10 pages in 480 pages, contributing 48 occurrences of each digit.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one '4' (page 484) and one '8' (page 488).\n   - **Total '4's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n   - **Total '8's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place Analysis:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - In 400 pages, each digit appears 40 times in the tens place.\n   - The remaining 88 pages (401-488) add:\n     - '4' appears 10 times (pages 441-450).\n     - '8' appears 8 times (pages 481-488).\n   - **Total '4's in tens place:** 40 + 10 = 50\n   - **Total '8's in tens place:** 40 + 8 = 48\n\n3. **Hundreds Place Analysis:**\n   - The hundreds digit is '4' for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n   - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place within 488 pages.\n   - **Total '4's in hundreds place:** 89\n   - **Total '8's in hundreds place:** 0\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - **Difference:** 188 - 97 = 91\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by understanding how page numbers are structured and then count the occurrences of each digit separately.\n\nFirst, I know that page numbers go from 1 to 488. Each page number is printed once, so I need to consider each digit in every page number. The digits we're interested in are 4 and 8. I need to count how many times each of these digits appears in all the page numbers and then find the difference between the two counts.\n\nLet me think about how to count the number of times a specific digit appears in a range of numbers. I remember that this can be done by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds, etc. So, maybe I should break down the problem by looking at each place value one by one.\n\nStarting with the units place. For each page number, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often. How many times does each digit appear in the units place up to page 488?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 pages, and then 8 extra pages. In each complete set of 10, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for the units place, each digit appears 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digits 1 through 8 each appear once more, and 9 and 0 don't appear in these extra pages.\n\nSo, for the units place:\n- The digit 4 appears 48 times (from the complete sets) plus 1 more time in the extra pages (page 484), totaling 49 times.\n- The digit 8 appears 48 times plus 1 more time in the extra pages (page 488), totaling 49 times.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so the units digit in 488 is 8, so yes, that's correct. So, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages, right? Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place within each hundred. So, for each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nLet's calculate how many hundreds we have in 488. Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages in the next hundred (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for the tens place:\n- Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 4 times 10 = 40 times in the complete hundreds.\n\nNow, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear?\n\nWait, actually, from 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles through 0 to 8, but each digit appears 10 times except for the last one, which might be less. Wait, no, actually, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears exactly 10 times in the 400-499 range, but since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit 8 appears from 480 to 488, which is 9 times (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers). Hmm, no, wait: 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times. But wait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, in the 400-499 range, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9, each appearing 10 times. But since we're stopping at 488, the tens digit 8 appears only from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in this incomplete hundred. Similarly, the other tens digits from 0 to 7 appear 10 times each because they complete their full 10 numbers within 401-488.\n\nWait, no, actually, from 400 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. For each tens digit d, the numbers would be from 4d0 to 4d9, but since we're only going up to 488, the last tens digit (8) only goes up to 488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times, while the others (0-7) appear 10 times each.\n\nSo, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digits:\n- 0 appears 10 times (400-409, but since we start at 401, it's 401-410, but 401-410 would be 10 numbers, but 400 is page 400, which is included? Wait, no, the book starts at page 1, so 400 is page 400, which is included. Wait, but we're considering 401-488, so page 400 is part of the previous hundred, right? So, in the 400-499 range, the tens digit 0 would be from 400-409, which is 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit 0 appears 10 times (400-409), but 400 is included in the 400-499 range. Wait, but 400 is page 400, which is part of the 400-499 hundred, so in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit 0 would be from 400-409, but 400 is included in the 400-499 hundred, so in 401-488, the tens digit 0 appears in 401-410, which is 10 numbers, but 400 is page 400, which is included in the 400-499 hundred. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate the tens digits in the incomplete hundred as follows:\n\nFrom 401 to 488, the tens digits go through 0 to 8. For each tens digit d (0-8), the numbers are 4d0 to 4d9, but since we're stopping at 488, the last tens digit (8) only goes up to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, for tens digits 0-7, each appears 10 times (from 4d0 to 4d9), but for d=8, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears 9 times, and digits 0-7 appear 10 times each.\n\nTherefore, the total number of times each digit appears in the tens place:\n- For digits 0-7: 40 times (from the complete hundreds) + 10 times (from the incomplete hundred) = 50 times each.\n- For digit 8: 40 times (from the complete hundreds) + 9 times (from the incomplete hundred) = 49 times.\n- For digit 4: 40 times (from the complete hundreds) + 10 times (from the incomplete hundred, since 4 is in 0-7) = 50 times.\n\nWait, but 4 is in 0-7, so yes, it appears 10 times in the incomplete hundred. So, the tens digit 4 appears 50 times, and the tens digit 8 appears 49 times.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. In the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 would be in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, yes, 4 appears 10 times in the incomplete hundred, making it 50 times total. Similarly, 8 appears 9 times in the incomplete hundred, making it 49 times total.\n\nSo, in the tens place:\n- Digit 4: 50 times\n- Digit 8: 49 times\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. Since the book has 488 pages, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nEach hundred block (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488) will have the hundreds digit as 0 for 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nNow, how many times does each hundreds digit appear?\n\n- Hundreds digit 0: Pages 1-99, which is 99 pages, but the hundreds digit is 0, so it doesn't contribute to the count of 4's or 8's.\n- Hundreds digit 1: Pages 100-199, which is 100 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 1 for 100 pages.\n- Hundreds digit 2: Pages 200-299, 100 pages.\n- Hundreds digit 3: Pages 300-399, 100 pages.\n- Hundreds digit 4: Pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\nSo, for the hundreds place:\n- Digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for 89 pages (400-488).\n- Digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the highest page is 488, so the hundreds digit is 4, and there's no page 800-899.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place:\n- Digit 4: 89 times\n- Digit 8: 0 times\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nStarting with digit 4:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nNow for digit 8:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nWait, but let me double-check these calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n- Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the complete sets of 10, and then in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), digits 1-8 each appear once. So, 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each complete hundred (1-100, etc.) contributes 10 times each digit in the tens place, so 4 hundreds contribute 40 times each. Then, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digits go from 0-8. For digits 0-7, each appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times. So, for 4, which is in 0-7, it's 10 more, making 50. For 8, it's 9 more, making 49. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 never appears. That's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check again to make sure I didn't overcount.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4. Pages 400-488 is 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those 89 pages, so that's correct: 89 times.\n\nAnd for the tens place, in the incomplete hundred, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), which is correct. So, 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 = 50 in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place, it's 40 from complete hundreds plus 9 from the incomplete hundred, totaling 49.\n\nUnits place is 49 for both.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm counting the hundreds place correctly, but perhaps the tens place for 4 is actually 50, which seems correct because in the incomplete hundred, 440-449 is 10 pages, so 10 times.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this by counting all the digits in all positions.\n\nAnother approach: For each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), count the number of 4's and 8's separately.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nUnits place:\n\nTotal pages: 488.\n\nNumber of times a digit appears in the units place is calculated by:\n\nFor each digit d, the count is floor((n + 10 - d) / 10), but maybe it's easier to think in terms of how many complete decades there are and the remainder.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is:\n\ncomplete = n // 10\nremainder = n % 10\n\ncount = complete\nif d <= remainder:\n    count += 1\nif d == 0:\n    count -= 1  # because 0 doesn't appear in the units place for n >=1\n\nWait, but for d=0, it's a bit different because 0 doesn't appear in the units place for numbers 1 to n. So, maybe it's better to adjust for that.\n\nBut perhaps for digits 1-9, the count is:\n\ncount = (n // 10) * 1 + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nWait, let me test this with n=488.\n\nFor d=4:\n\ncomplete = 488 // 10 = 48\nremainder = 488 % 10 = 8\n\nSince 8 >= 4, count = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly for d=8:\n\ncount = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nThat's correct, as we found earlier.\n\nNow, tens place:\n\nFor the tens digit, the formula is similar but with a factor of 100.\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to n is:\n\ncount = (n // 100) * 10\nremainder = n % 100\nif remainder >= 10 * d:\n    count += 10\nelif remainder >= d * 10:\n    count += (remainder - d * 10 + 1)\nelse:\n    count += 0\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is:\n\ncount = (n // 100) * 10\nlast_two_digits = n % 100\nif last_two_digits >= 10 * d:\n    count += 10\nelse:\n    count += (last_two_digits - 10 * d + 1) if (last_two_digits >= 10 * d) else 0\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me think.\n\nFor the tens place, each digit d appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So, for n=488:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds = 4 (since 4*100=400 <=488).\n\nSo, for each d, count = 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nThen, for the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8.\n\nFor each d, how many times does it appear in the tens place in 401-488?\n\nIf d=4:\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, count +=10.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8:\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, count +=9.\n\nTherefore, total for d=4 in tens place: 40 +10=50.\n\nFor d=8: 40 +9=49.\n\nThat's what I had before.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nFor d=4:\n\nIn 1-488, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, count=89.\n\nFor d=8: 0, since the book only goes up to 488.\n\nSo, total counts:\n\n4's: units(49) + tens(50) + hundreds(89) = 188.\n\n8's: units(49) + tens(49) + hundreds(0) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if I'm double-counting or missing something. Let me check with a smaller number to see if my method works.\n\nFor example, let's take a 20-page book. How many 1's and 2's are there?\n\nPage numbers: 1-20.\n\nCounting 1's:\n\nUnits place: 1,11,21 (but 21 is beyond 20, so 1 and 11: 2 times.\n\nTens place: 10-19: 10 times.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 1's: 2 +10=12.\n\nSimilarly, 2's:\n\nUnits place: 2,12: 2 times.\n\nTens place: 20: 1 time.\n\nTotal 2's: 2 +1=3.\n\nDifference: 12-3=9.\n\nWait, but let's count manually:\n\nPages 1-20:\n\n1: 1\n\n2: 2\n\n3:3\n\n...\n\n10:10\n\n11:11\n\n12:12\n\n13:13\n\n14:14\n\n15:15\n\n16:16\n\n17:17\n\n18:18\n\n19:19\n\n20:20\n\nCounting 1's:\n\nIn units: 1,11: 2\n\nIn tens: 10-19: 10 (each has a 1 in the tens place)\n\nTotal: 12.\n\nCounting 2's:\n\nIn units: 2,12: 2\n\nIn tens: 20:1\n\nTotal:3.\n\nDifference:12-3=9.\n\nWhich matches the calculation.\n\nSo, my method seems correct.\n\nTherefore, applying it to the original problem, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because 90 seems like a lot, but maybe it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, which is a significant contribution.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times (from 400-488), which is a lot, and 8 never appears there.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nIn the units place, both appear 49 times.\n\nSo, 4's total: 89 (hundreds) +50 (tens) +49 (units) = 188.\n\n8's total: 0 (hundreds) +49 (tens) +49 (units) =98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm confident the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in complete sets of 10 pages.\n- In the remaining 8 pages (481-488), digits 1-8 each appear once.\n- **4's:** 48 + 1 = 49\n- **8's:** 48 + 1 = 49\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times per hundred.\n- In 400-488, digits 0-7 appear 10 times each, and 8 appears 9 times.\n- **4's:** 40 (complete hundreds) + 10 = 50\n- **8's:** 40 + 9 = 49\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n- 8 does not appear.\n- **4's:** 89\n- **8's:** 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " I think I should start by understanding how page numbers are structured and then count the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 separately.\n\nFirst, I know that page numbers start at 1 and go up to 488. So, each page from 1 to 488 has a number, and I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the count of 8's from the count of 4's to find the difference.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Since 488 is a three-digit number, we'll have to check each place for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in a sequence of numbers. So, in every block of 10 numbers, each digit appears once in the units place. For example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each set of 10, 4 and 8 each appear once.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every block of 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place for every 100 numbers.\n\nThe same logic applies to the hundreds place, but since our book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can only be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, actually, from 1 to 488, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, let's break down the problem by each digit place.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's.\n\nStarting with the units place: From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units digit?\n\nWell, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488? That would be 48 blocks (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks). Each block contributes one 4, so 48 times. But wait, we have 8 more numbers after 480 (481-488), so we need to check if there's a 4 in the units place in these. 484 is in this range, so that's another 4. So total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10, which is 48, and then in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), how many times does 4 appear? Only once, at 484. So, yes, 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place for 4's. In the tens place, 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers 10 times. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. So, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? The tens digit is 0 for 401-409, 1 for 410-419, and so on. Wait, 401-488: the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 times. So, total tens place 4's would be 40 + 10 = 50 times.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, 10 times. So, total tens place 4's: 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place for 4's. The hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let's calculate that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nStarting with the units place for 8's. Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, how many complete blocks of 10 in 488? 48 blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Now, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that's another 1. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place for 8's. In each block of 100 numbers, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times, specifically in the range x80-x89. So, for each hundred, that's 10 times. How many complete hundreds are there in 488? 4 complete hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489. But our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times. Wait, but 480-489 is 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so it's 9 numbers. So, 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 times. So, yes, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place for 8's. The hundreds digit can only be 8 if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the hundreds place contributes 0 to the count of 8's.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. In the first 400 pages, we have 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10 times 8 in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me verify my counts again because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\nUnits place: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, from 481-488, which is 8 numbers, 484 has a 4 in the units place, so 1 more. Total units 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, that's 5 hundreds? Wait, no. From 1-100, 40-49 is one set. Then 101-200, 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 4 sets. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there.\n\nWait, let me think again. From 1-100: 40-49 is one set. Then 101-200: 140-149. 201-300: 240-249. 301-400: 340-349. And 401-488: 440-449. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. So, I think earlier I was correct in adding 50 for the tens place 4's.\n\nBut wait, when I did the 4's count earlier, I had 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40, and then in 401-488, 440-449 contributes another 10, so 40 +10=50. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, from 481-488, 488 has an 8 in the units place, so 1 more. Total units 8's: 49.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes one set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, in the first 400 pages, we have 4 sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 9 more. So, total tens 8's: 40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: As before, the hundreds digit is 8 only from 800-899, which is beyond 488, so 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the hundreds place for 4's was 89, but let me check that again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 -400 +1=89 numbers. So, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place there.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so 188 -98=90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just cross-verify with another approach to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nAnother way to count digit occurrences is to consider each digit place separately and calculate how many times each digit appears.\n\nFor the units place:\n\n- For 4's: Number of 4's in units place = floor(488/10) + (1 if 488%10 >=4 else 0). Wait, no, that's not exactly accurate. Alternatively, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is floor(n/10) + (1 if (n%10) >=d else 0), but adjusted for when d=0.\n\nWait, actually, for units digit, the count is simply (n + 9 - d) // 10, but I might be complicating it.\n\nAlternatively, for each digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place from 1 to n is:\n\ncount = (n // 10) * 1 + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.\n\nFor units digit, the number of times a digit d appears is equal to how many complete groups of 10 there are, plus 1 if the remaining digits include d.\n\nSo, for 4's in units place from 1 to 488:\n\nNumber of complete tens: 488 // 10 =48.\n\nIn each complete ten, 4 appears once, so 48 times.\n\nNow, the remaining numbers are 481-488, which is 8 numbers. In these, how many have 4 in the units place? Only 484, so 1 more. So, total 48 +1=49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly for 8's in units place: 488//10=48, so 48 times, plus in the remaining 481-488, 488 has 8 in units, so 1 more. Total 49.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in tens place:\n\nEach hundred contributes 10 times. So, from 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 more. So, total 50.\n\nSimilarly for 8's in tens place:\n\nFrom 1-400, 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 more. Total 49.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\n4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\n8 appears in 800-899, which is beyond 488, so 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 times. Additionally, 484 adds one more, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times in each hundred (e.g., 40-49). With 5 hundreds (1-400), that's 50 times. From 401-488, 440-449 adds another 10, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times. 488 adds one more, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears 10 times in each hundred, totaling 40 times. From 401-488, 480-488 adds 9 times, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit within 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by understanding how page numbers are structured and then count the occurrences of each digit.\n\nFirst, I know that page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, I need to consider all the digits in each page number and count how many times the digit 4 appears versus how many times 8 appears. The difference between these two counts will give me the answer.\n\nI think the best approach is to break down the problem by looking at each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That way, I can systematically count the number of 4's and 8's in each position.\n\nLet's start with the units place. For every 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 consecutive pages, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times a specific digit (like 4 or 8) appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then checking if there's any remainder to account for extra occurrences.\n\nWait, but the total number of pages is 488, which isn't a multiple of 10. So, I need to adjust for that. Let me calculate how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488 pages. That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. So, there are 48 complete sets of 10 pages, and then 8 extra pages (from 481 to 488). \n\nIn each complete set of 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does the digit 8. So, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 times 1, which is 48, and similarly, the number of 8's would also be 48. Now, I need to check the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488) to see if there are any additional 4's or 8's in the units place. \n\nLooking at pages 481 to 488, the units digits are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So, in these, the digit 4 appears once (page 484) and the digit 8 appears once (page 488). Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the total number of 8's is also 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that can't be right because 488 is included, so maybe I should check again.\n\nWait, no, from page 1 to 480, that's 480 pages, which is 48 sets of 10. Then pages 481 to 488 are 8 pages, so units digits 1 through 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, same count for units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place over 100 pages. So, for each digit, in the tens place, it appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n\nSince the book has 488 pages, let's see how many complete hundreds we have. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for 4 complete hundreds, the number of 4's in the tens place is 4 * 10 = 40, and the same for 8's, 40.\n\nNow, let's look at the remaining 88 pages (401-488). The tens digit here ranges from 0 (for 401-410) to 8 (for 480-488). So, we need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place in this range.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for pages 440-449, which is 10 pages. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for pages 480-488, but wait, 488 is the last page, so from 480-488, that's 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. Wait, actually, from 480 to 489 would be 10 pages, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 pages. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in this range.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for the tens digit 4, it's from 440 to 449, which is 10 pages. For the tens digit 8, it's from 480 to 488, which is 9 pages because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times in this remaining 88 pages.\n\nTherefore, total number of 4's in the tens place is 40 (from the complete hundreds) + 10 = 50, and 8's in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. So, in the first 400 pages, we have 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40 for each. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50, and 8's: 40 +9=49.\n\nOkay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 1 for 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? It's 89 times because every page from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400 to 488. So, the number of times 4 appears in the hundreds place is 488 - 400 +1 = 89 times.\n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit goes up to 4. There's no page where the hundreds digit is 8 because 800 is beyond 488. So, the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, the count of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, summarizing the hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's add up all the occurrences for each digit.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, let me check that again. Earlier, I thought the units place for 4 was 49 and for 8 was 49, but let me confirm.\n\nWait, no, in the units place, I had 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each, and then in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits were 1-8, so 4 appeared once (484) and 8 appeared once (488). So, units place: 48 +1=49 for 4, and 48 +1=49 for 8.\n\nIn the tens place, I had 40 from the first 400 pages, plus 10 from 440-449, making 50 for 4, and 40 from the first 400 pages, plus 9 from 480-488, making 49 for 8.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 89 for 4 and 0 for 8.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I did the hundreds place correctly. Let me think again. The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. So, how many pages is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nBut wait, in the hundreds place, the digit is only 4, so 89 times. For the digit 8, there's no page where the hundreds digit is 8, so 0.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's: 49 +50 +89=188, 8's:49 +49 +0=98. So, 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the hundreds place for 4 was 89, but maybe I should check if that's correct.\n\nWait, pages 400-488: that's 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the hundreds digit for each page. For example, from 1-99, hundreds digit is 0 (but we don't count 0 as a digit we're looking for). From 100-199, hundreds digit is 1. From 200-299, it's 2. From 300-399, it's 3. From 400-488, it's 4. So, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. From 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. For 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. So, in the tens place, 4's: 10, 8's:9.\n\nSo, adding to the previous counts:\n\nFor 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nFor 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because I thought the units place for 4's was 49 and for 8's was 49, but maybe I should double-check that.\n\nWait, from 1-488, the units digit cycles every 10 pages. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 and one 8. So, 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place: 48+1=49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct. The total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the hundreds place for 4's was 89, but maybe I should check if that's correct. Let me list some pages to see.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, each page has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 pages. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. The number of pages is 488 - 400 +1 =89. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct. The difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm going to try another approach to confirm.\n\nAlternative approach: count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately.\n\nUnits place:\n\nTotal pages:488\n\nNumber of times each digit appears in units place: floor(488/10)=48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once, 8 appears once.\n\nSo, 4's in units:48+1=49, 8's:48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach digit appears 10 times every 100 pages. So, for 488 pages, how many complete hundreds? 4 complete hundreds (1-400), and 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, 4 appears 10 times in tens place, 8 appears 10 times.\n\nSo, 4:4*10=40, 8:4*10=40.\n\nIn the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0-8.\n\nFor tens digit 4: pages 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, 10 times.\n\nFor tens digit 8: pages 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 9 times.\n\nThus, total 4's in tens place:40+10=50, 8's:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nAs before, 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. Pages 400-488: 488-400+1=89 pages, so 89 times 4 appears in hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nI think I'm confident now. The answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - 488 pages = 48 full sets of 10 pages + 8 extra pages.\n   - 4's: 48 + 1 (from 484) = 49.\n   - 8's: 48 + 1 (from 488) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - 488 pages = 4 full hundreds + 88 extra pages.\n   - 4's: 4*10 = 40 + 10 (440-449) = 50.\n   - 8's: 4*10 = 40 + 9 (480-488) = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have hundreds digit 4.\n   - 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages.\n   - 4's: 89.\n   - 8's: 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by considering how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number, right? So, pages 1 to 9 are single-digit, 10 to 99 are two-digit, and 100 to 488 are three-digit numbers. I think I should count the number of 4's and 8's in each of these ranges separately and then compare them.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the single-digit pages, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the only single-digit numbers are 1 through 9. The digit 4 appears once (page 4), and the digit 8 also appears once (page 8). So, in the single-digit pages, both 4 and 8 appear the same number of times. That means the difference here is zero. Okay, so far, so good.\n\nNext, let's move on to the two-digit pages, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I think I should consider each digit place separately to count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nStarting with the tens place in two-digit numbers. The tens digit can be from 1 to 9. For the tens place, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for pages 40 to 49. That's 10 pages, so 10 occurrences of the digit 4. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for pages 80 to 89, which is also 10 pages, so 10 occurrences of the digit 8. So, in the tens place of two-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times each.\n\nNow, let's look at the units place in two-digit numbers. For each set of ten pages (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set, the digit 4 appears once (like 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for 8 (like 18, 28, etc.). There are 9 sets of ten in the two-digit numbers (10-99), so that's 9 occurrences of 4 in the units place and 9 occurrences of 8 in the units place. \n\nWait, no, that's not right. From 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers, which is 9 sets of 10. So, for each digit, 4 and 8, in the units place, each appears 9 times. So, 9 times for 4 and 9 times for 8 in the units place.\n\nPutting it all together for two-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19 times. So, in two-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear 19 times each. So, the difference here is also zero. Hmm, so so far, single and two-digit pages have equal numbers of 4's and 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the three-digit pages, which are from 100 to 488. This seems a bit more complicated, so I'll have to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, let's note that the three-digit page numbers have a hundreds place, a tens place, and a units place. So, I'll need to consider each digit place separately again.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book has 488 pages. So, pages 100-199 have 1 in the hundreds place, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4.\n\nNow, let's count how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. That's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit only goes up to 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, let's consider the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be from 0 to 9, and each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in the tens place across the hundreds. But since our range goes up to 488, the last hundred (400-488) is shorter, so I need to be careful.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to break down the three-digit numbers into hundreds and then count the occurrences in the tens and units places within each hundred.\n\nSo, let's divide the three-digit numbers into four groups based on the hundreds digit: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nFirst, let's handle 100-199. In this range, the hundreds digit is 1, so we can ignore that for counting 4's and 8's. Now, looking at the tens and units places.\n\nIn the tens place for 100-199, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 100-109 have 0 in tens, 110-119 have 1, etc.). So, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (140-149), and the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (180-189).\n\nSimilarly, in the units place for 100-199, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the units place for each ten (e.g., 100,101,...,109 have 0-9 in units). So, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the units place (104,114,...,194), and the same for 8 (108,118,...,198).\n\nSo, in 100-199, the digit 4 appears 10 (tens) + 10 (units) = 20 times, and the same for 8: 20 times.\n\nNext, 200-299. Similar logic applies here. The hundreds digit is 2, so we don't consider that. The tens place: each digit 0-9 appears 10 times, so 4 appears 10 times (240-249) and 8 appears 10 times (280-289). In the units place, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times, so 4 appears 10 times (204,214,...,294) and 8 appears 10 times (208,218,...,298). So, again, 20 times each for 4 and 8 in 200-299.\n\nSimilarly, for 300-399, the same reasoning applies. Tens place: 4 appears 10 times (340-349), 8 appears 10 times (380-389). Units place: 4 appears 10 times (304,314,...,394), 8 appears 10 times (308,318,...,398). So, 20 times each for 4 and 8 in 300-399.\n\nNow, the last group is 400-488. This is a bit trickier because it's not a full hundred; it goes up to 488. So, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the hundreds digit is 4, so in the hundreds place, as we saw earlier, 4 appears 89 times (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's look at the tens place in 400-488. The tens digit can be from 0 to 8 because 488 is the last page. So, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nFor the tens place, each digit from 0 to 8 appears a certain number of times. Specifically, for each tens digit, the number of pages is 10 unless it's the last group. Wait, actually, from 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, for tens digits 0-7, each has 10 pages (e.g., 400-409, 410-419, etc.), but for tens digit 8, it's only 9 pages (480-488).\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see. The tens digit is 4 in the range 440-449. That's 10 pages, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, how about 8 in the tens place? The tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in 400-488. Each units digit from 0 to 9 appears a certain number of times, but again, we have to consider that the last group (480-488) only goes up to 8 in the units place.\n\nWait, maybe a better way is to calculate how many times each digit appears in the units place across the entire range 400-488.\n\nFirst, let's note that from 400 to 488, there are 89 pages. The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each tens group. So, for each complete set of ten pages, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place.\n\nSo, in the range 400-488, how many complete sets of ten are there? Let's see, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages. 89 divided by 10 is 8 with a remainder of 9. So, there are 8 complete sets of ten (400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479) and then an incomplete set from 480-488, which is 9 pages.\n\nIn each complete set of ten, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. So, for 8 complete sets, each digit appears 8 times. Then, in the incomplete set (480-488), the units digits go from 0 to 8, so each digit 0-8 appears once, and 9 doesn't appear.\n\nSo, for the units place, the digit 4 appears 8 times in the complete sets (once per set) and once in the incomplete set (484), so total 9 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 8 times in the complete sets and once in the incomplete set (488), so total 9 times.\n\nWait, let me check that again. For each complete set (400-409, etc.), the units digit 4 appears once per set, so 8 sets mean 8 times. Then, in 480-488, units digit 4 appears once (484), so total 9 times. Same for 8: 8 times in the complete sets, and once in 488, so 9 times.\n\nSo, in the units place for 400-488, 4 appears 9 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nPutting it all together for the three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n- Tens place: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 9 times.\n- Units place: 4 appears 9 times, 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total for three-digit numbers:\n- 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 108 times.\n- 8's: 0 (hundreds) + 9 (tens) + 9 (units) = 18 times.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Because in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times. In the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 9 times. So, 4's total is 89 +10 +9=108, and 8's total is 0 +9 +9=18. So, the difference in three-digit numbers is 108 - 18 = 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Because in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, which is a big chunk. So, 89 is just from the hundreds place, and then 10 and 9 from tens and units. So, yeah, 108 for 4's and 18 for 8's. So, 108 - 18 = 90 more 4's.\n\nNow, adding up all the ranges:\n\n- Single-digit: 4's =1, 8's=1. Difference=0.\n- Two-digit: 4's=19, 8's=19. Difference=0.\n- Three-digit: 4's=108, 8's=18. Difference=90.\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 0 + 90 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the three-digit counts. Let's go through it again.\n\nIn three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (from 400-488). 8 never appears here.\n- Tens place: 4 appears 10 times (440-449). 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n- Units place: 4 appears 9 times (once per each of 8 complete tens and once in the incomplete). Similarly, 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, 4's: 89 +10 +9=108.\n\n8's: 0 +9 +9=18.\n\nDifference: 108 -18=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought about the units place in three-digit numbers, I considered that from 400-488, which is 89 pages. The units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, for each complete ten, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. There are 8 complete tens (400-409 up to 470-479), so 8 times each for 4 and 8. Then, in the last partial ten (480-488), units digits go from 0-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units digits: 8 +1=9 for both 4 and 8.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, units place contributes 9 each.\n\nTens place: 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times because it's the last partial group.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, 4's total: 89 +10 +9=108.\n\n8's total: 0 +9 +9=18.\n\nDifference: 108 -18=90.\n\nOkay, that seems solid. So, the total number of 4's printed is 108, and 8's is 18, so 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the two-digit numbers. Earlier, I thought that in two-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear 19 times each. Let me confirm that.\n\nIn two-digit numbers (10-99):\n\n- Tens place: 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n- Units place: For each ten (10-19, 20-29, etc.), 4 and 8 each appear once. There are 9 tens groups (10-99), so 9 times each for units place.\n\nSo, total for 4: 10 (tens) +9 (units)=19.\n\nSame for 8:10 +9=19.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in single-digit, both appear once each.\n\nSo, total 4's:1 (single) +19 (two-digit) +108 (three-digit)=128.\n\nWait, wait, hold on. Wait, earlier I thought 4's were 108 in three-digit, but adding 1+19+108=128. But in the problem, we're only going up to 488, so maybe I made a mistake in the three-digit counts.\n\nWait, no, in the three-digit counts, I considered 100-488, which includes 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, the three-digit counts are correct as 108 for 4's and 18 for 8's.\n\nWait, but when I add up all the 4's:\n\n- Single-digit:1\n- Two-digit:19\n- Three-digit:108\nTotal 4's:1+19+108=128.\n\nSimilarly, 8's:\n\n- Single-digit:1\n- Two-digit:19\n- Three-digit:18\nTotal 8's:1+19+18=38.\n\nSo, the difference would be 128 -38=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference in three-digit was 90, but adding up all ranges, it's 90 as well.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count or miss anything.\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, 4 appears 108 times, and 8 appears 18 times. So, the difference in three-digit is 90. But when adding all ranges, the total 4's are 128, and 8's are 38, so difference is 90. That makes sense because the single and two-digit ranges had equal counts, so the difference comes entirely from the three-digit range.\n\nSo, the final answer is that there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) across all page ranges.\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - 4 appears once (page 4).\n   - 8 appears once (page 8).\n   - Difference: 0.\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - **Units place:** Each digit appears 9 times (one per ten-group).\n   - Total 4's: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - Total 8's: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - Difference: 0.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 appears 0 times.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times (440-449), 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears 9 times, 8 appears 9 times.\n   - Total 4's: 89 + 10 + 9 = 108.\n   - Total 8's: 0 + 9 + 9 = 18.\n   - Difference: 108 - 18 = 90.\n\n**Total counts:**\n- 4's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 108 (three-digit) = 128.\n- 8's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 18 (three-digit) = 38.\n- Difference: 128 - 38 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by understanding how page numbers are structured and then count the occurrences of each digit separately.\n\nFirst, I know that page numbers go from 1 to 488. Each page number is printed once, so I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to consider each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Maybe I should handle each position one by one for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in a sequence of numbers, right? So, in every block of 10 numbers, each digit appears once. For example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does the digit 8.\n\nNow, how many such blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times, once in each block, and then in the extra 8 numbers, 484 is one of them, so that's one more. So total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, each block of 10 has one 8, so 48 times, and in the extra 8 numbers, 488 is the last one, so that's another 8. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that seems the same as for 4. Hmm, but wait, 488 is included, so maybe I should check again.\n\nWait, from 1 to 480, there are 48 blocks of 10, so 48 times each digit appears in units place. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 8 appears once in 488. So, units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, 4 appears once in 484, so units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49. So, so far, both digits have 49 occurrences in the units place.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in a block of 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), etc., up to 9 (90-99). So, in each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, for the digit 4 in the tens place, in each hundred, it appears 10 times (40-49). Similarly, for the digit 8, it appears 10 times (80-89).\n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, we have four complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Then the last partial hundred is 401-488.\n\nWait, actually, 488 is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each of the four full hundreds, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49 in each hundred), so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place in each hundred (80-89), so 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, in the partial hundred from 401-488, let's check the tens place. The numbers go from 401 to 488. The tens digit here goes from 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), and 8 (481-488). Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the tens digit in 481-488 is 8, which is 8 times, but wait, from 481 to 488, that's 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears 8 times in this partial hundred.\n\nWait, but let me check: 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 numbers)\n411-420: tens digit 1 (10 numbers)\n421-430: tens digit 2 (10 numbers)\n431-440: tens digit 3 (10 numbers)\n441-450: tens digit 4 (10 numbers)\n451-460: tens digit 5 (10 numbers)\n461-470: tens digit 6 (10 numbers)\n471-480: tens digit 7 (10 numbers)\n481-488: tens digit 8 (8 numbers)\n\nSo, in the partial hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and the digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, adding to the previous counts:\n\nFor the digit 4 in tens place: 40 (from four full hundreds) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50 times.\n\nFor the digit 8 in tens place: 40 (from four full hundreds) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48 times.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me double-check. So, in each full hundred, 10 times for each digit in the tens place. So, four hundreds give 40 each. Then in the partial hundred, 441-450 adds another 10 for 4, and 481-488 adds 8 for 8.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 50, and 8's: 48.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, pages 1-99 have no hundreds digit, pages 100-199 have hundreds digit 1, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4.\n\nSo, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nThe digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the digit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, that makes sense because 488 is less than 800, so the hundreds digit only goes up to 4.\n\nSo, summarizing the hundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89 times\n- 8's: 0 times\n\nNow, let's add up all the occurrences for each digit.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nWait, let me check that addition: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Yes.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nWait, 49 + 48 is 97. So, 8's total 97.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The question asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the counts.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- For 4: 48 full decades (1-480) with 48 occurrences, plus 484 in 481-488, so 49. Correct.\n- For 8: 48 full decades, plus 488 in 481-488, so 49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For 4: 4 full hundreds (1-400) each contributing 10, so 40, plus 10 in 441-450, total 50. Correct.\n- For 8: 4 full hundreds contributing 40, plus 8 in 481-488, total 48. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- For 4: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89. Correct.\n- For 8: None, so 0. Correct.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me think again. Wait, when I counted the units place, I considered 488 pages, so from 1 to 488. Let me make sure that when I counted the units digit, I included 488 correctly.\n\nIn units place for 8's: in 488, the units digit is 8, so that's one occurrence in the extra 8 pages beyond 480. So, units place 8's are 49, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's, in the units place, 484 is the only 4 in the extra 8 pages, so that's correct too.\n\nIn the tens place, for 481-488, the tens digit is 8 for all 8 numbers, so that's 8 occurrences, correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, 89 occurrences, correct.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total units place 4's: 48 full decades (1-480) + 1 (484) = 49.\n   - Total units place 8's: 48 full decades + 1 (488) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times in every 100 numbers.\n   - Total tens place 4's: 4 full hundreds (1-400) * 10 = 40 + 10 (441-450) = 50.\n   - Total tens place 8's: 4 full hundreds * 10 = 40 + 8 (481-488) = 48.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 1-99: No hundreds digit.\n   - Pages 100-399: Hundreds digit 1, 2, 3.\n   - Pages 400-488: Hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n   - Hundreds digit 8: 0 times.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 97 = 91.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by understanding how page numbers are structured and then count the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each digit place separately.\n\nFirst, I think I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, I'll need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place. I'll do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each block of 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra numbers. In each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does the digit 8. So, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 times 1, which is 48, plus any extra 4's in the remaining 8 numbers. The remaining numbers after 480 would be 481 to 488. Looking at the units digits here: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, there's one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488). So, total 4's in units place would be 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's would be 48 + 1 = 49 as well. Wait, so in units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, from 1 to 488, how many hundreds are there? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and the same for 8 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4 times 10, which is 40 for both 4 and 8. Now, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. Let me check how many times 4 and 8 appear here.\n\nIn the tens place from 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 481-488). So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 440-449, which is 10 times, but wait, 440-449 is part of 401-488, right? So that's 10 occurrences. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, that's 9 occurrences (480-488). Wait, no, actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 times. Wait, but 480 is part of the 401-488 range, so yes, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 times. So, for the tens place in the remaining 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times. Therefore, total for tens place: 4's would be 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's would be 40 + 9 = 49. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, onto the hundreds place. The hundreds digit changes every 100 pages. From 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's there. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's. From 200-299, it's 2, same thing. From 300-399, it's 3. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. As for 8, does the hundreds digit ever reach 8? The book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4, and before that, it's 3. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, total for hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0.\n\nNow, adding up all the occurrences:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nIn the units place, I had 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 484 is the only 4, and 488 is the only 8. So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, 440-449 is 10 numbers where tens digit is 4, and 480-488 is 9 numbers where tens digit is 8. So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's. That adds up.\n\nIn the hundreds place, only from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 appears, and 0 times for 8. So, total 4's: 89, 8's: 0.\n\nAdding them up: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 for 4's. For 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Maybe I should recount the tens place in the 401-488 range. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but only up to 488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does each occur? For 0: 401-410 is 10 numbers, but wait, 401-410 is 10 numbers, but 488 is the last page, so 481-488 is only 8 numbers, but wait no, 401-488 is 88 numbers, so the tens digits from 0 to 8 each occur 10 times except for the last one, which occurs 8 times? Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, 401-488 is 88 numbers. The tens digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 401-410: tens digit 0, 10 numbers. 411-420: tens digit 1, 10 numbers. Similarly up to 471-480: tens digit 7, 10 numbers. Then, 481-490 would be tens digit 8, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in the tens place from 401-488, the digit 8 appears 8 times, not 9. Wait, that contradicts what I thought earlier. So, I think I made a mistake there.\n\nSo, in the tens place, from 401-488:\n\n- Tens digit 0: 401-410 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 1: 411-420 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 2: 421-430 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 3: 431-440 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 4: 441-450 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 5: 451-460 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 6: 461-470 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 7: 471-480 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 8: 481-488 \u2192 8 numbers\n\nSo, the digit 8 in the tens place appears 8 times, not 9. Therefore, in the tens place, the 4's would be 10 times (from 440-449) and 8's would be 8 times (from 480-488). So, adding to the previous 40 each from the complete hundreds:\n\n- 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 8's in tens place: 40 + 8 = 48\n\nWait, so previously I thought 8's in the tens place were 49, but now it's 48. That changes things.\n\nSo, let me recalculate:\n\nTotal 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nTotal 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 48\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 90, but now I'm getting 91. Hmm, where did I go wrong?\n\nLet me check the tens place again. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, right? So, that's 8 times. So, in the tens place, 8's are 40 (from the first 400) + 8 = 48.\n\nBut wait, in the first 400 pages, how many 8's in the tens place? Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place, so 4 hundreds would give 40 for each digit, including 8. So, 40 occurrences of 8 in the tens place in the first 400 pages. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs 8 times, so total 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, from 401-488, it's 10 times (440-449). So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference was 90, but now it's 91. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial count of the tens place in the 401-488 range. Let me confirm.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 481-488, which is 8 numbers: 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, that's 8 numbers, so 8 times. Therefore, 8's in the tens place: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nSimilarly, 4's in the tens place: from 401-488, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but I think I might have miscalculated the units place. Let me check that again.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full cycles with 8 remaining numbers.\n\nIn each cycle, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, 48 times each. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nSo, the units place contributes 49 each.\n\nTens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 48.\n\nHundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, so the correct difference is 91, not 90. I think I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the tens place for 8's, where I thought it was 49 instead of 48. So, the correct answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make another mistake. Let me recount the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, right? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages, so 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nAnd for 8's in the hundreds place, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 occurrences. Correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nSo, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought it was 90. Let me check the tens place again. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times. So, in the tens place, 8's are 40 (from the first 400 pages) + 8 = 48. That seems correct.\n\nYes, so the difference is 91.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by understanding how page numbers are structured and how often the digits 4 and 8 appear in each position.\n\nFirst, I think I should consider the different positions in the page numbers: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers can be 1-digit, 2-digit, or 3-digit numbers. But wait, 488 is a 3-digit number, so the page numbers range from 1 to 488. That means the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, but actually, since we start at page 1, the hundreds digit starts at 0 (for pages 1-99), then 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488). \n\nI think I should count the number of times 4 appears in each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately and then do the same for 8. Then, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484.\n   - Since the book has 488 pages, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups and then 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n   - In each complete group of 10, there's one 4 in the units place. So that's 48 times.\n   - Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. Does 4 appear here? Yes, at 484. So that's one more 4.\n   - Total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - For every 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449.\n   - How many complete groups of 100 are there in 488? There are 4 complete groups (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 88 more pages (400-488).\n   - Each complete group contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 groups \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Now, in the remaining 88 pages (400-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. Let's see how many times 4 appears in the tens place here.\n   - From 400-488, the tens digit is 0 (400-409), 1 (410-419), 2 (420-429), 3 (430-439), 4 (440-449), 5 (450-459), 6 (460-469), 7 (470-479), and 8 (480-488).\n   - So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's another 10 4's.\n   - Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's 10 more.\n   - So total 4's in the tens place: 40 (from the four complete groups) + 10 (from the remaining 88) = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488.\n   - How many numbers are there from 400-488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these numbers, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n   - Wait, but earlier when I was counting tens and units, I considered up to 488, so this is correct. So 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each, so 89 times.\n\nSo total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, I had 40 from the first four hundreds, and then 10 more from 440-449, so 50 total. That seems right.\n\nIn the units place, 48 groups of 10 up to 480, giving 48 4's, plus 484, which is one more, so 49 total. That adds up.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, but let me check: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99, plus 89 (hundreds) = 188. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing 1 8, so 48.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers are 481-488. The units digits here are 1-8, so 8 appears once at 488.\n   - So total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - For every 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place, e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - There are 4 complete hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 8's in the tens place: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (400-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. How many times does 8 appear in the tens place here?\n   - The tens digit is 8 in 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So that's 9 8's in the tens place.\n   - So total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So the hundreds digit is never 8.\n   - So 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, totaling 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 188\n\nTotal 8's: 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counting to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, checking the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 groups of 10 up to 480, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then 484 adds one more, so 49. That seems correct.\n- Tens place: 40 from the first four hundreds, plus 10 from 440-449, so 50. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 89 from 400-488. Correct.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 groups of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then 488 adds one more, so 49. Correct.\n- Tens place: 40 from the first four hundreds, plus 9 from 480-488, so 49. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 0. Correct.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check again.\n\nIn the tens place for 8's, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So that's 9 times, right? So 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more 4's. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the hundreds place again. For 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nFor 8's, in the hundreds place, since the book ends at 488, there are no pages from 800-899, so 0 8's in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo, the total counts seem accurate. Therefore, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a large number. Let me try another approach to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor units place:\n\n- For both 4 and 8, in every 10 numbers, each digit appears once. So from 1 to 488, how many times does each digit appear in the units place?\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8). So each digit (0-9) appears 48 times in the units place, except for the last partial group.\n\nBut wait, actually, for digits 1-9, each appears 48 times in the units place, and then in the partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more, and 4 appears once more (at 484).\n\nSo units place:\n\n- 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n- 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\nThat's correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For each digit, in the tens place, each digit appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So from 0-99, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly for 100-199, 200-299, etc.\n\nSo for 4's in the tens place:\n\n- From 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 times\n- From 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 times\n- From 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 times\n- From 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 times\n- From 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 times (since 440-449 is within 400-488)\n- So total 4's in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 10 = 50\n\nFor 8's in the tens place:\n\n- From 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 times\n- From 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 times\n- From 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 times\n- From 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 times\n- From 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 times (since 480-488 is 9 numbers)\n- So total 8's in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49\n\nThat's correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- For 4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n- For 8's: No pages, so 0.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nOkay, that seems consistent. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting '4's:**\n   - **Units Place:** In every block of 10 numbers, '4' appears once. There are 48 complete blocks (480 numbers), contributing 48 '4's. The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include one more '4' at 484. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** In every block of 100, '4' appears 10 times in the tens place. Four complete blocks (0-399) give 40 '4's. The remaining 88 numbers (400-488) include another 10 '4's (440-449). Total: 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, '4' appears in the hundreds place 89 times. Total: 89.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting '8's:**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to '4's, '8' appears once every 10 numbers. 48 complete blocks give 48 '8's, plus one more at 488. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** In every block of 100, '8' appears 10 times. Four complete blocks give 40 '8's. The remaining 88 numbers include '8's in 480-488, contributing 9 more. Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No '8's since the book ends at 488. Total: 0.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** Subtract the total '8's from '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by understanding how page numbers are structured and then count the occurrences of 4's and 8's separately.\n\nFirst, I know that page numbers go from 1 to 488. Each page number is printed once, so I need to look at each digit in these numbers. The digits can be in the units place, the tens place, or the hundreds place. Since 488 is a three-digit number, I should consider each digit position separately.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place one by one.\n\n1. **Units place:** For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So in every block of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n\nSince 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, that means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then a partial block of 8 pages. In each complete block, there's one 4 in the units place. So that's 48 times. Now, in the partial block from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included. That adds one more 4. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me check that again. If I have 488 pages, the number of complete tens is 48 because 48*10=480, and then 8 more pages. So from 1 to 480, there are 48 blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That's 48. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So 484 has a 4 in the units place, so that's one more. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, for the tens digit, the 4 appears in a block of 100 pages. Specifically, in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are in 488 pages.\n\nStarting from 40-49: that's 10 pages, contributing 10 4's in the tens place.\n\nThen 140-149: another 10.\n\n240-249: another 10.\n\n340-349: another 10.\n\n440-449: another 10.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50.\n\nWait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 is another 10, 340-349 is another 10, and 440-449 is another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each with 10 4's in the tens place, totaling 50.\n\nWait, but does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488, so yes, that's correct.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, for the hundreds digit. The 4 in the hundreds place appears from page 400 to 488. So how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences.\n\nWait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-499, but since the book ends at 488, it's 400-488. So the number of times 4 appears in the hundreds place is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nWait, but 400 is the first page with 4 in the hundreds place, and 488 is the last. So that's correct, 89 times.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds:\n\n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, units place: 48 blocks of 10, each contributing 1, so 48, plus one more in 484, so 49. That's correct.\n\nTens place: 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 89. Correct.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears once every 10 pages. So from 1 to 488, how many 8's in the units place?\n\nNumber of complete tens: 48, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the partial block from 481 to 488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included. So that's one more 8. So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so the units digit goes up to 8, so yes, 488 is included, so one more 8 in the units place. So 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is the relevant range.\n\nSo let's count how many blocks:\n\n- 80-89: 10 pages, contributing 10 8's in the tens place.\n- 180-189: another 10.\n- 280-289: another 10.\n- 380-389: another 10.\n- 480-488: how many? From 480 to 488, that's 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So in the tens place, each of these has an 8, so 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but wait: 480-489 would be a full block of 10, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 pages. So the number of 8's in the tens place is:\n\nFor the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributes 10, so 4*10=40. Then, the last block from 480-488 contributes 9. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me double-check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 8 in the hundreds place. Wait, the hundreds digit can only be 4 in this book because the book goes up to 488. So the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, and before that, it's 1, 2, 3, etc., but never 8. So the hundreds place never has an 8. So the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds:\n\n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, so 4's total 188 and 8's total 98. So the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me check my counts again.\n\nWait, for 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:98.\n\nSo difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 8's. Let me recount:\n\nIn the tens place, 8's appear in:\n\n- 80-89: 10\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 (since 480 to 488 is 9 pages: 480,481,...,488)\n\nSo that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place:\n\n- 40-49:10\n- 140-149:10\n- 240-249:10\n- 340-349:10\n- 440-449:10\nSo that's 5 blocks, each 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes.\n\nAnd hundreds place for 4's: 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, 4's:188, 8's:98, difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when I count the units place, I have 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, and then in the last partial ten (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once at 484. So 48+1=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, and the last partial ten (481-488) has 488, which is another 8 in the units place. So 48+1=49. Correct.\n\nI think that's right. So the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because 4's in the hundreds place are 89, which is a significant number, and that's only for 4's. 8's don't have any in the hundreds place, so that's a big difference.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check: from 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So yes, 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89 4's there.\n\nSo, yes, I think my calculations are correct. So the number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's the answer. So the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit '4' and '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting '4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:** \n   - Each block of 10 pages contributes one '4'. \n   - There are 48 complete blocks (480 pages) and one partial block (481-488). \n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:** \n   - Each block of 100 pages contributes 10 '4's in the tens place. \n   - There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). \n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:** \n   - Pages 400-488 each have a '4' in the hundreds place. \n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting '8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:** \n   - Each block of 10 pages contributes one '8'. \n   - There are 48 complete blocks and one partial block (481-488). \n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:** \n   - Each block of 100 pages contributes 10 '8's in the tens place. \n   - There are 4 complete blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one partial block (480-488). \n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:** \n   - No '8's since the book ends at 488. \n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of '4's printed exceeds the number of '8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by understanding how page numbers are structured and then count the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each digit place separately.\n\nFirst, I think I should consider the page numbers as three-digit numbers, even though some are just one or two digits. So, pages 1-9 are single-digit, 10-99 are two-digit, and 100-488 are three-digit. Maybe it's easier to break the counting into units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nLet me start by calculating how many times the digit 4 appears in each place. Then, I'll do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. Units place: For every 10 consecutive pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from page 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4. So that's 48 times. But wait, from 1 to 488, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, actually, the units digit cycles 48 times, each contributing a 4 once, so 48 times. But wait, in 488, the units digit is 8, so maybe the last 4 in the units place is at 484. So, yes, 48 times for the units place.\n\n2. Tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place every 100 pages, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 pages where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many complete sets we have. From 40-49 is 10 pages, 140-149 is another 10, and so on up to 440-449. That's 5 sets of 10 pages each, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 440-449 is within 488. So, 5 sets, so 50 times.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488. That's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages, so that's 89 times.\n\nAdding up the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. Units place: Similar to 4, every 10 pages, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. So, 48 times. But wait, does 488 include an extra 8? Yes, the last page is 488, so the units digit is 8, which would be the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is the 49th set because 488 is the 488th page, so 488/10 is 48.8, meaning 48 full sets (each contributing one 8) and then the 49th set starts at 480 and ends at 488, which is 9 pages. So, in the units place, 48 times from 1-480, and then one more at 488. So total 49 times? Wait, no, because from 1-480, it's 48 times, and then 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 times.\n\n2. Tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, each of the first four ranges (80-89, etc.) has 10 pages, and the last one has 9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for those 9 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 49 times.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only in pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the units place for 8. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Every 10 pages, so 48 full cycles (1-480) give 48 eights, and then 488 is the 49th. So yes, 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, 80-89 is 10 pages, 180-189 another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9 pages. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nNow, total 4's were 187, and total 8's are 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's. Let me go through each place again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits place: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4. So, 48 times. But wait, does 488 include a 4 in the units place? No, because 488 ends with 8. So, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, units place for 4 is 48.\n\nTens place: The ranges are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 pages, so 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5*10=50.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus the 488 which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49.\n\nTens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 +49=98.\n\nSo, 187 -98=89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I thought about the units place for 4, I considered 488 as not contributing a 4, but for 8, it does contribute. So, maybe that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as from 1 to 488 inclusive, how many times does 4 appear in each digit.\n\nAnother way is to calculate for each digit place:\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is less than 4, so no extra. So, 48.\n\nNumber of 8's: floor(488/10) =48, but since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is equal to 8, so we add 1. So, 48 +1=49.\n\nFor tens digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100) =4, which is 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 4*10=40. But wait, in the hundreds place, when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can go up to 8. So, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, total 5 sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). So, 5*10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place: floor(488/100)=4, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place (80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4*10=40. But then, in the last hundred (400-488), the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, total 4*10 +9=49.\n\nFor hundreds digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nNumber of 8's: 0, since the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, total 4's: 48 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=187.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nDifference:187-98=89.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - Every 10 pages, 4 appears once.  \n   - Total sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8).  \n   - Occurrences: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10 occurrences.  \n   - Total ranges: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).  \n   - Occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 4 appears from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages.  \n   - Occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - Every 10 pages, 8 appears once.  \n   - Total sets of 10: 48.  \n   - Additionally, page 488 contributes one more 8.  \n   - Occurrences: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.  \n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, except the last one (480-488) which has 9.  \n   - Total ranges: 5 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488).  \n   - Occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.  \n   - Occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**  \n187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe digit 4 is printed 89 more times than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by considering how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nFirst, I think I should separate the problem into looking at the units place and the tens place because both 4 and 8 can appear in either. Maybe I should calculate how many times each digit appears in the units place and then in the tens place, and then add those together. That makes sense because the hundreds place only goes up to 4, and since 488 is less than 500, the hundreds digit is either 1, 2, 3, or 4. But 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place here, so I don't need to worry about that for the 8's.\n\nLet me start with the 4's. I'll first calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So in each set of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. How many full sets of 10 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets, each contributing one 4. That gives me 48 fours. But wait, in the last partial set, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear there. So, 48 fours in the units place.\n\nNow, for the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each block of 100 has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 4, right? For example, from 40-49, 140-149, etc. How many such blocks are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full blocks, each contributing 10 fours. That's 4 times 10, which is 40 fours. But wait, in the last partial block, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in the numbers 440-449. That's another 10 fours. So actually, it's 4 full blocks plus one more block, making it 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. Wait, that can't be right because 488 is less than 500, so the last block is 400-488, which is only 89 numbers. So the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So the total number of fours in the tens place is 5 times 10, which is 50. Wait, no, because 488 is less than 500, so the hundreds digit is 4 only up to 488. So how many times does the tens digit 4 occur? Let's see: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So 5 times 10 is 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nSo total fours would be units place (48) plus tens place (50), totaling 98 fours. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake here because when I calculated the units place, I considered 48 full sets of 10, but actually, from 1 to 488, the number of units digits is 488, so the number of times 4 appears in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48 times, plus any extra if 488's units digit is 4 or higher. But since 488 ends with 8, the units digit 4 would have occurred 48 times. So that part seems correct.\n\nNow, for the 8's. Let me do the same process. Starting with the units place. Every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's floor(488/10) = 48 times. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. But in the last partial set, from 481 to 488, the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once more. So total units place 8's would be 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nNow, the tens place for 8's. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each block of 100 has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 8, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. How many such blocks are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full blocks, each contributing 10 eights. That's 4 times 10 = 40 eights. Now, in the last partial block, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So that's 9 eights in the tens place. Therefore, total tens place eights are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me check again. The tens digit cycles every 100, so in each 100 numbers, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers. So from 1-100, it's 80-89, that's 10. From 101-200, it's 180-189, another 10. Similarly, 280-289 and 380-389, each 10. So that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights, totaling 40. Now, in the last block, 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So total tens place eights are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo total eights in the tens place are 49. Now, adding the units place eights, which were 49, so total eights in the entire page numbers would be 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98 eights.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking how many more 4's than 8's. If both are 98, the difference would be zero. That seems unlikely. Maybe I made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me double-check the units place for 8's. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 8,18,28,...,488. So how many terms are there? The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The common difference is 10. So the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, I had 49 eights. So total eights are 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but for the fours, I had 48 in the units and 50 in the tens, totaling 98 fours. So both 4's and 8's appear 98 times each, so the difference would be zero. But the problem says \"how many more 4's are printed than 8's,\" so maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the tens place for fours. Let me check that again. For fours in the tens place, it's 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. That's correct because 440-449 is within 488, so it's valid.\n\nBut for the eights in the tens place, I have 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. But in the fours case, I had 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's 10 fours in the last partial block, whereas for eights, it's 9 eights in the last partial block. So that's why the eights in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49, while the fours in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, no, I think I confused the blocks.\n\nWait, let me clarify. For fours in the tens place, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5 x 10 = 50 fours.\n\nFor eights in the tens place, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five blocks, but the last block only has 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So total eights in tens place are 4 x 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, fours in tens place: 50, eights in tens place: 49.\n\nNow, for units place, fours: 48, eights: 49.\n\nSo total fours: 48 + 50 = 98.\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, so that means the number of 4's and 8's printed are equal, so the difference is zero. But that seems odd because the problem is asking how many more 4's than 8's, implying there is a difference. Maybe I made a mistake in counting somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the units place for fours. Let me check again. Units place fours: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. The last term is 484 because 488 ends with 8, so the last 4 in units place is 484.\n\nSo the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that contradicts my earlier count. Wait, so if I'm counting units place fours, from 4 to 484, step 10, that's 49 numbers. But earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, maybe I was wrong earlier.\n\nWait, let's think differently. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n can be calculated as floor((n + 1)/10). So for n=488, floor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10) = 48. So 48 times. But when I list them, 4,14,24,...,484, that's 48 terms because 484 is the 48th term. Wait, no: 4 is the first, 14 the second, ..., 484 is the (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49th term. So that's 49 times. So I think my initial count was wrong. It should be 49 fours in the units place, not 48.\n\nWait, so that changes things. Let me recalculate.\n\nUnits place fours: 49.\n\nTens place fours: 50.\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 = 99.\n\nUnits place eights: 49.\n\nTens place eights: 49.\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo now, the number of fours is 99, and the number of eights is 98. So the difference is 99 - 98 = 1. So there is one more 4 than 8.\n\nWait, that seems more plausible. So where did I go wrong earlier? I think I made a mistake in the units place count for fours. Initially, I thought it was 48, but upon recounting, it's 49. So let's correct that.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Units place fours: 49\n- Tens place fours: 50\n- Total fours: 99\n\n- Units place eights: 49\n- Tens place eights: 49\n- Total eights: 98\n\nDifference: 99 - 98 = 1.\n\nSo, there is one more 4 printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any other mistakes. Let me verify the units place fours again. The numbers where the units digit is 4 are 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there? The nth term can be found by 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, 10(n-1) = 480 => n-1 = 48 => n=49. So yes, 49 terms. So units place fours: 49.\n\nSimilarly, for units place eights: 8,18,28,...,488. The last term is 488, so the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So units place eights: 49.\n\nTens place fours: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours.\n\nTens place eights: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. That's five blocks, but the last block only has 9 numbers (480-488), so 4 blocks with 10 eights and one with 9, totaling 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights.\n\nSo total fours: 49 + 50 = 99.\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 99 - 98 = 1.\n\nSo, the answer should be 1 more 4 than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I considered the hundreds place correctly. The hundreds digit for 488 is 4, so in the hundreds place, 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 times. But 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all because the book ends at 488. So, do I need to consider the hundreds place for fours?\n\nWait, in my earlier count, I didn't include the hundreds place because I was only considering units and tens. But wait, 4 can appear in the hundreds place as well. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 numbers. So, that's 89 additional fours in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, that changes everything. I completely forgot about the hundreds place. So, I need to add those 89 fours to my total.\n\nSo, let's recalculate:\n\nUnits place fours: 49\n\nTens place fours: 50\n\nHundreds place fours: 89 (from 400-488)\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that's a lot more. Now, for eights, the hundreds digit never is 8 because the book ends at 488, so hundreds digit is only 1,2,3,4. So, eights only appear in units and tens places, as I previously calculated.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nSo, total fours: 188, total eights: 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that's a big difference. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by not considering the hundreds place for fours. So, the correct approach is to consider all three places: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nLet me structure this properly.\n\nFor each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n1. Units place:\n\nAs before, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is floor((488 + 1)/10) = 48.9, so 48 times? Wait, no, earlier I found it was 49. Wait, let me use the formula correctly.\n\nThe formula for the number of times digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is floor((n)/10) + 1 if the units digit of n is >= d, else floor((n)/10).\n\nWait, n=488, d=4.\n\nfloor(488/10) = 48. The units digit of 488 is 8, which is >=4, so add 1. So units place fours: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for eights:\n\nfloor(488/10) = 48, units digit 8 >=8, so add 1. Units place eights: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place:\n\nFor tens digit 4:\n\nEach block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49). The number of complete blocks is floor(488/100) = 4. Each contributes 10 fours. So 4*10=40.\n\nNow, in the incomplete block (400-488), the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nFor tens digit 8:\n\nSimilarly, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (e.g., 80-89). 4 blocks contribute 4*10=40.\n\nIn the incomplete block (400-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\n\nFor hundreds digit 4:\n\nFrom 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. The number of such numbers is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, hundreds place fours: 89.\n\nFor hundreds digit 8:\n\nSince the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So hundreds place eights: 0.\n\nNow, summing up:\n\nTotal fours:\n\nUnits: 49\n\nTens: 50\n\nHundreds: 89\n\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal eights:\n\nUnits: 49\n\nTens: 49\n\nHundreds: 0\n\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n\nWait, that seems correct now. I initially forgot about the hundreds place, which significantly increases the count of fours. So the final answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **4's:** Occur once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, this happens 49 times.\n   - **8's:** Similarly, occur 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - **4's:** Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences. With five blocks (including the partial block 440-449), totaling 50 times.\n   - **8's:** Each block of 100 contributes 10 occurrences, with the last block contributing 9, totaling 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **4's:** From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, occurring 89 times.\n   - **8's:** Never appears in the hundreds place, so 0 times.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately, like units and tens, since page numbers can have one, two, or three digits.\n\nFirst, I think I should consider how many times each digit appears in the units place and then in the tens place. Wait, but the book has 488 pages, so the page numbers go from 1 to 488. That means the page numbers can be one-digit (1-9), two-digit (10-99), or three-digit (100-488). \n\nLet me start by counting how many 4's appear in the units place. For the units digit, every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once. So from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That would be 48 times 1, so 48 fours. But wait, the 49th set would be from 480 to 488, and in that, the units digit 4 appears once in 484. So total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, so 480 to 488 includes 484, so that's one more 4. So units digit 4's are 49.\n\nNow, for the tens place. The tens digit is 4 in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five ranges, so 5 times 10 is 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So tens digit 4's are 50.\n\nSo total 4's would be units digit 49 plus tens digit 50, which is 99. Hmm, but wait, when I count 440-449, the tens digit is 4, but the units digit is also 4 in 444. So does that mean I'm double-counting 444? No, because when I count units digits, I included 444 as one of the 49 units digit 4's, and when I count tens digits, I included it as one of the 50 tens digit 4's. So each occurrence is counted separately, so that's correct. So total 4's are 49 + 50 = 99.\n\nWait, but wait, 440-449 is 10 pages, so 440, 441, ..., 449. So that's 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 50. That seems right.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8. Starting with the units place. Every 10 numbers, the units digit is 8 once. So from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. So 48 times 1 is 48. But then, in the last partial set from 480 to 488, the units digit 8 appears in 488. So that's one more, making it 49 units digit 8's.\n\nNow, for the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-489 would only be up to 488. So each of these ranges is 10 numbers, except maybe the last one. Let's check.\n\nFrom 80-89: 10 numbers, tens digit 8.\n\n180-189: 10 numbers.\n\n280-289: 10 numbers.\n\n380-389: 10 numbers.\n\n480-488: Hmm, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, right? Because 488 is the last page. So 480, 481, ..., 488 is 9 numbers. So in the tens place, 480-488 has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8.\n\nSo how many 8's in the tens place? Let's see: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total is 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49.\n\nSo total 8's in the tens place are 49.\n\nNow, what about the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 in the range 800-899, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 800-899 doesn't exist here. So hundreds digit 8's are zero.\n\nSo total 8's would be units digit 49 plus tens digit 49, which is 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Units digit 8's: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. So 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in 488, the units digit is 8, so that's one more, making it 49. So units digit 8's: 49.\n\nTens digit 8's: as I calculated, 49. So total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought the hundreds digit 8's are zero because the book only goes up to 488. So that's correct.\n\nNow, total 4's are 99, total 8's are 98. So the difference is 99 - 98 = 1. So there's one more 4 than 8.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me recount the 4's and 8's.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units digit. So 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial set, from 480 to 488, the units digit 4 appears once at 484. So units digit 4's: 48 +1 =49.\n\nTens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers, so 5 ranges, 10 each, so 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So tens digit 4's: 50.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 +50=99.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: same as before, 49.\n\nTens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. That's 5 ranges, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So 10 +10 +10 +10 +9=49.\n\nTotal 8's:49 +49=98.\n\nSo difference is 99-98=1.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check again.\n\nFrom 80-89: 10 numbers.\n\n180-189:10.\n\n280-289:10.\n\n380-389:10.\n\n480-488:9.\n\nSo 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but what about the hundreds place? For 8's, the hundreds digit would be 8 in 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in 800-899. So hundreds digit 8's:0.\n\nSo total 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nAnd 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +0=99.\n\nSo the difference is 99-98=1.\n\nWait, but I feel like I might be missing something. Let me try another approach.\n\nAnother way is to count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately.\n\nStarting with the units digit:\n\nFor 4's: In each block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 /10=48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), 484 has a 4 in the units place, so that's one more. So total units digit 4's:48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's: same calculation. 488/10=48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48. Then, in the last partial block, 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So total units digit 8's:48+1=49.\n\nNow, tens digit:\n\nFor 4's: The tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So 5*10=50.\n\nFor 8's: The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers, so that's 9. So total tens digit 8's:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds digit:\n\nFor 4's: The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. So in the hundreds place, each of these 89 numbers has a 4. So that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, wait a minute, I didn't consider the hundreds place for 4's earlier. Oh no, I think I missed that. So in my initial calculation, I only considered units and tens places for 4's, but the hundreds place also has 4's from 400-488.\n\nSo that's an error. So let me correct that.\n\nSo, for 4's:\n\nUnits digit:49.\n\nTens digit:50.\n\nHundreds digit: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89.\n\nSo total 4's:49 +50 +89= 188.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier I thought it was 99, but now it's 188. I must have made a mistake earlier by not considering the hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, the hundreds digit is 8 only in 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total 8's remain the same: units digit 49, tens digit 49, hundreds digit 0, so total 98.\n\nWait, so the total 4's are 188 and 8's are 98, so the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, that's a big difference. So I think my initial approach was wrong because I didn't consider the hundreds place for 4's.\n\nLet me verify again.\n\nSo, page numbers go up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4 in pages 400-488. That's 89 pages, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 4's.\n\nThen, in the tens place, 4's appear in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so 5 ranges, 10 each, so 50.\n\nIn the units place, 4's appear every 10 numbers, so 488/10=48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus one more in 484, so 49.\n\nSo total 4's:89 +50 +49=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nHundreds digit: none, since the book ends at 488.\n\nTens digit: as before, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40, and the last range has 9 numbers, so 40+9=49.\n\nUnits digit: same as before, 49.\n\nSo total 8's:49 +49=98.\n\nSo the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, that's a big difference from my initial calculation. So I think I made a mistake earlier by not considering the hundreds place for 4's.\n\nSo the correct answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: from 400 to 488, inclusive. So 488-400+1=89 pages. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89 4's.\n\nTens place for 4's: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10.

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately\u2014like units, tens, hundreds\u2014and count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nFirst, let's think about the units place. For every 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 also appears once. So, for each 10 pages, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Now, how many full sets of 10 pages do we have in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 full sets, each contributing one 4 and one 8. That would give 48 fours and 48 eights in the units place. But wait, after page 480, there are 8 more pages (481 to 488), so in the units place, we have 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, in these 8 pages, the units digits are 1 through 8. That means there's one more 8 in the units place (page 488) but no additional 4. So, units place gives us 48 fours and 49 eights. Wait, but hold on, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate. From 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8. So that's 48 each. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, 4 doesn't appear again, but 8 appears once more on page 488. So, total units digits: 48 fours and 49 eights.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for example, in pages 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place per hundred. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, it appears 10 times in each hundred. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times in each hundred.\n\nNow, how many hundreds do we have in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). Let's calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nIn each full hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.), the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times. Since there are 4 full hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 fours and 4*10 = 40 eights in the tens place from the full hundreds.\n\nNow, let's look at the remaining 88 pages (401-488). The tens digit in this range goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times in 440-449, and 8 appears 10 times in 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 times, not 10. Hmm, so maybe I need to adjust that.\n\nWait, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear? For tens digit 0: pages 401-410, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. Similarly, tens digit 1: 411-420, 10 times. This continues up to tens digit 8: 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens digits: 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 = 50 fours, and 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 49 eights. So, in the tens place, 50 fours and 49 eights.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. From 1-400, there are 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place, so 40 each. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total tens digits: 40+10=50 fours, and 40+9=49 eights. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and so on. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488, which is 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488 and never 8. So, in the hundreds place, 8 appears 0 times, while 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, let me check that. Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0. Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1. 200-299: 2. 300-399:3. 400-488:4. So, yes, 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 fours. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 48 (from 1-480) + 0 (481-488) = 48\nWait, no, earlier I thought units place had 48 fours, but then I realized that from 481-488, units digit doesn't add any more fours, but adds one more eight. Wait, no, in the units place, from 1-480, there are 48 fours and 48 eights. Then from 481-488, units digits are 1-8, so one more eight on page 488, making units place total 48 fours and 49 eights. So, units place: 48 fours.\n\nTens place: 50 fours.\n\nHundreds place: 89 fours.\n\nSo total fours: 48 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 48+50=98, 98+89=187.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Wait, is that correct? Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the units place, from 1-488, how many fours? Every 10 pages, one four. So 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 fours in the units place, and an extra 8 in the units place on page 488.\n\nIn the tens place, from 1-488, how many fours? Each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 full hundreds would be 40, and then in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449). So 40+10=50 fours in the tens place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n\nSo total fours: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49 eights (48 from 1-480, plus one more on 488).\n\nTens place: 49 eights (40 from full hundreds, plus 9 from 480-488).\n\nHundreds place: 0 eights.\n\nSo total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, so 187 fours and 98 eights. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider each digit place separately and sum them up.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the tens place for the partial hundred. Let me think again.\n\nIn the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8.\n\nFor each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear?\n\n- Tens digit 0: 401-410 \u2192 10 pages\n- Tens digit 1: 411-420 \u2192 10 pages\n- Tens digit 2: 421-430 \u219210\n- Tens digit 3: 431-440 \u219210\n- Tens digit 4: 441-450 \u219210\nWait, no, 440-449 would be tens digit 4, right? Wait, 440-449 is 10 pages, so tens digit 4 appears 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, tens digit 5: 451-460 \u219210\nTens digit 6: 461-470 \u219210\nTens digit 7: 471-480 \u219210\nTens digit 8: 481-488 \u21928 pages, but wait, 480-488 is 9 pages, so tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, no, 480-488 is 9 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times.\n\nWait, but in the range 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears as follows:\n\n- 0: 10 pages (401-410)\n- 1: 10 (411-420)\n- 2: 10 (421-430)\n- 3: 10 (431-440)\n- 4: 10 (441-450)\n- 5: 10 (451-460)\n- 6: 10 (461-470)\n- 7: 10 (471-480)\n- 8: 9 pages (481-488)\n\nWait, but 480 is part of the 480-488 range, so does 480 have a tens digit of 8? Yes, because 480 is 4 8 0, so tens digit is 8. So, from 480-488, that's 9 pages, so tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place for 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, total fours: 40 (from full hundreds) +10=50\n\nTotal eights: 40 (from full hundreds) +9=49\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, from 1-488, how many fours and eights?\n\nFrom 1-480, every 10 pages, one four and one eight. So, 48 fours and 48 eights. Then from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so one more eight (on 488). So, units place: 48 fours and 49 eights.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total fours: 48 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 187\n\nTotal eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 187 -98=89\n\nWait, so the answer would be 89 more fours than eights.\n\nBut let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, another way to calculate the number of times a digit appears in each place.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of fours: floor(488/10) =48, plus if the last digit is >=4, add 1. But since 488 ends with 8, which is >=4, but we're counting fours, so if the last digit is >=4, we add (8 -4 +1)=5? Wait, no, that's for the number of times a digit appears in the units place in a range. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, the number of fours in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10, which is 48, plus any extra fours in the incomplete group. The incomplete group is from 481-488, which has units digits 1-8. So, only 4 appears once (484), but wait, 484 is in the incomplete group. Wait, no, 484 is in 481-488, so units digit 4 appears once there. So, units digit fours: 48 +1=49? Wait, that contradicts my earlier count.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Earlier I thought units digit fours were 48, but if I consider that in the incomplete group, 481-488, units digit 4 appears once (at 484), then units digit fours would be 48+1=49, and units digit eights would be 48+1=49 as well, since 488 is included.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units digit eights were 49 because of 488, but I didn't consider that 484 would add another four. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nLet me clarify.\n\nTo count the number of fours in the units place from 1-488:\n\nEach 10 pages contribute one four. So, 488/10=48.8, so 48 fours. But in the incomplete group (481-488), the units digits go from 1-8, so 4 appears once (at 484). So total fours in units place:48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, eights in units place: Each 10 pages contribute one eight. So, 48 eights from 1-480. Then, in 481-488, units digit 8 appears once (at 488). So, total eights in units place:48+1=49.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought units digit fours were 48, but that's incorrect. It should be 49. Because in the incomplete group, 484 adds another four.\n\nSimilarly, units digit eights are 49.\n\nSo, that changes things.\n\nSo, units place: 49 fours, 49 eights.\n\nTens place: Let's recalculate.\n\nFrom 1-488, how many fours in the tens place?\n\nEach hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 4 full hundreds (1-400) contribute 4*10=40 fours.\n\nThen, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0-8. The tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 fours.\n\nSo, total fours in tens place:40+10=50.\n\nSimilarly, eights in tens place: Each hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488), so 9 eights.\n\nTotal eights in tens place:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: fours=89, eights=0.\n\nSo, total fours:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=49+50=99+89=188.\n\nTotal eights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so now I get a difference of 90. But earlier I thought it was 89, but that was because I didn't account for the extra four in the units place. So, I think this is correct now.\n\nWait, but let me check again.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFrom 1-488, how many fours?\n\nEvery 10 pages, one four. So, 488//10=48, and since 488%10 >=4, we add 1 more four. So, 48+1=49 fours.\n\nSimilarly, eights in units place: same calculation, 48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nFrom 1-488, how many fours?\n\nEach hundred has 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 fours.\n\nTotal:40+10=50 fours.\n\nEights in tens place:\n\nEach hundred has 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 eights.\n\nTotal:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFours:400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 fours.\n\nEights:0.\n\nSo, total fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal eights:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 89. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial calculation by not considering the extra four in the units place.\n\nTherefore, the correct difference is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each 10 pages contribute one 4 and one 8.\n   - From 1 to 480: 48 fours and 48 eights.\n   - From 481 to 488: Units digits are 1-8, adding one more 4 (at 484) and one more 8 (at 488).\n   - Total: 49 fours, 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights.\n   - From 1 to 400: 40 fours, 40 eights.\n   - From 401 to 488:\n     - Fours: 10 times in 440-449.\n     - Eights: 9 times in 480-488.\n   - Total: 50 fours, 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Fours: 89 times (400-488).\n   - Eights: 0 times.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- Fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- Eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 fours - 98 eights = 90 more fours.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " I think I should consider each digit place separately\u2014like units, tens, hundreds\u2014and count the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each place. Then, I can sum them up and find the difference.\n\nFirst, I'll start with the units place. For every 10 pages, the digits 0 through 9 repeat in the units place. So, from page 1 to page 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each set of 10, there's exactly one 4 and one 8. Since the book has 488 pages, I can divide 488 by 10 to get 48 full sets of 10 and then 8 extra pages (pages 481 to 488). Wait, but actually, page 488 is the last one, so maybe it's better to think of it as 488 pages, so 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, in each of these 48 sets, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. That would give me 48 fours and 48 eights from the units place. But wait, I also have the remaining 8 pages: 481 to 488. Let me check those. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in these 8 pages, there's one 4 (page 484) and one 8 (page 488). So, adding that, the units place contributes 48 + 1 = 49 fours and 48 + 1 = 49 eights. Wait, that seems like 49 each, so no difference from the units place. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here because 488 is included, so the last page is 488, which is part of the 48th set plus the extra 8 pages. Wait, no, actually, 488 is the 48th set plus 8 pages, but in the units place, the 488th page has a 8, so in the extra 8 pages, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 and 8 are both present once. So, units place: 48 sets \u00d71 four + 1 four = 49 fours, and 48 sets \u00d71 eight +1 eight = 49 eights. So, units place: 49 fours, 49 eights. So, no difference there.\n\nNext, let's move to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each hundred has 10 sets of 10, so in each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. Wait, no, actually, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. Wait, no, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each? Wait, no, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for example, from 0-99, the tens digit is 0 for 10 numbers (0-9), 1 for 10 (10-19), up to 9 for 10 (90-99). So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place per hundred. So, in the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times per hundred.\n\nSo, in 488 pages, how many hundreds do we have? Well, 488 is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). Wait, actually, 488 is 4 hundreds (1-400) and then 88 pages from 401-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the digit 8 appears 10 times as well. So, in four hundreds, that's 4 \u00d710 = 40 fours and 4 \u00d710 = 40 eights in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). Let me check: 401-410: tens digit is 0, 411-420: 1, ..., 481-488: 8. So, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except for 8, which appears only 8 times because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., 8 (481-488). So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears exactly 10 times except for 8, which appears 8 times because 481-488 is only 8 pages. Wait, no, 481-488 is 8 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? So, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in the 88 pages. So, in the tens place, for 401-488, how many 4's and 8's are there?\n\nFor the tens digit 4: that would be pages 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 fours in the tens place.\n\nFor the tens digit 8: that's pages 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's pages 480-488, which is 9 pages. Wait, 480-488 is 9 pages, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the last 88 pages.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 401-488 is 88 pages, so 488 - 400 = 88 pages. So, 401 is the first page, 401 to 488 is 88 pages. So, 480-488 is 9 pages, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the last 88 pages.\n\nWait, but let me check: 401-410: 10 pages, tens digit 0\n411-420: 10 pages, tens digit 1\n...\n471-480: 10 pages, tens digit 7\n481-490: 10 pages, but the book ends at 488, so only 8 pages (481-488), tens digit 8.\n\nSo, in the last 88 pages, the tens digit 8 appears only 8 times, not 9. Wait, no, because 481-488 is 8 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for each of these 8 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place in the last 88 pages.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that 480-489 would be 10 pages, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 9 pages from 480-488. Wait, no, 480 is included as page 480, and 488 is the last page. So, 480-488 is 9 pages, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place. Wait, but 480 is page 480, which is in the 480-489 range, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the last 88 pages.\n\nWait, but 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 pages, so yes, 9 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, in the last 88 pages, the digit 4 appears 10 times (pages 440-449), and the digit 8 appears 9 times (pages 480-488).\n\nSo, total in the tens place:\n\nFours: 4 hundreds \u00d710 fours = 40 fours, plus 10 fours in the last 88 pages, so 50 fours.\n\nEights: 4 hundreds \u00d710 eights = 40 eights, plus 9 eights in the last 88 pages, so 49 eights.\n\nSo, in the tens place, fours are 50, eights are 49. So, fours have 1 more than eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me make a table.\n\nTotal pages: 488.\n\nHundreds: 4 full hundreds (1-400), and then 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.), the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds \u00d710 = 40 fours, 40 eights.\n\nIn the last 88 pages (401-488):\n\n- Tens digit 0: 401-410 (10 pages)\n- Tens digit 1: 411-420 (10)\n- ...\n- Tens digit 7: 471-480 (10)\n- Tens digit 8: 481-488 (8 pages)\n\nWait, but 480 is included as page 480, which is part of the tens digit 8? No, 480 is part of the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 in the last 88 pages would be from 480-488, which is 9 pages, right? Because 480 is included, and 488 is the last page. So, 480-488 is 9 pages, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the last 88 pages.\n\nWait, but 480 is part of the 401-488 range, so the tens digit 8 starts at 480. So, from 480-488, that's 9 pages, so 9 times the tens digit 8.\n\nSimilarly, the tens digit 4 in the last 88 pages would be from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 fours in the tens place.\n\nSo, in the tens place:\n\nTotal fours: 40 (from hundreds) +10 (from 440-449) =50\n\nTotal eights:40 (from hundreds) +9 (from 480-488) =49\n\nSo, in the tens place, fours are 50, eights are 49, so fours have 1 more.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4, depending on the page number.\n\nFrom 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (since it's a 3-digit number, but page numbers are 1-488, so 1-99 are 2-digit numbers, so hundreds digit is 0. So, no 4's or 8's in the hundreds place here.\n\nFrom 100-199: hundreds digit is 1. So, no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 200-299: hundreds digit is 2. Again, no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 300-399: hundreds digit is 3. Still no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit is 4. So, for pages 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many pages is that? 488 - 400 +1 =89 pages. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so the hundreds digit is always 4 in 400-488, and 0 in 1-399. So, in the hundreds place, fours are 89, and eights are 0.\n\nSo, now, summing up:\n\nUnits place: fours=49, eights=49\n\nTens place: fours=50, eights=49\n\nHundreds place: fours=89, eights=0\n\nTotal fours: 49 +50 +89= 188\n\nTotal eights:49 +49 +0=98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check because I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so 89 fours. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the units place, I thought 488 pages, so 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each, and then the last 8 pages (481-488) contribute one 4 and one 8, so 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 hundreds \u00d710 fours =40, plus 10 fours from 440-449, total 50 fours. For eights, 4 hundreds \u00d710=40, plus 9 eights from 480-488, total 49.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\nSo, total fours:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal eights:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I counted correctly in the tens place for the last 88 pages. Let me check again.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8.\n\n- Tens digit 0: 401-410 (10 pages)\n- Tens digit 1:411-420 (10)\n- Tens digit 2:421-430 (10)\n- Tens digit 3:431-440 (10)\n- Tens digit 4:441-450 (10)\nWait, no, wait, 440-449 would be tens digit 4, so that's 10 pages:440-449.\n\nSimilarly, tens digit 5:451-460 (10)\nTens digit 6:461-470 (10)\nTens digit 7:471-480 (10)\nTens digit 8:481-488 (8 pages)\n\nWait, so in the tens place, from 401-488:\n\n- Tens digit 4: 440-449:10 pages\n- Tens digit 8:480-488:9 pages (since 480 is included and 488 is the end)\n\nWait, but 480 is part of the tens digit 8, so from 480-488, that's 9 pages, so 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nSo, in the tens place, eights are 40 (from hundreds) +9=49.\n\nSimilarly, fours are 40 +10=50.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in the last 88 pages, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times, but now I'm seeing it's 9 times because 480-488 is 9 pages. So, that's where the confusion was. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the last 88 pages.\n\nSo, total eights in the tens place:40 +9=49.\n\nSimilarly, fours in the tens place:40 +10=50.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 never appears.\n\nSo, total fours:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n\nTotal eights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 fours. That's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to check: total number of 4's should be the sum of 4's in units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nSimilarly for 8's.\n\nWait, let me think of another approach. Maybe using a formula or a more systematic way.\n\nIn any n-digit number, the number of times a digit d appears can be calculated by considering each digit place separately.\n\nBut in this case, the page numbers go up to 488, so they can be 1, 2, or 3 digits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nUnits place:\n\nAs before, in 488 pages, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 pages. So, number of complete cycles:488 \u00f710=48 cycles with a remainder of 8 pages.\n\nIn each cycle, digit 4 appears once, digit 8 appears once.\n\nSo, units place:4\u00d71=4 fours, 4\u00d71=4 eights, but wait, no, wait, each cycle contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 cycles would give 48 fours and 48 eights. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so digit 4 appears once (page 484) and digit 8 appears once (page 488). So, total units place:48+1=49 fours, 48+1=49 eights.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach cycle of 100 pages has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n\nSo, number of complete hundreds in 488 pages:4 (1-100, 101-200, etc.), with a remainder of 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each hundred, digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, digit 8 appears 10 times.\n\nSo, from 1-400:4\u00d710=40 fours, 4\u00d710=40 eights.\n\nIn the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles 0-8, with the last cycle being incomplete.\n\nIn the tens place, digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 fours.\n\nDigit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 eights.\n\nSo, total tens place:40+10=50 fours, 40+9=49 eights.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-399: hundreds digit is 0 or 1,2,3, so no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so 89 pages, so 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\nSo, total hundreds place:89 fours, 0 eights.\n\nNow, summing up:\n\nTotal fours:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n\nTotal eights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so that seems consistent.\n\nBut let me think if there's another way to approach this, maybe using a formula for digit counting.\n\nI remember that for a given digit position, the number of times a digit appears can be calculated based on higher digits, current digit, and lower digits.\n\nBut perhaps that's more complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that each digit from 0-9 appears equally in each position, except for the last partial cycle.\n\nBut in this case, since we're dealing with page numbers from 1 to 488, it's better to consider each digit place separately as I did before.\n\nSo, I think my earlier calculation is correct: 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't double-count or miss any pages.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, I counted 89 fours because pages 400-488 are 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, 40 fours from the first 400 pages, plus 10 fours from 440-449 in the last 88 pages, totaling 50 fours.\n\nSimilarly, 40 eights from the first 400 pages, plus 9 eights from 480-488, totaling 49 eights.\n\nIn the units place, 49 fours and 49 eights.\n\nSo, adding up, fours:49+50+89=188\n\nEights:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - 488 pages = 48 full cycles of 10 pages + 8 extra pages.\n   - Each cycle contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - Extra pages (481-488) contribute one 4 and one 8.\n   - Total: 49 fours, 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - 488 pages = 4 full hundreds + 88 extra pages.\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights.\n   - Extra pages (401-488): fours appear 10 times (440-449), eights appear 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 fours, 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - Pages 1-399: no 4's or 8's in hundreds place.\n   - Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times.\n   - Total: 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\nSumming up:\n- **Total fours**: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- **Total eights**: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90 more fours.\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by understanding how page numbers are structured and then count the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each digit place separately.\n\nFirst, I know that page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, I should consider each digit place\u2014units, tens, and hundreds\u2014since page numbers can be one, two, or three digits long. But wait, 488 is a three-digit number, so the hundreds place will come into play. Let me think about how to count the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 consecutive pages, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. That means the digit 4 appears once every 10 pages, and the same goes for 8. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 complete sets of 10, and then 8 extra pages (481 to 488). \n\nWait, but actually, page 1 is the first page, so the first set is pages 1-10, then 11-20, and so on. So, the number of complete sets of 10 is 48 because 48*10 = 480, and then pages 481-488 are the remaining 8 pages. So, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times, except for 0, which appears 48 times as well, but starting from page 10, right? Wait, no, page 1 is 1, so page 10 is the first page with a 0 in the units place. So, maybe 0 appears 48 times in the units place, but 4 and 8 would each appear 48 times as well because each set of 10 has exactly one 4 and one 8 in the units place. But wait, in the last 8 pages, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, total for units place: 4 appears 48 times (from each set of 10) plus 1 more (at 484), so 49 times. Similarly, 8 appears 48 times plus 1, so 49 times as well. Wait, but that can't be right because 488 is included, so the last page is 488, so 8 appears in the units place there. Hmm, but wait, let me check: from 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 each. Then from 481 to 488, that's 8 pages: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, in the units place, 4 appears at 484, and 8 appears at 488. So, units place: 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, in the units place, they're equal.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49), and similarly for 8 (80-89). \n\nSo, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 pages remaining (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 times for each digit. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the 88th page in the 400s). So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 and 8 appear?\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-490), but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 appears from 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, in the tens place, 4 appears once (in 440-449, but wait, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 pages, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 pages? Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 pages, but we're stopping at 488, so from 480-488, that's 9 pages. Wait, but 480 is included, so 480-488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). \n\nWait, but let me check: from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490), but since we stop at 488, the last group is 481-488, which is 8 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 pages, not 9. Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 pages, but since we start at 401, the first group is 401-410 (tens digit 0), then 411-420 (tens digit 1), etc., up to 481-490 (tens digit 8). But since the book ends at 488, the last group is 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). \n\nTherefore, in the tens place, from 401-488, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 8 times. So, total in the tens place: 4 appears 4*10 (from the complete hundreds) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50 times. 8 appears 4*10 + 8 = 48 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 48 times. So, 4 has 2 more in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Each complete hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 40 each. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times, and 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages, but wait, 480 is included, so 480-488 is 9 pages, so 8 times? Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 pages: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, the tens digit is 8 for all these, so 9 times? Wait, but 480 is the first page with tens digit 8 in that group. So, from 480-489, it's 10 pages, but we only have up to 488, so 9 pages. Therefore, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the last partial hundred. So, total in the tens place: 4 appears 40 + 10 = 50 times, and 8 appears 40 + 9 = 49 times. So, 4 has 1 more in the tens place.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier thought. So, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify: in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. Therefore, total in the tens place: 4 appears 40 + 10 = 50 times, and 8 appears 40 + 9 = 49 times. So, 4 has 1 more in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 8 appears 8 times, but that's incorrect. It's 9 times because 480-488 is 9 pages. So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the last partial hundred. So, total in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. So, 4 has 1 more in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only present in page numbers 100 and above. From 1-99, there's no hundreds digit. So, the hundreds digit cycles every 1000, but since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Specifically, pages 1-99: no hundreds digit. 100-199: hundreds digit 1. 200-299: hundreds digit 2. 300-399: hundreds digit 3. 400-488: hundreds digit 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. How about 8? Well, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, that's a big difference.\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences in each place.\n\nUnits place:\n- 4: 49 times\n- 8: 49 times\n\nTens place:\n- 4: 50 times\n- 8: 49 times\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4: 89 times\n- 8: 0 times\n\nSo, total for 4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nTotal for 8: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 49 = 98 times.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nUnits place:\n- Each set of 10 has one 4 and one 8.\n- 488 pages mean 48 full sets (480 pages) and 8 extra pages (481-488).\n- In units place, 4 appears once in the extra (484), and 8 appears once (488).\n- So, 48*1 +1 = 49 for 4, and same for 8.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place.\n- 4 full hundreds (1-400) give 4*10 = 40 each.\n- In the last 88 pages (401-488), 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n- So, 4: 40 + 10 = 50; 8: 40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n- 8 never appears.\n\nTotal:\n- 4: 49 +50 +89=188\n- 8:49 +49 +0=98\n- Difference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For example, in the tens place, when calculating the last partial hundred, I considered 480-488 as 9 pages, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place. But 480 is included, so that's correct. Also, in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 times for 4. That seems right.\n\nAnother way to check is to think about how many times each digit appears in each place.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the total number of 4's and 8's separately and then find the difference.\n\nTotal number of 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal number of 8's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal:49+49=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. We analyze each digit place (units, tens, and hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each set of 10 pages contains one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n- There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 480 pages, contributing 48 occurrences each.\n- Pages 481-488 add one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488).\n- **Total for 4:** 48 + 1 = 49\n- **Total for 8:** 48 + 1 = 49\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each hundred contains 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place.\n- 4 complete hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 each.\n- Pages 401-488 add 10 occurrences of 4 (440-449) and 9 occurrences of 8 (480-488).\n- **Total for 4:** 40 + 10 = 50\n- **Total for 8:** 40 + 9 = 49\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- Pages 400-488 have the hundreds digit as 4, contributing 89 occurrences.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n- **Total for 4:** 89\n- **Total for 8:** 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by understanding how page numbers are structured and then count the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each digit place separately.\n\nFirst, I think I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Since 488 is a three-digit number, I'll have to check each place for both digits 4 and 8. I remember that in problems like this, it's helpful to break down the count for each digit position.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For every block of 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once (like in page 4, 14, 24, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears once (like in page 8, 18, 28, etc.). So, in the units place, the count of 4's and 8's should be the same, right? But wait, I should check if the total number of pages affects this.\n\nSince the book has 488 pages, the units digit cycles 48 times (because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8). So, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times in the units place. But wait, 488 is not a multiple of 10, so actually, the units digit cycles 48 full times (0-9) and then one more partial cycle from 0 to 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 times (once in each full cycle), and 8 also appears 48 times. But in the partial cycle, the units digit goes up to 8, so 8 appears once more, making it 49 times, while 4 doesn't appear again. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again.\n\nActually, the units digit cycles every 10 pages. So, for 488 pages, there are 48 full cycles (10 pages each) and 8 extra pages. In each full cycle, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, 48 cycles \u00d7 1 = 48 times each. Now, the extra 8 pages are from 481 to 488. The units digits here are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So, in this partial cycle, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). Therefore, the total for units place is 48 + 1 = 49 for 4's and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8's. So, in the units place, both digits appear 49 times. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit changes every 10 pages. For example, pages 1-9 have 0 in the tens place, pages 10-19 have 1, and so on. So, each digit from 0 to 9 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive pages. Let me figure out how many times each digit appears in the tens place up to page 488.\n\nFirst, let's determine how many full hundreds we have. The book has 488 pages, so it's less than 500. So, we have 0-9 in the tens place for each hundred. Let me break it down:\n\n- Pages 1-99: The tens digit cycles from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\n- Pages 100-199: Similarly, the tens digit cycles again from 0 to 9, each appearing 10 times. So, another 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8.\n\n- Pages 200-299: Same as above, another 10 each.\n\n- Pages 300-399: Same, another 10 each.\n\n- Pages 400-488: Here, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for the tens digit, 0 appears 10 times (400-409), 1 appears 10 times (410-419), ..., up to 8 appearing 9 times (480-488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 pages, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here, not 10.\n\nWait, let me correct that. For pages 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. For each tens digit from 0 to 7, there are 10 pages each (e.g., 400-409, 410-419, etc.), but for 8, it's only from 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, in the tens place:\n\n- 0: 10 times (400-409)\n- 1: 10 times (410-419)\n- ...\n- 7: 10 times (470-479)\n- 8: 9 times (480-488)\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (from 440-449), and 8 appears 10 times in the 480-488 range, but wait, 480-488 is 9 pages, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place for pages 480-488.\n\nWait, no, the tens digit in 480-488 is 8, so each page from 480 to 488 has 8 in the tens place. So, how many pages is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here.\n\nSo, in the tens place, for the 400-488 range:\n\n- 4 appears 10 times (440-449)\n- 8 appears 9 times (480-488)\n\nNow, let's sum up all the tens places:\n\n- Pages 1-99: 10 times each for 4 and 8\n- Pages 100-199: 10 each\n- Pages 200-299: 10 each\n- Pages 300-399: 10 each\n- Pages 400-488: 10 for 4, 9 for 8\n\nSo, total for 4 in tens place: 10 (1-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-449) = 50 times.\n\nWait, no, actually, in each hundred block, the tens digit cycles through 0-9, so each digit appears 10 times per hundred. So, for 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 pages, and 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 pages.\n\nSo, total for 4 in tens place: 10 (1-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488 for 440-449) = 50 times.\n\nFor 8 in tens place: 10 (1-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (480-488) = 49 times.\n\nWait, that seems off because in each hundred block, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place, except the last block where it's 9 times.\n\nSo, total for 4 in tens place: 4 hundreds (1-399) each contribute 10, plus 10 in 400-488, so 4\u00d710 +10=50.\n\nFor 8 in tens place: 4 hundreds \u00d710=40, plus 9 in 400-488, so 40+9=49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times. So, the difference here is 1 more 4 than 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (488-400+1=89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times. So, the difference here is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- Each full cycle of 10 pages: 1 occurrence of 4 and 8 each.\n- 488 pages mean 48 full cycles (480 pages) and 8 extra pages.\n- In the units place, 4 appears once in each full cycle (48 times) plus once in the extra pages (484), so 49.\n- Similarly, 8 appears once in each full cycle (48 times) plus once in the extra pages (488), so 49.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For each hundred block (1-99, 100-199, etc.), each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n- So, 4 appears 10 times per hundred, and 8 appears 10 times per hundred.\n- There are 4 full hundred blocks (1-399) contributing 10 each for 4 and 8, so 4\u00d710=40 for both.\n- Then, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n- So, total for 4 in tens: 40 +10=50\n- Total for 8 in tens: 40 +9=49\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, total counts:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188\n\n8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nHmm, so the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the units place. For the units digit, in 488 pages, the units digit cycles 48 full times (0-9) and then 8 more pages (481-488). In each full cycle, 4 and 8 each appear once, so 48 each. Then, in the last 8 pages, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place:48+1=49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for each hundred, 10 times each for 4 and 8. So, 4 hundreds (1-399) give 40 each, plus in 400-488, 440-449 gives 10 for 4, and 480-488 gives 9 for 8. So, 50 for 4 and 49 for 8.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place for the first 480 pages.\n   - Pages 481-488 add one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488).\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times per hundred block (1-99, 100-199, etc.).\n   - For 400-488:\n     - 4 appears 10 times (440-449).\n     - 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 (from 1-399) + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 40 (from 1-399) + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 appears 0 times.\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by understanding how page numbers are structured and then count the occurrences of 4's and 8's separately before comparing them.\n\nFirst, I know that page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, each page is a number in that range, and each digit in those numbers can be either 4 or 8. I need to count how many times 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times 8 appears, then subtract the two to find the difference.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to consider each digit place separately: units place, tens place, hundreds place, and maybe even thousands place, though since the book only has 488 pages, the thousands place would only be relevant for page 400 and above, but 488 is less than 500, so the thousands digit would only be 4 for pages 400-488. Wait, no, actually, 400 is 4 in the hundreds place, not thousands. So maybe I don't have to consider the thousands place at all here because all page numbers are three digits or less.\n\nSo, let's think about the units place first. For the units digit, how often does 4 and 8 appear? Well, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, 4 appears once in the units place, and 8 appears once as well. So, for every 10 pages, we have one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n\nNow, how many such sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets of 10 pages and then 8 extra pages. In each full set, we have one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so that's 48 times each. Now, for the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, adding that, units place total for 4 is 48 + 1 = 49, and for 8 it's 48 + 1 = 49 as well. Wait, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1 to 480, that's 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 each. Then from 481 to 488, that's 8 numbers: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. The units digits here are 1 through 8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, yes, units place gives 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. So, so far, units place contributes 49 each.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each block of 100 numbers, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 times, and 8 for 80-89, also 10 times. So, in each 100-number block, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times as well.\n\nNow, how many full 100-number blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 400 is the start of the fourth block, but let's see: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500. Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so the last block is 401-488. So, we have four full blocks: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then the partial block 401-488.\n\nWait, no, actually, 1-100 is the first block, 101-200 the second, 201-300 the third, 301-400 the fourth, and then 401-488 is part of the fifth block, but it's not a full 100. So, in each of the first four blocks (1-400), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times each, and 8 appears 10 times each. So, that's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place up to page 400.\n\nNow, from 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles again. Let's see: 401-410: tens digit is 0, 411-420: 1, 421-430: 2, 431-440: 3, 441-450: 4, 451-460:5, 461-470:6, 471-480:7, 481-490:8, 491-500:9. But since we only go up to 488, the last few blocks are partial.\n\nSo, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410 (10 pages), 1 for 411-420 (10), 2 for 421-430 (10), 3 for 431-440 (10), 4 for 441-450 (10), 5 for 451-460 (10), 6 for 461-470 (10), 7 for 471-480 (10), 8 for 481-490 (but we only go up to 488, so that's 8 pages: 481-488). So, the tens digit is 8 for 8 pages in this range.\n\nSo, in the tens place, from 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (in 441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (in 481-488). So, adding that to the previous 40 each, the total for tens place is:\n\nFor 4: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50.\n\nFor 8: 40 (from 1-400) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me make sure. From 1-400, each hundred block contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 4\u00d710=40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 times, and 8 occurs in 481-488, which is 8 times because 488 is the last page. So, yes, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 8 = 48 for 8 in the tens place.\n\nSo, so far, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 48 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 1 for 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, right? Because they are two-digit numbers. So, 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, 200-299: 2, 300-399:3, 400-488:4.\n\nWait, so the hundreds digit is 0 for 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 800-899 would be pages 800 to 899, but since our book ends at 488, those pages don't exist. So, yes, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nStarting with 4:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nNow for 8:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 97. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place: 49 each, correct.\n\nTens place: 50 for 4, 48 for 8, correct.\n\nHundreds place: 89 for 4, 0 for 8, correct.\n\nAdding up 4's: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is indeed 188.\n\nAdding up 8's: 49 + 48 = 97, correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 91 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't miss any digit places or miscount somewhere.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position separately, then sum them up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position again to confirm.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nWell, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (at 484). So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times. Same for 8: 48 times in full cycles, plus once in the remaining 8 numbers (at 488), so 49 times. So, units place: 49 each.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4 in the tens place, how many times does it appear?\n\nEach hundred block has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). From 1-400, there are four hundred blocks, each contributing 10 times, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 times. So, total 40 + 10 = 50 times.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place, similarly, each hundred block has 10 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). From 1-400, four hundred blocks, each contributing 10 times, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 481-490, but we only go up to 488, so that's 8 numbers. So, 40 + 8 = 48 times.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor 4 in the hundreds place, it occurs from 400-488, which is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 89 times.\n\nFor 8 in the hundreds place, there are no pages from 800-899, so 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nAnd for the tens place in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 occurs in 481-490, but we only go up to 488, so that's 8 numbers. So, 8 times.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the total counts are 188 for 4's and 97 for 8's, so 91 more 4's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 91.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by understanding how page numbers are structured and where the digits 4 and 8 appear.\n\nFirst, I think I need to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers can be 1-digit, 2-digit, or 3-digit numbers. But when we print page numbers, each digit is printed individually, right? So, for example, page 10 has a '1' and a '0', so that's two digits. \n\nWait, but the problem is about how many more 4's are there than 8's. So, I guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and how many times 8 appears, then subtract the two counts to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place one by one.\n\n1. **Units place**: This is the rightmost digit. So, for every 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times a specific digit, like 4 or 8, appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then seeing how many times that digit appears in each cycle.\n\n2. **Tens place**: This is the middle digit. Every 100 pages, the tens digit cycles through 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 pages.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: This is the leftmost digit. For a 488-page book, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for pages 1-99), 1 (for 100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488). So, each hundred block contributes differently. The hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages, so the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not overcomplicating this. Maybe I should approach each digit place separately, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each place, and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\n- **Units digit 4's**: How many times does 4 appear in the units place from 1 to 488?\n  - Every 10 pages, 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, there are 488 / 10 = 48 full cycles of 10, each contributing one 4. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full cycles and a partial cycle from 481 to 488. In each full cycle, 4 appears once, so 48 times. Then, in the partial cycle, we check if 484 is within 481-488. Yes, 484 has a units digit of 4, so that's one more. So, total units digit 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- **Units digit 8's**: Similarly, every 10 pages, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 48 full cycles give 48 eights. Then, in the partial cycle, 488 is within 481-488, and 488 has a units digit of 8, so that's one more. So, total units digit 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nHmm, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. So, the difference here is zero. But wait, that can't be right because I know the hundreds place will affect the total count. Let me check my calculation again.\n\nWait, no, because in the units place, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 and 8 appear is indeed 49 each. So, no difference in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place:\n\n- **Tens digit 4's**: How many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n  - The tens digit is 4 for the numbers 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. But wait, our book goes up to 488, so the last block would be 440-449, right? Because 450-459 would be beyond 488, but wait, 440-449 is within 488. So, each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there?\n\n  - From 0-488, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, for hundreds 0,1,2,3, each contributes 10 times. Then, for the hundreds digit 4, we have 400-488. So, the tens digit 4 would be in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens digit 4's: 4 hundreds (0,1,2,3) each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, plus 10 from 440-449, total 50.\n\nWait, but wait, 4 hundreds: 0,1,2,3, and then 4. But in the hundreds digit 4, the tens digit 4 only goes up to 449, which is within 488. So, yes, 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\n- **Tens digit 8's**: Similarly, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n  - The tens digit is 8 for 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488. Each block contributes 10 numbers, except the last one, which contributes 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, let's calculate:\n\n  - For hundreds 0,1,2,3: each contributes 10 numbers where tens digit is 8, so 4*10=40.\n  - For hundreds 4: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n  - Total tens digit 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. So, the difference here is 50 - 49 = 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place:\n\n- **Hundreds digit 4's**: How many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place?\n  - The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. That's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\n- **Hundreds digit 8's**: How many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place?\n  - Well, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all because 800 would be beyond 488. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the differences from each digit place:\n\n- Units place: 49 - 49 = 0\n- Tens place: 50 - 49 = 1\n- Hundreds place: 89 - 0 = 89\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me double-check each digit place to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- For 4's: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48*1=48. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) include 484, which is a 4 in the units place. So, 48 +1=49. That seems correct.\n\n- For 8's: Similarly, 48 full cycles give 48 eights, and the remaining pages include 488, which is an 8 in the units place. So, 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For 4's: Each hundred block (0-99, 100-199, etc.) has a block where the tens digit is 4 (40-49, 140-149, etc.). For hundreds 0,1,2,3, each contributes 10 times. Then, for the hundreds 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\n- For 8's: Each hundred block contributes 10 times for the tens digit 8, except the last one. So, hundreds 0,1,2,3 contribute 10 each, so 4*10=40. Then, hundreds 4 contributes 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 +9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. Correct.\n- 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so 0 times. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up the differences:\n\n- Units: 0\n- Tens: +1\n- Hundreds: +89\nTotal: 0 +1 +89=90.\n\nWait, but the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the hundreds place. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, 89 times. And 8 never appears in the hundreds place because 800 is beyond 488. So, yes, 89 more 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, overall, the total number of 4's is 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nThe total number of 8's is 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98.\n\nSo, 188 -98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, that seems correct. I think I've double-checked each part, so I'm confident the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - **4's**: 488 / 10 = 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, plus one more in 484. Total: 49.\n   - **8's**: Similarly, 48 full cycles plus one in 488. Total: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - **4's**: Each hundred block (0-99, 100-199, etc.) has a block (40-49, etc.) contributing 10 times. 5 blocks (including 440-449) give 50.\n   - **8's**: Each hundred block contributes 10 times, except the last block (480-488) contributes 9. Total: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - **4's**: From 400-488, 89 times.\n   - **8's**: Never appears, so 0.\n\nSumming up:\n- **4's**: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- **8's**: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by understanding how page numbers are structured and then count the occurrences of each digit separately.\n\nFirst, I think I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. The tens digit can be 0 through 9, and the units digit can also be 0 through 9, except when constrained by the hundreds digit.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by counting how many times the digit 4 appears in each place (units, tens, hundreds) and then do the same for the digit 8. Then, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. Units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. So, the number of 4's in the units place would be 48 times 1, which is 48, plus 1 more if the last group includes a 4. Wait, the last group is 481-488, so 484 would be in there, so that's one more 4. So, units place gives us 49 4's.\n\n2. Tens place: Similarly, for the tens place, each group of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. How many such groups are there in 488 pages? Let's see, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds. Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (300-488), the tens digit is 4 in 340-349 and 440-449, right? Wait, no, 340-349 would be in the 300s, but 440-449 would be in the 400s. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10 4's. So, that's 40 + 10 = 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but hold on, 440-449 is part of the 400s, which we've already counted in the hundreds place. Hmm, no, actually, when we count the tens place, we're looking at each hundred separately. So, in each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9, so in each hundred, the 4 in the tens place occurs 10 times. So, for 1-100, 40-49 is 10 numbers. For 101-200, 140-149 is another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449 each contribute 10. So, from 1-400, that's 4 times 10, which is 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is another 10. So, total 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\n3. Hundreds place: Now, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the pages 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, right? Because 488 minus 400 is 88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the units place. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48 * 1 = 48. Then, in the last partial cycle, which is 481-488, the units digit 4 occurs once (at 484). So, 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens digit, so 4 hundreds (1-400) would give 4*10=40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is another 10, so 40 +10=50. That's correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, only the numbers 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds digit, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 4's there.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in each place.\n\n1. Units place: Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial group, 481-488, the units digit 8 occurs once (at 488). So, 48 +1=49 8's in the units place.\n\n2. Tens place: For the tens digit, each hundred contributes 10 8's in the tens place. So, from 1-100, 80-89 is 10 numbers. Similarly, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480-488). So, in each hundred, except the last one, we have 10 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, from 1-400, we have 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total 40 +9=49 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98.\n\nWait, so total 4's are 188, and total 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the counts for 8's in the tens place. From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, 40 +9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place for 8's. From 1-488, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the last group is 481-488, which includes 488, so that's one more 8, making it 49. That's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for 4's would be 89, but maybe I should confirm that.\n\nYes, from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 -400 +1=89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 4's there.\n\nSo, I think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full groups of 10 (480 numbers) contribute 48 fours. The last 8 numbers (481-488) include one more 4 (at 484), totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** Each hundred contributes 10 fours (e.g., 40-49). From 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, contributing 40 fours. The last partial hundred (401-488) includes 440-449, adding 10 fours, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 (89 numbers) each have a 4, contributing 89 fours.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full groups of 10 contribute 48 eights. The last group (481-488) includes one more 8 (at 488), totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** Each hundred contributes 10 eights (e.g., 80-89). From 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, contributing 40 eights. The last partial hundred (401-488) includes 480-488, adding 9 eights, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No pages have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by understanding how page numbers are structured and then count the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\nFirst, the book has pages from 1 to 488. So, each page number is a three-digit number if we consider leading zeros, but in reality, pages 1-9 are single-digit, 10-99 are two-digit, and 100-488 are three-digit. I think I should handle each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both 4 and 8.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each set of ten pages. So, for example, in 1-10, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. Similarly, in 11-20, each digit appears once, and so on. So, for the units place, the number of 4's and 8's should be the same, right?\n\nBut wait, the book ends at 488, so the last few pages might not complete a full set of ten. Let me check how many complete sets of ten there are and if there's a partial set at the end.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, the number of complete tens is 48 (since 48*10=480) and then 8 more pages (481-488). So, in the units place, for each complete ten, there's exactly one 4 and one 8. So, 48 sets of ten would give 48 4's and 48 8's. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place: 48+1=49 4's and 48+1=49 8's. So, in the units place, they are equal.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so the units digits go up to 8. So, in the last partial set, units digits are 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once. So, yes, units place contributes equally to 4 and 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. Wait, no, actually, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, etc., up to 9 for 90-99. So, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred.\n\nBut since our book goes up to 488, let's see how many hundreds we have. There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, for each complete hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8.\n\nSo, for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4*10=40 4's and 4*10=40 8's in the tens place. Now, let's look at the remaining pages from 401-488. The tens digits here go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does each appear?\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. Each tens digit appears 10 times except for the last one, which is 8 and appears 9 times because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, 401-410: tens digit 0, 10 pages. 411-420: tens digit 1, 10 pages. ... 471-480: tens digit 7, 10 pages. 481-488: tens digit 8, 8 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in the last partial hundred.\n\nSo, in the tens place, for the incomplete hundred (401-488), digit 4 appears once (when the tens digit is 4, which is 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is part of the 400-499 range, but we're only going up to 488. So, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 pages, so the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488 is 9 pages: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 pages because 488-480=8, but including both endpoints, it's 9 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the incomplete hundred.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in the incomplete hundred, the tens digit 4 would appear 10 times because 440-449 is 10 pages. So, in the tens place, in 401-488, the digit 4 appears 10 times (from 440-449) and the digit 8 appears 9 times (from 480-488). Therefore, in the tens place, total 4's are 4*10 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from incomplete hundred) = 50. And 8's are 4*10 (from complete hundreds) + 9 (from incomplete hundred) = 49.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because earlier I thought the incomplete hundred's tens digit 8 would appear 9 times. So, in the tens place, 4's total to 50 and 8's total to 49. So, in the tens place, 4's are one more than 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (400-488 inclusive). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400-488, and 3 for 300-399, etc. So, 8's in the hundreds place: zero.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's: 89, 8's: 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences.\n\nUnits place: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nTens place: 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\nHundreds place: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 48 complete tens (1-480) and then 8 more pages (481-488). So, each complete ten contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48*1=48, plus in the last 8 pages, 484 has a 4 and 488 has an 8, so 49 4's and 49 8's. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place: For each complete hundred, 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 40 each. Then, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 4's. The tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 8's. So, total tens place: 40+10=50 4's, and 40+9=49 8's.\n\nIn the hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 never appears there.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 pages.\n   - From page 1 to 480, there are 48 complete sets of 10 pages, contributing 48 4's and 48 8's.\n   - Pages 481-488 add one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488).\n   - Total 4's in units place: 49, 8's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - From page 1-400, 4 complete hundreds contribute 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - Pages 401-488:\n     - Tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449).\n     - Tens digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's in tens place: 50, 8's: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 1-399: Hundreds digit 4 doesn't appear.\n   - Pages 400-488: Hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n   - Total 4's in hundreds place: 89, 8's: 0.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - Total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Maybe I should start by understanding how page numbers are structured and where the digits 4 and 8 can appear.\n\nFirst, I know that page numbers range from 1 to 488. So, each page number is either a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Let me consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I think I can calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each place and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10, 4 and 8 each appear once. For example, in 1-10, 4 appears in 4 and 8 appears in 8. Similarly, this pattern repeats every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place would be the total number of complete decades (groups of 10) multiplied by 1, plus any extra in the incomplete decade if the total isn't a multiple of 10.\n\nWait, but the book has 488 pages, so let me calculate how many complete decades there are and if there's an incomplete one. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete decades and one incomplete decade of 8 numbers. In each complete decade, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, 48 decades would give 48 fours and 48 eights. Now, the incomplete decade is 481-488. Let me list the units digits here: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in this incomplete decade, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, adding these, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, they are equal.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (80-89). So, each hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place.\n\nNow, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think: the page numbers go up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, from 1-99, hundreds digit is 0, 100-199 is 1, 200-299 is 2, 300-399 is 3, and 400-488 is 4. So, each hundred from 1-100, 100-199, etc., except the last one, which is incomplete.\n\nSo, for the tens place, in each complete hundred, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times. There are 4 complete hundreds: 1-100, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 1-100 is the first hundred, 100-199 is the second, 200-299 is the third, and 300-399 is the fourth. Then 400-488 is the fifth, but it's incomplete. So, how many complete hundreds are there? Let me see: 1-100, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399. That's four complete hundreds. Each of these contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 fours and 40 eights in the tens place.\n\nNow, the incomplete hundred is 400-488. Let me check the tens digit here. The numbers 400-488 have tens digits from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? It would be from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, does 440-449 fall within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in this incomplete hundred. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here.\n\nSo, adding that to the previous 40, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's is 40 + 9 = 49. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's see when 4 appears in the hundreds place. That's from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. But wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit can only be up to 4, because 488 is less than 500. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, summing up the hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0.\n\nNow, let me total up all the occurrences.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- 488 pages, so 48 full decades (480 pages) and 8 extra pages (481-488).\n- Each decade contributes 1 four and 1 eight in the units place, so 48 each.\n- The last 8 pages: 481-488. The units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n- So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 fours, 48 + 1 = 49 eights. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each full hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place.\n- There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), so 4\u00d710=40 each.\n- The incomplete hundred (400-488):\n  - Fours in tens place: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 fours.\n  - Eights in tens place: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 eights.\n- So, total tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 fours, 40 + 9 = 49 eights. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (400 is the first, 488 is the last). So, 89 fours.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So, 0 eights. Correct.\n\nAdding up:\n- 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n- 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place. From 400-488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nIs there any other place where 8 could appear in the hundreds digit? No, because 800 would be beyond 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights there.\n\nI think that's all. So, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so 188 - 98 = 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any edge cases. For example, when counting the units and tens places, did I consider all numbers correctly? Let me think about the units place again. For each set of 10, 4 and 8 each appear once. 488 pages mean 48 full sets of 10, and then 8 extra. So, 48\u00d72 + 2 (for 4 and 8 in the last 8). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, the units digit cycles every 10, so in each of the 48 full decades, 4 and 8 each appear once, so 48 each. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once. So, 48 +1 =49 each. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, each full hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights. 4 full hundreds, so 40 each. Then, in the last partial hundred (400-488), fours in tens place: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. Eights in tens place: 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, total tens: 50 fours, 49 eights. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's: 49+50+89=188, 8's:49+49+0=98. Difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each set of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - 488 pages = 48 full decades + 8 extra pages.\n   - Full decades: 48 fours and 48 eights.\n   - Extra pages (481-488): one 4 and one 8.\n   - Total: 49 fours, 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each full hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights.\n   - 4 full hundreds (1-100, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399): 40 fours, 40 eights.\n   - Partial hundred (400-488):\n     - Fours: 10 (440-449).\n     - Eights: 9 (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 fours, 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Fours: 89 times (400-488).\n   - Eights: 0 times (as 800+ exceeds 488).\n   - Total: 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by understanding how page numbers are structured and then count the occurrences of each digit.\n\nFirst, I know that page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, each page is labeled with a number, and each of these numbers can have one, two, or three digits. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me think about how to count the digits systematically. Maybe I can break it down by the number of digits in the page numbers: one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nStarting with one-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digit 4 appears once (page 4) and the digit 8 appears once (page 8). So, the count for both is 1 each. That means, in the one-digit numbers, the number of 4's and 8's is the same. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nNext, moving on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each number has a tens place and a units place. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in both places.\n\nLet me start with the tens place. For the tens digit, 4 can appear in the tens place for numbers from 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, 8 can appear in the tens place for numbers from 80 to 89, which is also 10 numbers, so 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers. The digit 4 can appear in the units place for numbers 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 times, right? Wait, no, from 10 to 99, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. There are 9 tens (10-99), so that's 9 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the units place for 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's also 9 times.\n\nWait, but when I count the units digit, I should include all two-digit numbers. So, for two-digit numbers, the units digit for 4 appears 9 times, and same for 8. So, in two-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times, and the digit 8 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times. So, again, the counts are equal, so the difference remains zero.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because there are three places: hundreds, tens, and units. I need to count the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each place separately.\n\nLet's start with the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book has 488 pages. So, for hundreds digit 4, the numbers are from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can't be 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0 through 9 for each hundred. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place from 100 to 488.\n\nLet me break this down by hundreds. From 100 to 399, and then 400 to 488.\n\nFor 100-399: Each hundred has 10 tens digits (0-9). For each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.). Since there are 3 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the digit 4 appears 3 times 10 = 30 times in the tens place. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 30 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for 400-488: The tens digit can be 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It would be for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does 449 exist? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place here. Similarly, 8 in the tens place would be for 480-488. But wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place for 400-488.\n\nSo, total for the tens place: 4 appears 30 (from 100-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 40 times. 8 appears 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39 times.\n\nWait, let me verify that. From 100-399, each hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place, so 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30 for both 4 and 8. From 400-488, for 4 in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. For 8 in the tens place, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, yes, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times in the tens place for 400-488. So, total for tens place: 40 for 4 and 39 for 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, let's break it down by hundreds.\n\nFrom 100-399: Each hundred has 10 units digits (0-9) for each ten. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears once in the units place for each ten. So, 10 times per hundred. Since there are 3 hundreds, that's 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 times for 4. Similarly, 8 appears 30 times.\n\nFrom 400-488: The units digit can be 0-9, but we have to consider up to 488. So, for each ten, the units digit cycles 0-9. Let's see how many complete tens we have.\n\nFrom 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last number). So, for each ten (e.g., 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488), the units digit cycles 0-9 except for the last ten, which is 480-488, which only goes up to 8.\n\nSo, for 400-479, each ten has 10 numbers, so the digit 4 appears once in the units place for each ten. There are 8 tens (400-409, ..., 470-479), so 8 \u00d7 1 = 8 times for 4. Similarly, 8 appears once per ten, so 8 \u00d7 1 = 8 times for 8.\n\nNow, for 480-488: The units digits are 0-8. So, the digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). So, that's 1 time each.\n\nSo, total for units place in 400-488: 4 appears 8 + 1 = 9 times, and 8 appears 8 + 1 = 9 times.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. For 400-479, each ten has 10 numbers, so for the units digit, each digit 0-9 appears once per ten. So, for 400-479, there are 8 tens (400-409 up to 470-479), so each digit appears 8 times in the units place. So, 4 appears 8 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nThen, for 480-488, the units digits go from 0-8, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. The digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). So, total for 400-488: 4 appears 8 + 1 = 9 times, and 8 appears 8 + 1 = 9 times.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the units digits are 0-8, which is 9 digits. So, each digit from 0-8 appears once, except for 9, which doesn't appear because 488 is the last page. So, yes, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, the total for units place in 400-488 is 9 for both 4 and 8.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4 appears 8 times in 400-479 and 1 time in 480-488, so 9 times total. Similarly for 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears 9 times and 8 appears 9 times in 400-488.\n\nTherefore, total units place counts for three-digit numbers:\n\n4: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39 times.\n\n8: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39 times.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because from 100-399, each hundred contributes 10 times per digit, so 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 for both 4 and 8. Then from 400-488, we have 9 times for each digit in the units place, so total 30 + 9 = 39 for both.\n\nBut wait, when I added up earlier, I thought the tens place for 4 was 40 and for 8 it was 39. Now, units place is 39 for both. So, let me sum up all three places for three-digit numbers.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nTens place: 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\nUnits place: 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\nSo, total for three-digit numbers:\n\n4: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 times.\n\n8: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78 times.\n\nWait, that seems like a big difference. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nTens place: From 100-399, 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 (for each digit in tens place) = 30 for 4 and 30 for 8. From 400-488, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total for tens place: 30 + 10 = 40 for 4, and 30 + 9 = 39 for 8. Correct.\n\nUnits place: From 100-399, 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30 for 4 and 30 for 8. From 400-488, 4 appears 9 times and 8 appears 9 times. So, total units place: 30 + 9 = 39 for 4, and 30 + 9 = 39 for 8. Correct.\n\nSo, total for three-digit numbers:\n\n4: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n\n8: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n\nNow, let's add up all the digits from one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nOne-digit:\n\n4: 1\n\n8: 1\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n4: 19\n\n8: 19\n\nThree-digit:\n\n4: 168\n\n8: 78\n\nTotal for 4: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nTotal for 8: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188 and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place for three-digit numbers, I counted 89 times for 4. But from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears 40 times and 8 appears 39 times.\n\nIn the units place, both appear 39 times.\n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 for 4.\n\n0 + 39 + 39 = 78 for 8.\n\nAdding one-digit and two-digit:\n\n4: 1 + 19 = 20\n\n8: 1 + 19 = 20\n\nSo, total 4's: 20 + 168 = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 20 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the counts for three-digit numbers, especially the units place.\n\nFrom 400-488, for units digit:\n\nEach ten from 400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479 has 10 numbers, so in each ten, the units digit cycles 0-9. So, in each ten, 4 appears once in the units place, and 8 appears once.\n\nThere are 8 tens (400-409 to 470-479), so 8 \u00d7 1 = 8 times for 4 and 8 \u00d7 1 = 8 times for 8.\n\nThen, the last ten is 480-488, which has units digits 0-8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units digit for 400-488: 8 + 1 = 9 for 4, and 8 + 1 = 9 for 8.\n\nSo, yes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place for 400-488, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo, yes, the counts seem accurate.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's is 188 and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by understanding how page numbers are structured and where the digits 4 and 8 can appear.\n\nFirst, I know that page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, each page number is either a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. For example, pages 1-9 are single-digit, 10-99 are two-digit, and 100-488 are three-digit numbers. I think I should consider each of these ranges separately because the number of digits where 4 and 8 can appear will vary.\n\nLet me start by calculating how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers. Then I'll do the same for the digit 8 and compare the totals.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place (the first digit from the right):**\n   - For single-digit pages (1-9), the digit 4 appears once at page 4.\n   - For two-digit pages (10-99), the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in each set of 10 (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. There are 9 such sets (10-99), so that's 9 times. But wait, from 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers, which is 9 sets of 10. So, 9 times 4 in the units place. But wait, I think I might have made a mistake here because from 10 to 99, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, for each ten, 4 appears once in the units place. Since there are 9 tens (10-99), that's 9 times. But wait, page 4 is single-digit, so in the units place for two-digit numbers, it's 9 times. So, total for units place in 4 is 1 (from single-digit) + 9 (from two-digit) = 10 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 1 to 99, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's 10 times: 4,14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. So, yes, 10 times. So, that's correct.\n\n2. **Tens place (the second digit from the right):**\n   - For single-digit pages, the tens place doesn't exist, so 4 doesn't appear here.\n   - For two-digit pages (10-99), the tens digit is 4 in the range 40-49. That's 10 pages where the tens digit is 4. So, 10 times.\n   - For three-digit pages (100-488), the tens digit can be 4 in multiple cases. Let's see, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book only goes up to 488, when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can be 0-8, but let's see.\n\nWait, maybe I should break it down:\n\n- Hundreds digit is 1: The tens digit can be 0-9, so when tens digit is 4, we have pages 140-149, which is 10 pages.\n- Hundreds digit is 2: Similarly, 240-249, another 10 pages.\n- Hundreds digit is 3: 340-349, another 10 pages.\n- Hundreds digit is 4: Now, the tens digit is 4, but the page numbers go up to 488. So, the tens digit being 4 in the hundreds place of 4 would be 440-449. But wait, does 449 exist? Since the book has 488 pages, yes, 449 is within the range. So, that's another 10 pages.\n\nSo, in the tens place for three-digit numbers, 4 appears 4 times 10 = 40 times.\n\nWait, but wait, from 100-488, the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. So, for each hundreds digit, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times. So, 4 hundreds digits, each contributing 10, so 40 times. But wait, when hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit 4 is allowed, so yes, 40 times.\n\nSo, total for tens place: 10 (from two-digit) + 40 (from three-digit) = 50 times.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because for two-digit numbers, the tens place is only from 10-99, so 40-49 is 10 times. Then for three-digit numbers, hundreds digits 1,2,3,4, each with tens digit 4, so 10 each, so 4*10=40. So, total tens place 4's: 10+40=50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place (the third digit from the right):**\n   - For single-digit and two-digit pages, the hundreds place doesn't exist, so 4 doesn't appear here.\n   - For three-digit pages (100-488), the hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages, so that's 89 times. But wait, 400 to 488 is 89 pages, but each of these pages has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times.\n\nWait, but 400 to 488 is 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 in each of those. So, 89 times.\n\nSo, total hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 10\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\n\nTotal 4's: 10 + 50 + 89 = 149.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times. So, 89 is correct.\n\nTens place: two-digit numbers (40-49: 10) and three-digit numbers (140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449: each 10, so 4*10=40). So, 10+40=50. Correct.\n\nUnits place: from 4,14,24,...,94: that's 10 times. Correct.\n\nSo, 10+50+89=149. So, 4 appears 149 times.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 8:\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Single-digit pages: 8 appears once at page 8.\n   - Two-digit pages: 8 appears in the units place for each set of 10, like 18,28,...,98. That's 9 sets, so 9 times.\n   - So, total units place 8's: 1 + 9 = 10.\n\nWait, but wait, from 1-99, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 8,18,28,...,98: that's 10 times. So, correct.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Two-digit pages: 80-89, which is 10 pages where the tens digit is 8.\n   - Three-digit pages: hundreds digits can be 1,2,3,4. For each, the tens digit can be 8, so 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is only 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So, for hundreds digits 1,2,3: each contributes 10 pages where tens digit is 8. For hundreds digit 4, it's only 9 pages because 489 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's:\n\n- Two-digit: 10\n- Three-digit:\n  - Hundreds 1: 10\n  - Hundreds 2: 10\n  - Hundreds 3: 10\n  - Hundreds 4: 9\n  So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nWait, but wait: 180-189 is 10 pages, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 (two-digit) + 39 (three-digit) = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought two-digit tens place was 10, and three-digit was 39, so total 49. Hmm.\n\nWait, but let me recount:\n\n- Two-digit tens place: 80-89: 10 pages.\n- Three-digit tens place:\n  - 180-189: 10\n  - 280-289: 10\n  - 380-389: 10\n  - 480-488: 9\n  So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 + 39 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - For three-digit pages, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n\n- Units place: 10\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\n\nTotal 8's: 10 + 49 = 59.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier I thought units place was 10, tens place 49, so total 59. But let me check again.\n\nWait, in the tens place, for three-digit numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+9=39. Plus the two-digit 80-89:10, so 39+10=49. So, yes, 49 in tens place. Units place:10. So, total 59.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4 appears 149 times, and 8 appears 59 times. So, the difference would be 149 - 59 = 90. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, 89 times. Correct.\n\nTens place: 10 (from 40-49) + 40 (from 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449) = 50. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 10. So, 10+50+89=149.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nTens place: 10 (from 80-89) + 39 (from 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488) = 49.\n\nUnits place:10.\n\nTotal 8's: 59.\n\nSo, 149 - 59 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 pages, correct.\n\nFor 8's, in the hundreds place, none because the book ends at 488, so 800-899 isn't included. So, 0.\n\nWait, but in the tens place for 8's, 480-488 is 9 pages, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place for 8's. From 1-99, 8 appears 10 times in the units place (8,18,...,98). Then from 100-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? For each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9, so in each hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the units place. But since the book ends at 488, the last hundred is 400-488, which is only 89 pages. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place in 400-488?\n\nWait, in 400-488, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, in 400-409: 408 is one, 410-419:418, etc., up to 480-488:488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place in 400-488?\n\nWell, from 400-488, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten, so for each ten, 8 appears once. There are 8 full tens in 400-480 (since 480 is the 8th ten after 400), and then 481-488 is 8 more pages, but the units digit 8 only appears once at 488.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nFrom 400-409: 408\n410-419:418\n420-429:428\n430-439:438\n440-449:448\n450-459:458\n460-469:468\n470-479:478\n480-488:488\n\nSo, that's 9 times in the units place for 400-488. So, from 100-399, each hundred contributes 10 units place 8's, so 3 hundreds: 3*10=30. Then from 400-488, 9 times. So, total units place 8's: 10 (from 1-99) + 30 (from 100-399) +9 (from 400-488) = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place 8's were 10. So, I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me correct this.\n\nWait, earlier I thought units place 8's were 10, but actually, from 1-99, it's 10, and from 100-488, it's 30 (from 100-399) +9 (from 400-488) =39. So, total units place 8's:10+39=49.\n\nWait, so that changes things. So, units place 8's:49.\n\nEarlier, I thought units place 8's were 10, but that's only from 1-99. From 100-488, it's 39 more, so total 49.\n\nWait, that's different from my initial calculation. So, let me recalculate the total 8's.\n\nSo, units place:49\n\nTens place:49\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier I thought units place was 10, but now it's 49. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, I think I confused the units place count earlier. Let me re-examine.\n\nWhen I first calculated units place 8's, I thought it was 10, but that's only from 1-99. From 100-488, each hundred has 10 units place 8's, except the last hundred, which has 9.\n\nSo, from 100-399: 3 hundreds, each contributing 10 units place 8's: 3*10=30.\n\nFrom 400-488: 9 units place 8's.\n\nSo, total units place 8's:10 (from 1-99) +30 (from 100-399) +9 (from 400-488)=49.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, we have:\n\nFrom 1-99: 80-89:10.\n\nFrom 100-488: 180-189,280-289,380-389: each 10, so 3*10=30.\n\nAnd 480-488:9.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's:10+30+9=49.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49)=98.\n\nWait, that's different from my initial calculation. So, where did I go wrong earlier?\n\nEarlier, I thought units place 8's were 10, but that's only from 1-99. From 100-488, it's 39 more, making it 49. Similarly, tens place 8's were 49. So, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 8's were 59, but that was a mistake because I didn't account for all the units place 8's beyond 1-99.\n\nSo, let me correct this.\n\nSo, total 8's:98.\n\nWait, but let me check again.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 1-99:10\n- 100-399:30\n- 400-488:9\nTotal:10+30+9=49.\n\nTens place:\n\n- 1-99:10\n- 100-399:30\n- 400-488:9\nTotal:10+30+9=49.\n\nSo, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 4's:149, 8's:98.\n\nDifference:149-98=51.\n\nWait, that's different from my initial thought of 90. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, I think I messed up the units place count for 8's. Let me go through it again.\n\nFor units place 8's:\n\n- Pages 1-99: 8,18,28,...,98:10 times.\n\n- Pages 100-399: Each hundred has 10 units place 8's, so 3 hundreds:3*10=30.\n\n- Pages 400-488: The units digit 8 appears at 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488: that's 9 times.\n\nSo, total units place 8's:10+30+9=49.\n\nSimilarly, tens place 8's:\n\n- Pages 1-99:80-89:10.\n\n- Pages 100-399:180-189,280-289,380-389: each 10, so 3*10=30.\n\n- Pages 400-488:480-488:9.\n\nTotal tens place 8's:10+30+9=49.\n\nSo, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 4's:149, 8's:98.\n\nDifference:149-98=51.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 149, 8's were 59, but that was wrong because I didn't account for all the units place 8's beyond 1-99.\n\nSo, the correct total 8's are 98, so the difference is 149-98=51.\n\nWait, but I'm still not sure. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcounting the units place 8's. Let me list them out.\n\nFrom 1-99:8,18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98:10.\n\nFrom 100-199:108,118,128,138,148,158,168,178,188,198:10.\n\nFrom 200-299:208,218,...,298:10.\n\nFrom 300-399:308,...,398:10.\n\nFrom 400-488:408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488:9.\n\nSo, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nSimilarly, tens place:\n\nFrom 1-99:80-89:10.\n\nFrom 100-199:180-189:10.\n\nFrom 200-299:280-289:10.\n\nFrom 300-399:380-389:10.\n\nFrom 400-488:480-488:9.\n\nSo, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nSo, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, 4's:149, 8's:98.\n\nDifference:149-98=51.\n\nWait, but I thought earlier that 4's were 149, 8's were 59, but that was wrong because I didn't account for the units place 8's beyond 1-99.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be 51 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the difference would be 90, but now it's 51. Let me check the 4's count again.\n\n4's:\n\nUnits place:10.\n\nTens place:50.\n\nHundreds place:89.\n\nTotal:149.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\n8's:\n\nUnits place:49.\n\nTens place:49.\n\nTotal:98.\n\nSo, difference:149-98=51.\n\nWait, that seems correct now.\n\nSo, the answer is 51 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears in 4,14,24,...,94 (10 times) and in each subsequent hundred up to 488.

    "text": " Maybe I should start by understanding how page numbers are structured and then count the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each digit place separately.\n\nFirst, I know that page numbers go from 1 to 488. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. So, maybe I should consider each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both 4 and 8.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, 4 and 8 will appear every 10 numbers. For example, in 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4) and 8 appears once (page 8). This pattern continues every 10 numbers. So, how many times does each digit appear in the units place?\n\nSince the book has 488 pages, the units digit cycles every 10 pages. So, the number of complete cycles in 488 pages is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a cycle, we take the integer part, which is 48 complete cycles. In each cycle, 4 and 8 each appear once, so that's 48 times each in the units place.\n\nBut wait, 488 is not exactly a multiple of 10. The last partial cycle is from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers. So, in the units place for the last partial cycle, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, adding those, the total for units place is 48 + 1 = 49 times for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 times for 8. Hmm, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. So, no difference there.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for pages 40-49, which is 10 times, and 8 for pages 80-89, also 10 times. So, in each 100-page block, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, how many complete 100-page blocks are there in 488 pages? That would be 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial block from 401-488. So, for each complete block, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 times each.\n\nNow, let's check the partial block from 401-488. The tens digit here ranges from 0 (401-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, we need to see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nIn the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 0 for 401-409 (but wait, 401-410 would have tens digit 0, but actually, 401-410 is 10 numbers, but since 488 is less than 500, let me correct this. Wait, 401-488 is from 401 to 488, which is 88 pages. So, the tens digits go from 0 (401-409) to 8 (480-488). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here?\n\nLooking at 401-488, the tens digit is 4 when the page is between 440-449. So, that's 10 pages (440-449). So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in this partial block. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place when the page is between 480-488. That's 9 pages (480-488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 pages because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in this partial block.\n\nSo, adding this to the earlier 40 times each, the total for the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 times for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 times for 8.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check. From 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. The tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. So, yes, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the partial block.\n\nSo, total for tens place: 4 appears 40 + 10 = 50 times, 8 appears 40 + 9 = 49 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears once more than 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit cycles every 1000, so in 488 pages, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, and 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all because the next block would be 800-899, which is beyond 488. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, that's a big difference.\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences of 4 and 8 across all digit places.\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, that can't be right because 188 - 98 = 90, which seems like a lot. Maybe I made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me go back. When I calculated the units place, I got 49 for both 4 and 8. Then, tens place: 50 for 4 and 49 for 8. Hundreds place: 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check each step again.\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of complete cycles: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete cycles, each contributing 1 occurrence of 4 and 8 in the units place. So, 48 \u00d7 1 = 48 for each. Then, the last partial cycle is from 481-488, which is 8 numbers. The units digits here are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units: 48 + 1 = 49 for each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach 100-page block contributes 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place. There are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 each. Then, the partial block 401-488: 401-488 is 88 pages. The tens digit cycles every 10 pages, so for 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). Now, for the tens digit being 4, that's 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, 10 times. For tens digit 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 9 times in the partial block. So, total tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, 40 + 9 = 49 for 8. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, 89 times. 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the next block would be 800-899, which is beyond 488. So, 0 times for 8. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I thought maybe the difference would be smaller, but 90 seems correct. Let me see if I can think of another way to verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's separately and see if the totals make sense.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because I thought maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let me check the units and tens places again.\n\nUnits place: 49 each. Correct.\n\nTens place: 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times. So, 4 is once more in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, the total difference is 1 (from tens) + 89 (from hundreds) = 90.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that I double-counted some pages where both 4 and 8 appear, like in the number 484, which has both 4 and 8? But no, because we're counting the occurrences of each digit separately. So, 484 contributes one 4 and one 8, but in our counts, each digit is counted individually. So, that's correct.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the number of times the digits 4 and 8 appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (4 and 8) appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total complete cycles in 488 pages: 48 cycles (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8).\n   - Each cycle contributes 1 occurrence of 4 and 8 in the units place: 48 \u00d7 1 = 48 each.\n   - Partial cycle (481-488): 4 appears once (484), 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8.\n\n2. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Complete 100-page blocks: 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400).\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 for both 4 and 8.\n   - Partial block (401-488):\n     - 4 appears in 440-449: 10 times.\n     - 8 appears in 480-488: 9 times.\n   - Total in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4; 40 + 9 = 49 for 8.\n\n3. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488: 89 times.\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place within 488 pages: 0 times.\n\n4. **Summing Up Occurrences:**\n   - **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Difference = 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " I think the best way is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the two counts to find the difference.\n\nFirst, I should consider how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number since the book has 488 pages. So, page numbers go from 1 to 488. I need to count the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4. I'll consider each place separately.\n\n1. **Units place**: The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. To find how many times, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete tens and then 8 more numbers. In the units place, the next 4 would be at 484, which is within 488, so that's 48 times. Hmm, but wait, actually, each ten contributes one 4 in the units place, so from 1 to 488, how many tens are there? Let me think differently: the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488, which is 48, plus one more if the last partial group has a 4. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, the last group is 480-488, which includes 484, so that's another 4. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, no, because from 1 to 480, there are 48 groups of 10, each contributing a 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, adding one more 4. So total units 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place**: The digit 4 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically for 10 numbers at a time. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. Let's see how many such groups there are. From 1 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such ranges are there? Well, 440-449 is within 488, so that's the fifth range. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's. So 5 * 10 = 50. Wait, but does 440-449 fit into 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, each contributing one 4. So that's 89 4's.\n\nNow, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So total 4's: 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct. Units place: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Hmm, okay.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place**: Similar to 4, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 ends with an 8, so does that count? Yes, because the last page is 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8, and then the last group from 480-488 includes 488, so that's another 8. So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place**: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers at a time: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? So, in the tens place, the ranges are 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers). So that's 4 full ranges and one partial. Each full range contributes 10 8's, and the partial contributes 9. So total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So total 8's: 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8. From 80-89: 10 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10. Then 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So yes, 4*10 +9=49. So that's correct.\n\nNow, total 4's: 188, total 8's:98. The difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me check the counts again, maybe I overcounted somewhere.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 49. Let's see: from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in units? Every 10 numbers, so 48 full groups (1-480) contribute 48, then 484 is the 49th. So yes, 49.\n\n- Tens: 50. Because 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50.\n\n- Hundreds: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nTotal:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:49. Same logic as 4's, since 488 ends with 8.\n\n- Tens:49. As calculated earlier.\n\n- Hundreds:0.\n\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Because 400-488 is 89 numbers, but each of those has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 4's. From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 ranges, each 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, the tens place: 80-89:10,180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. So 4 full ranges and one partial, totaling 49. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I should consider that in the hundreds place for 8's, there's no contribution because the book only has 488 pages. So, yes, correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this using a formula for digit counting.\n\nFor a given digit d and position (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times d appears can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor each position, the count is:\n\nhigher = number formed by digits higher than the current position\ncurrent = current digit\nlower = number formed by digits lower than the current position\n\nThen, depending on the current digit, the count is:\n\nif current > d: (higher + 1) * 10^position\nif current == d: higher * 10^position + lower + 1\nif current < d: higher * 10^position\n\nBut maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, since the number is 488, which is a three-digit number, I can break it down into hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use this method to cross-verify.\n\nLet me try for digit 4 in units place.\n\nNumber is 488.\n\nFor units place, d=4.\n\nWe can consider each digit position separately.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- The number is 488.\n\n- For units digit, we can think of it as the number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488.\n\nAs before, every 10 numbers, so 488 // 10 = 48, and since 488 % 10 >=4, we add 1, so 48 +1=49.\n\nSame as before.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor tens digit, d=4.\n\nWe can think of the number as higher digits and lower digits.\n\nThe tens digit cycles every 100 numbers.\n\nSo, higher = 48 (since 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so higher is 4).\n\ncurrent = 8 (tens digit of 488 is 8).\n\nlower = 8 (units digit of 488 is 8).\n\nSo, since current digit (8) > d (4), the count is (higher +1)*10^1 = (4+1)*10=50.\n\nWhich matches our earlier count of 50.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor hundreds digit, d=4.\n\nNumber is 488.\n\nhigher = 0 (since we're at the hundreds place, higher digits don't exist beyond that).\n\ncurrent =4.\n\nlower =88.\n\nSince current == d, the count is higher * 10^2 + lower +1 = 0*100 +88 +1=89.\n\nWhich matches our earlier count.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8:\n\nUnits place:\n\nd=8.\n\nNumber is 488.\n\nunits digit:8.\n\nhigher=48, current=8.\n\nSince current >=d, count is (higher +1)*1=48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nd=8.\n\nNumber is 488.\n\ntens digit=8.\n\nhigher=4.\n\ncurrent=8.\n\nlower=8.\n\nSince current ==d, count is higher*10 + lower +1=4*10 +8 +1=40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nd=8.\n\nNumber is 488.\n\nhundreds digit=4.\n\nSince 4 <8, count is higher*100=0*100=0.\n\nSo, total 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nThus, difference:188-98=90.\n\nOkay, so that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the difference was 90, but I want to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.\n\nWait, let me just recount the 4's and 8's.\n\n4's:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:50\n\nHundreds:89\n\nTotal:188\n\n8's:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:49\n\nHundreds:0\n\nTotal:98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 full groups of 10 in 488, plus one more in 484, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each range (40-49, 140-149, etc.), totaling 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 4 full ranges \u00d7 10 + 9 (from 480-488) = 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should figure out how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488, and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nI remember that when counting digits, it's helpful to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. So I'll start by analyzing each place for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nLet's start with the digit 4. I'll check how many times 4 appears in the units place, then in the tens place, and finally in the hundreds place.\n\n1. **Units place for 4:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484.\n   - Since the book has 488 pages, I can calculate how many full sets of 10 there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, that would give 48 fours, but I think I need to check if the 49th set has any numbers. The 49th set would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the units digit 4 appears once more at 484. So total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, no, actually, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (sets of 10) plus any extra in the incomplete set. The total number of pages is 488, so the number of complete decades is 48 (since 48*10=480), and the remaining 8 pages (481-488) include one more 4 at 484. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place for 4:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449.\n   - How many such sets are there in 488 pages? Each set is 100 pages, so 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, meaning there are 4 full sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. But wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, 410-419, etc., but actually, in the 400s, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449. Wait, no, each hundred has one set of 10 where the tens digit is 4. So from 1-400, there are 4 sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), each contributing 10 fours. Then from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, and 440-449. Wait, that's 5 sets, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. But wait, 400-488 is only 89 pages, so the tens digit 4 appears in 400-409 (10 numbers), 410-419 (10), 420-429 (10), 430-439 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, 5 sets. So total tens place 4's: 4 sets before 400 (each 10) = 4*10=40, and 5 sets from 400-488, each 10, so 5*10=50. Wait, but wait, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So total tens place 4's: 40 (from 1-399) + 50 (from 400-488) = 90. Wait, but wait, 400-488 is only 89 pages, so the 440-449 set is within that. So yes, 5 sets, each 10, so 50. So total tens place 4's: 4*10=40 + 5*10=50, total 90.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 1-100: 40-49 is one set, 10 fours. From 101-200: 140-149, another 10. From 201-300: 240-249, another 10. From 301-400: 340-349, another 10. So that's 4 sets, 4*10=40. Then from 400-488: 400-409 (10), 410-419 (10), 420-429 (10), 430-439 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each 10, so 50. So total tens place 4's: 40 + 50 = 90.\n\n3. **Hundreds place for 4:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). So the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, contributing 89 fours.\n\nWait, but wait, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89, yes. So hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\nNow, total number of 4's: units (49) + tens (90) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 90 = 139, 139 + 89 = 228.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, units place: from 1-488, every 10 numbers has one 4 in the units place. So 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, and then the 49th set (481-490) has one more 4 at 484. So units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: as above, 90.\n\nHundreds place: 89.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 + 90 + 89 = 228. Hmm, okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place for 8:**\n   - Similar to 4, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n   - 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, and then in the 49th set (481-490), 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place. So units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place for 8:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489.\n   - How many such sets are there in 488 pages?\n   - From 1-400, there are 4 sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 eights in the tens place. That's 4*10=40.\n   - From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, 480-489 is 10 numbers, but only up to 488. So from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers? No, 480 is the first, then 481, ..., up to 488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, no, 488 - 480 + 1 = 9, yes. So that's 9 eights in the tens place from 480-488.\n\nWait, but wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So the tens place 8's from 400-488: 9.\n\nSo total tens place 8's: 4*10=40 + 9=49.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. From 1-400, 4 sets, each 10, so 40. Then from 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place for 8:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So 4's: 228, 8's: 98. Therefore, the difference is 228 - 98 = 130.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to miscount.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 90\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 90 = 139; 139 + 89 = 228.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 228 - 98 = 130.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So the number of 4's printed is 130 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check the tens place for 4 again. I had 90 fours in the tens place. Let me recount that.\n\nFrom 1-400, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349. That's four sets, each 10 numbers, so 4*10=40.\n\nFrom 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449. That's five sets, each 10 numbers, so 5*10=50.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 440-449 is within that. So yes, 5 sets, 50 fours.\n\nSo total tens place 4's: 40 + 50 = 90. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, from 1-400, four sets, each 10, so 40. From 400-488, 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nUnits place for both 4 and 8: 49 each, correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4's: 89, 8's: 0, correct.\n\nSo total 4's: 228, 8's: 98. Difference: 130.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there any overlap or double-counting? For example, in the number 444, the digit 4 appears three times, so it's counted in units, tens, and hundreds. But when I count each place separately, that's correct because each occurrence is counted once per digit place.\n\nSimilarly, for 488, the digit 8 appears twice, so it's counted once in units and once in tens. So my method is correct.\n\nWait, but in the units place for 8, I counted 49. Let me check: from 1-488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So the count is floor(488/10) + (if 488 mod 10 >=8, add 1). 488/10=48.8, so floor is 48. Since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=8, so add 1. So total units place 8's: 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly for 4's in units place: 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place for 4: 90, correct.\n\nTens place for 8: 49, correct.\n\nHundreds place for 4: 89, correct.\n\nSo yes, the total counts seem accurate.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 228, and the number of 8's is 98. So the difference is 228 - 98 = 130.\n\nSo, the answer should be 130 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 228, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 228 - 98 = 130.\n\n\\boxed{130}"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by understanding how page numbers are structured and then count the occurrences of 4 and 8 separately.\n\nFirst, I know that page numbers go from 1 to 488. Each page number is printed once, so I need to consider each digit in these numbers. The digits can be in the units place, tens place, or hundreds place. So, I think I should count how many times 4 appears in each place and do the same for 8, then subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every set of ten consecutive numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., each digit from 0-9 appears once in the units place. So, for the units digit, the number of 4's and 8's would depend on how many complete sets of ten there are in 488 pages.\n\nWait, but 488 isn't a multiple of ten. So, I need to calculate how many complete tens there are and then check the remaining numbers. Let me think: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of ten and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). \n\nIn each complete set of ten, there's exactly one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 sets, that would be 48 times each. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the units digit 4 appears once (484) and the units digit 8 appears once (488). \n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 48 (from complete sets) + 1 (from remaining) = 49.\nTotal 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that's the same. Hmm, so maybe I need to check the tens place as well.\n\nIn the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears ten times in a set of 100 numbers. So, for example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 ten times (40-49) and 8 ten times (80-89). So, in each hundred, there are 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, as I thought, there are 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 4's and 40 8's.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, let's see: from 401-409, the tens digit is 0; 410-419, it's 1; 420-429, it's 2; 430-439, 3; 440-449, 4; 450-459, 5; 460-469, 6; 470-479, 7; 480-488, 8.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, right? Because 488 is the last page. So, the tens digit for 480-488 is 8, but there are only 9 numbers here (480, 481, ..., 488). So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place here? It's 9 times, right?\n\nWait, no, because the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, so that's 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, each with tens digit 8. So, that's 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, in the 440-449 range, the tens digit is 4, and there are 10 numbers here (440-449). So, that's 10 4's in the tens place.\n\nSo, in the remaining 88 pages, how many 4's and 8's are there in the tens place?\n\n- 4's: Only in 440-449, which is 10 times.\n- 8's: In 480-488, which is 9 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from remaining) = 50.\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, so 50 4's and 49 8's in the tens place. That's a difference of 1 so far.\n\nNow, I should check the hundreds place as well. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case because the book has 488 pages.\n\nWait, no. Let me think: The page numbers go from 1 to 488, so the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive). So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? It's 89 times, because each of those pages has 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, how many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. The hundreds digits go up to 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, the count for 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\nTotal 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nNow, let me sum up all the 4's and 8's across units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nFirst, total 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- 48 complete sets of ten: 48 4's and 48 8's.\n- Remaining 8 pages (481-488): 484 has a 4, and 488 has an 8.\nSo, units 4's: 48 +1 = 49; units 8's: 48 +1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n- 4 complete hundreds: 4*10=40 4's and 40 8's.\n- Remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n  - 440-449: 10 4's in tens place.\n  - 480-488: 9 8's in tens place.\nSo, tens 4's: 40 +10=50; tens 8's: 40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 400-488: 89 pages, so 89 4's.\n- 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up:\n4's: 49 +50 +89 = 188\n8's: 49 +49 +0 = 98\nDifference: 188 -98 =90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total complete sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48.\n   - 48 sets \u00d7 1 occurrence each = 48 4's and 48 8's.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488): 1 occurrence of 4 (484) and 1 occurrence of 8 (488).\n   - Total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Complete hundreds: 4 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400).\n   - 4 \u00d7 10 occurrences = 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - Remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n     - 440-449: 10 4's.\n     - 480-488: 9 8's.\n   - Total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488: 89 pages with 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - No page has 8 in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n   - Total 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- Total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by understanding how page numbers work and then count the occurrences of each digit separately.\n\nFirst, I know that page numbers start at 1 and go up to 488. So, I need to consider all the numbers from 1 to 488 and count how many times the digit 4 appears and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I can subtract the count of 8's from the count of 4's to find the difference.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to analyze each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Because each digit can appear in different places, I should consider each position one by one.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For the units digit, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. Then it repeats. So, in every block of 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. But wait, in our case, we start at 1, so maybe the first block is 1-10, which includes 0 in the units place for page 10. Hmm, but the first page is 1, so maybe from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 times (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles and then 8 extra numbers). Wait, no, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so that's 48 full cycles of 10 and then 8 more numbers.\n\nWait, but maybe I should think of it as 488 pages, so 488 numbers. So, the units digit cycles every 10. So, for each position, the number of times a digit appears can be calculated based on how many complete cycles there are and the remainder.\n\nLet me formalize this a bit. For any digit position (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times a specific digit appears can be determined by:\n\n1. Dividing the total number of pages by the place value (10 for units, 100 for tens, 1000 for hundreds, but since we're dealing with 488, hundreds place is up to 4).\n\n2. The quotient gives the number of complete cycles, and the remainder tells us how many extra numbers we have beyond the complete cycles.\n\n3. Then, for each digit, the count is calculated based on the quotient and the remainder.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if this is exactly correct. Maybe I should look for a formula or method to count digit occurrences.\n\nI remember that for counting digits in a range, you can use a method where you break down each digit position and calculate how many times each digit appears. Let me try to apply that here.\n\nFirst, let's handle the units place.\n\nUnits place:\n\nThe total number of pages is 488. So, for the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in the units place, except possibly for the last partial cycle.\n\nThe number of complete cycles is 488 divided by 10, which is 48 complete cycles, with a remainder of 8 (since 48*10=480, and 488-480=8).\n\nIn each complete cycle, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for each complete cycle, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 appears once.\n\nSo, in 48 complete cycles, the digit 4 appears 48 times, and the digit 8 appears 48 times.\n\nNow, for the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in these, the digit 4 appears once (at 484), and the digit 8 appears once (at 488).\n\nSo, total in units place: 48 +1 =49 times for 4, and 48 +1=49 times for 8.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so yes, 488 is part of the remaining 8 numbers. So, units place: both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each.\n\nHmm, so so far, units place: 49 each.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nTens place:\n\nSimilarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each block of 100. So, for each complete block of 100, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, total pages are 488, so the number of complete hundreds is 4 (since 4*100=400), with a remainder of 88 pages (400 to 488).\n\nWait, no, actually, when considering the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in each hundred block. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each.\n\nSo, the number of complete hundreds in 488 is 4 (since 4*100=400), and then 88 pages remaining.\n\nSo, in each complete hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 complete hundreds, each digit appears 4*10=40 times.\n\nNow, for the remaining 88 pages (from 401 to 488), we need to calculate how many times each digit appears in the tens place.\n\nWait, but from 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 as well. Let's see:\n\nFrom 401 to 409: tens digit is 0.\n\nFrom 410 to 419: tens digit is 1.\n\nFrom 420 to 429: tens digit is 2.\n\nFrom 430 to 439: tens digit is 3.\n\nFrom 440 to 449: tens digit is 4.\n\nFrom 450 to 459: tens digit is 5.\n\nFrom 460 to 469: tens digit is 6.\n\nFrom 470 to 479: tens digit is 7.\n\nFrom 480 to 488: tens digit is 8.\n\nWait, but 488 is the end, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit is 8 for all of these, but only 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for each of these. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in this partial block.\n\nSimilarly, for other digits in the tens place in the remaining 88 pages:\n\nFrom 401 to 409: tens digit is 0, so 9 times.\n\nFrom 410 to 419: tens digit is 1, 10 times.\n\nFrom 420 to 429: tens digit is 2, 10 times.\n\nFrom 430 to 439: tens digit is 3, 10 times.\n\nFrom 440 to 449: tens digit is 4, 10 times.\n\nFrom 450 to 459: tens digit is 5, 10 times.\n\nFrom 460 to 469: tens digit is 6, 10 times.\n\nFrom 470 to 479: tens digit is 7, 10 times.\n\nFrom 480 to 488: tens digit is 8, 9 times.\n\nSo, for each digit in the tens place in the remaining 88 pages:\n\n- 0: 9 times\n\n- 1:10\n\n- 2:10\n\n- 3:10\n\n- 4:10\n\n- 5:10\n\n- 6:10\n\n- 7:10\n\n- 8:9\n\n- 9:0 (since we don't reach 490-499)\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, for the remaining 88 pages:\n\n- 4 appears 10 times\n\n- 8 appears 9 times\n\nSo, total in tens place:\n\n- For digit 4: 4*10 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from remaining 88 pages) = 40 +10=50\n\n- For digit 8: 4*10 (from complete hundreds) +9=40 +9=49\n\nWait, but wait, in the complete hundreds, each digit appears 4*10=40 times in the tens place. Then, in the remaining 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total in tens place:\n\n- 4: 40 +10=50\n\n- 8:40 +9=49\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nIn the hundreds place, each digit from 1 to 4 appears in the hundreds place, since the book has 488 pages.\n\nFrom page 1 to 99: hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's here.\n\nFrom page 100 to 199: hundreds digit is 1. So, no 4's or 8's in hundreds place here.\n\nFrom page 200 to 299: hundreds digit is 2. Again, no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom page 300 to 399: hundreds digit is 3. Still no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom page 400 to 488: hundreds digit is 4. So, in this range, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive, which is 89 pages: 488 - 400 +1=89).\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWhat about digit 8 in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, hundreds place:\n\n- 4:89\n\n- 8:0\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences.\n\nFor digit 4:\n\n- Units place:49\n\n- Tens place:50\n\n- Hundreds place:89\n\nTotal 4's:49 +50 +89= 188\n\nFor digit 8:\n\n- Units place:49\n\n- Tens place:49\n\n- Hundreds place:0\n\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nEach complete cycle of 10 has one 4 and one 8 in the units place. 488/10=48.8, so 48 complete cycles, each contributing 1 to 4 and 1 to 8. So, 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 numbers: 481-488. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units total:48+1=49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach complete hundred contributes 10 times each digit in the tens place. So, 4 complete hundreds (1-400) contribute 4*10=40 times each for 4 and 8. Then, the remaining 88 pages (401-488). Let me recount how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nFrom 401-409: tens digit 0, 9 times.\n\n410-419: tens digit 1, 10 times.\n\n420-429: tens digit 2, 10 times.\n\n430-439: tens digit 3, 10 times.\n\n440-449: tens digit 4, 10 times.\n\n450-459: tens digit 5, 10 times.\n\n460-469: tens digit 6, 10 times.\n\n470-479: tens digit 7, 10 times.\n\n480-488: tens digit 8, 9 times.\n\nSo, for 4 in the tens place: 10 times (440-449).\n\nFor 8 in the tens place:9 times (480-488).\n\nSo, total in tens place:\n\n4:40 (from complete hundreds) +10=50\n\n8:40 (from complete hundreds) +9=49\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly pages 400-488 have hundreds digit 4, which is 89 pages. So, 4 appears 89 times in hundreds place.\n\n8 never appears in hundreds place because the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, 8:0 in hundreds place.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused about the tens place for 480-488. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers:480,481,...,488. So, the tens digit is 8 for all of these, right? So, that's 9 times 8 in the tens place. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 440-449, that's 10 numbers, so tens digit 4 appears 10 times.\n\nSo, yes, the tens place counts seem correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about another approach. Maybe I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position separately.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the problem as a three-digit number, padding with leading zeros for numbers less than 100, so that each page number is represented as a three-digit number, e.g., page 1 is 001, page 10 is 010, page 100 is 100, etc. This might make it easier to count each digit place separately.\n\nBut, wait, that might complicate things because leading zeros aren't actually printed. So, maybe it's better to stick with the original approach without padding.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should consider that for numbers less than 100, the hundreds digit is 0, so it doesn't contribute to the count of 4's or 8's. Similarly, for numbers less than 10, the tens digit is 0. So, maybe the initial approach is correct.\n\nLet me try another way: for each digit place, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\nAs before, 488 numbers. Each digit 0-9 appears floor(488/10)=48 times, with a remainder of 8. So, digits 0-9 each appear 48 times in units place, plus an additional 1 for digits 1-8 in the remaining 8 numbers (since 481-488 have units digits 1-8). Wait, but 488 mod 10 is 8, so the units digits from 1 to 8 each get an extra count. So, digits 1-8 each appear 48 +1=49 times, and 9 and 0 appear 48 times.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so units digits 1-8 each have 49 counts, 9 and 0 have 48.\n\nSo, in units place, 4 appears 49 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears floor(488/100)=4 times, each contributing 10 counts in the tens place, so 4*10=40 times each. Then, the remainder is 88, so for the tens place, we have to count how many times each digit appears in the tens place from 1 to 88.\n\nWait, but 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, 8 units. So, for the tens place, the number of complete cycles is 4, each contributing 10 counts, so 4*10=40. Then, the remaining 88 numbers (from 401 to 488) would have their tens digits as follows:\n\nFrom 401 to 409: tens digit 0 (9 numbers)\n\n410-419: tens digit 1 (10 numbers)\n\n420-429: tens digit 2 (10 numbers)\n\n430-439: tens digit 3 (10 numbers)\n\n440-449: tens digit 4 (10 numbers)\n\n450-459: tens digit 5 (10 numbers)\n\n460-469: tens digit 6 (10 numbers)\n\n470-479: tens digit 7 (10 numbers)\n\n480-488: tens digit 8 (9 numbers)\n\nSo, in the tens place, digit 4 appears 10 times, digit 8 appears 9 times, and others as per their counts.\n\nTherefore, total in tens place:\n\n4:40 +10=50\n\n8:40 +9=49\n\nHundreds place:\n\nAs before, only 400-488 have hundreds digit 4, which is 89 times. 8 never appears in hundreds place.\n\nSo, 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so that seems consistent. So, I think my initial calculation was correct.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can check a smaller example to see if the method works.\n\nLet's say we have a 20-page book. How many 4's and 8's would there be?\n\nPage numbers:1-20.\n\nUnits place:\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears twice in units place (since 20/10=2). So, 4 appears twice, 8 appears twice.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears once in tens place for 10-19, and 0 for 1-9. So, 4 appears 0 times, 8 appears 0 times in tens place.\n\nHundreds place: none, since 20 < 100.\n\nSo, total 4's:2, 8's:2. Difference:0.\n\nWait, but let's count manually:\n\nPages:1-20.\n\n4's:4,14: two times.\n\n8's:8,18: two times.\n\nSo, difference is 0. That matches.\n\nAnother example: 40-page book.\n\nUnits place:\n\n40/10=4 complete cycles. So, 4's:4, 8's:4.\n\nRemaining 0, so no extra.\n\nTens place:\n\n40/100=0 complete cycles, but from 1-40, the tens digits are:\n\n1-9: tens digit 0\n\n10-19: tens digit 1\n\n20-29: tens digit 2\n\n30-39: tens digit 3\n\n40: tens digit 4\n\nSo, in tens place, 4 appears once (at 40). 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's:4 (units) +1 (tens)=5\n\n8's:4 (units) +0=4\n\nDifference:5-4=1.\n\nWait, let's count manually:\n\nPages 1-40.\n\n4's:4,14,24,34,40: five times.\n\n8's:8,18,28,38: four times.\n\nDifference:1. So, correct.\n\nSo, the method works for smaller numbers. So, I think my approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. By analyzing each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately, we determine that the digit 4 appears 188 times and the digit 8 appears 98 times. The difference is calculated as follows:\n\n- **Units place:** Both 4 and 8 appear 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nTotal counts:\n- 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n- 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " I think I should start by understanding how page numbers are structured and then count the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in each place.\n\nFirst, I know that page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, each page number is a three-digit number, but the first few pages will have one or two digits. However, since we're dealing with digits, maybe it's easier to consider all page numbers as three-digit numbers by adding leading zeros. So, page 1 would be 001, page 10 would be 010, and so on. But wait, does that affect the count of 4's and 8's? I think it does because the leading zeros would add more digits, but since the actual page numbers don't have leading zeros, those digits aren't printed. So maybe I shouldn't include leading zeros. Instead, I should consider each page number as it is, whether it's one, two, or three digits.\n\nLet me think. For page numbers from 1 to 9, they are single-digit. From 10 to 99, they are two-digit. From 100 to 488, they are three-digit. So, I can break the problem into three parts: single-digit pages, two-digit pages, and three-digit pages. I'll count the number of 4's and 8's in each part separately and then add them up.\n\nStarting with single-digit pages (1-9). Here, the possible digits are 1 through 9. So, how many 4's are there? Just one, which is page 4. Similarly, how many 8's? Just one, which is page 8. So, in single-digit pages, the count of 4's is 1 and 8's is 1. So, the difference here is 0.\n\nMoving on to two-digit pages (10-99). Now, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nLet's start with the units place. For two-digit numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, for each ten's place (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), the units digit goes through 0-9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (e.g., 14, 24, etc.), and the digit 8 appears once (e.g., 18, 28, etc.). Since there are 9 sets of ten in two-digit numbers (10-99), that's 9 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place. So, units place contributes 9 4's and 9 8's.\n\nNow, the tens place. For two-digit numbers, the tens digit is 1 in 10-19, 2 in 20-29, and so on up to 9 in 90-99. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, that would be 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, for 8 in the tens place, that's 80-89, another 10 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have 10 4's and 10 8's.\n\nSo, adding up the two places for two-digit numbers: units place gives 9 each, tens place gives 10 each. So total for two-digit pages, 4's are 9 + 10 = 19, and 8's are 9 + 10 = 19. So, again, the difference is 0.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit pages, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complicated because now we have hundreds, tens, and units places. Let me break this down further.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many three-digit page numbers there are. From 100 to 488, that's 488 - 100 + 1 = 389 pages. But maybe it's better to handle each digit place separately.\n\nLet me consider the hundreds place, tens place, and units place separately for three-digit numbers.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Because 488 is the last page, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4.\n\nSo, for the hundreds place:\n- When the hundreds digit is 1 (100-199), how many times does 4 appear? Zero, because 1 is not 4.\n- Similarly, how many times does 8 appear? Zero, because 1 is not 8.\n- When the hundreds digit is 2 (200-299), same logic, 4 and 8 don't appear in the hundreds place.\n- When the hundreds digit is 3 (300-399), same thing, no 4's or 8's.\n- When the hundreds digit is 4 (400-488), here, the hundreds digit is 4, so every page from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n- For 8's in the hundreds place, since the highest hundreds digit is 4, there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times, and 8's appear 0 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place in three-digit numbers (100-488). The tens digit can be 0-9, but depending on the hundreds digit, the range changes.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to consider each position separately. Let's think about the tens place across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488.\n\nIn the tens place, the digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, for each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit goes through 0-9 ten times each, except for the last group (400-488), which only goes up to 8 in the tens place because 488 is the last page.\n\nWait, no, actually, 400-488 is 89 pages. Let me see: 400-488 is 89 pages because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, in the tens place, for 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, 488 is the last page, so the tens digit can go up to 8, but actually, 480-488 is the last part. So, the tens digit in 400-488 goes from 0 to 8, but for each tens digit, how many times does it appear?\n\nWait, perhaps I should handle each hundreds group separately.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. Hundreds group 100-199:\n   - The tens digit cycles 0-9 for each ten pages. So, for each tens digit (0-9), there are 10 numbers. So, in the tens place, each digit 0-9 appears exactly 10 times.\n   - So, for 4's in the tens place: 10 times.\n   - For 8's in the tens place: 10 times.\n\n2. Hundreds group 200-299:\n   - Same as above, each tens digit 0-9 appears 10 times.\n   - So, 4's: 10 times.\n   - 8's: 10 times.\n\n3. Hundreds group 300-399:\n   - Same, each tens digit 0-9 appears 10 times.\n   - 4's: 10 times.\n   - 8's: 10 times.\n\n4. Hundreds group 400-488:\n   - Here, the hundreds digit is 4, and the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 because 488 is the last page. So, the tens digits are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Each of these digits appears how many times?\n\n   Let's see: from 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. For each tens digit (0-8), how many numbers are there? For tens digits 0-7, each has 10 numbers (e.g., 400-409, 410-419, etc.), but for tens digit 8, it only goes up to 488, so that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we stop at 488, it's 9 numbers.\n\n   So, for tens digits 0-7: each appears 10 times.\n   For tens digit 8: appears 9 times.\n\n   Therefore, in the tens place for 400-488:\n   - 4's: Let's see, 4 is one of the tens digits from 0-8. So, when the tens digit is 4, how many numbers? From 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's 10 numbers. So, 4's in tens place: 10 times.\n   - 8's: When the tens digit is 8, which is 9 times (480-488). So, 8's in tens place: 9 times.\n\nWait, but I'm considering the tens place across all three-digit numbers. So, let me sum up:\n\nFor the tens place in three-digit numbers:\n- Hundreds groups 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: each contributes 10 4's and 10 8's. So, 3 groups \u00d7 10 each = 30 4's and 30 8's.\n- Hundreds group 400-488: contributes 10 4's (from 440-449) and 9 8's (from 480-488).\n- So, total in tens place: 30 + 10 = 40 4's, and 30 + 9 = 39 8's.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, in the tens place across all three-digit numbers, 4's appear 40 times, and 8's appear 39 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers (100-488). The units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten numbers. So, similar to the tens place, but let's see.\n\nAgain, let's break it down by hundreds groups:\n\n1. Hundreds group 100-199:\n   - For each ten numbers (e.g., 100-109, 110-119, etc.), the units digit cycles 0-9. So, in each ten, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place.\n   - There are 10 tens in 100-199, so 10 times each for 4 and 8.\n\n2. Hundreds group 200-299:\n   - Same as above, 10 times each for 4 and 8.\n\n3. Hundreds group 300-399:\n   - Same, 10 times each.\n\n4. Hundreds group 400-488:\n   - Now, here, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten, but the last ten might be cut short because we stop at 488.\n   - From 400-488, how many tens are there? Let's see:\n     - 400-409: units 0-9 (10 numbers)\n     - 410-419: same\n     - ...\n     - 480-488: units 0-8 (9 numbers)\n   - So, for units digits:\n     - For tens 40-48 (i.e., 400-480), each ten has 10 numbers, so units digits 0-9 appear once each per ten.\n     - But the last ten is 480-488, which has only 9 numbers, so units digits 0-8 appear once each, and 9 doesn't appear.\n   - So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place in 400-488?\n     - For each ten (400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479), 4 appears once in the units place (e.g., 404, 414, ..., 474). There are 8 full tens (400-409 up to 470-479), so 8 times, plus in 480-488, 484 is present, so that's 1 more. So total 9 times.\n   - Similarly, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n     - For each ten (400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479), 8 appears once (e.g., 408, 418, ..., 478). That's 8 times.\n     - In 480-488, 488 is the last page, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So that's 1 more, making it 9 times.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check that again. For the units place in 400-488:\n\n- For each ten from 400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479, there are 8 full tens, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So that's 8 each.\n\n- Then, in 480-488, which is the 9th ten, the units digits go up to 8. So, in this ten, 484 is present (units digit 4) and 488 is present (units digit 8). So, that's one more 4 and one more 8.\n\nTherefore, in the units place for 400-488:\n- 4's: 8 (from full tens) + 1 (from 484) = 9\n- 8's: 8 (from full tens) + 1 (from 488) = 9\n\nWait, but actually, in the last partial ten (480-488), the units digits go from 0 to 8. So, 484 is 484, which is within 480-488, so yes, that's one 4. Similarly, 488 is the last page, so that's one 8.\n\nSo, in the units place for 400-488:\n- 4's: 8 + 1 = 9\n- 8's: 8 + 1 = 9\n\nTherefore, combining all hundreds groups for the units place:\n\n- Hundreds groups 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: each contributes 10 4's and 10 8's. So, 3 groups \u00d7 10 each = 30 4's and 30 8's.\n- Hundreds group 400-488: contributes 9 4's and 9 8's.\n- So, total in units place: 30 + 9 = 39 4's and 30 + 9 = 39 8's.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nSo, summarizing the three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 4's, 0 8's\n- Tens place: 40 4's, 39 8's\n- Units place: 39 4's, 39 8's\n\nSo, total in three-digit numbers:\n- 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n- 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nNow, let's add up all the digits from single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit pages.\n\nFrom single-digit pages:\n- 4's: 1\n- 8's: 1\n\nFrom two-digit pages:\n- 4's: 19\n- 8's: 19\n\nFrom three-digit pages:\n- 4's: 168\n- 8's: 78\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with single-digit: 1 each, correct.\n\nTwo-digit pages:\n- Units place: 9 each\n- Tens place: 10 each\nTotal: 19 each, correct.\n\nThree-digit pages:\n- Hundreds place: 89 4's, 0 8's\n- Tens place: 40 4's, 39 8's\n- Units place: 39 4's, 39 8's\nTotal 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\nTotal 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\nThat seems correct.\n\nAdding up all 4's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188\nAdding up all 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the three-digit tens place. When I was calculating the tens place for 400-488, I said that the tens digit 4 appears 10 times because of 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so yes, that's correct. And for 8's, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times because 480-488 is only 9 numbers. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place for 400-488, I correctly accounted for 9 4's and 9 8's. So, that seems right.\n\nWait, another way to check: let's calculate the total number of digits printed. From 1-9: 9 digits. From 10-99: 90 numbers \u00d7 2 digits = 180. From 100-488: 389 numbers \u00d7 3 digits = 1167. So, total digits: 9 + 180 + 1167 = 1356 digits.\n\nNow, the total number of 4's is 188 and 8's is 98. So, 188 + 98 = 286 digits accounted for, which is less than 1356, but that's okay because we're only counting 4's and 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made a mistake in the three-digit tens place. When I was calculating the tens place for 400-488, I considered that the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, that's 10 and 9 respectively. Then, for the other hundreds groups (100-199, etc.), each contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 3 \u00d7 10 each = 30 each. So, total tens place 4's: 30 + 10 = 40, and 8's: 30 + 9 = 39. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, each hundreds group contributes 10 4's and 10 8's, except the last group, which contributes 9 each. So, 3 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 39 each. That seems correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Single-Digit Pages (1-9):**\n   - **4's:** 1 (page 4)\n   - **8's:** 1 (page 8)\n   - **Difference:** 0\n\n2. **Two-Digit Pages (10-99):**\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Each digit (0-9) appears 9 times.\n     - **4's:** 9\n     - **8's:** 9\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - Each digit (1-9) appears 10 times in the tens place.\n     - **4's:** 10 (40-49)\n     - **8's:** 10 (80-89)\n   - **Total for Two-Digit Pages:**\n     - **4's:** 9 + 10 = 19\n     - **8's:** 9 + 10 = 19\n   - **Difference:** 0\n\n3. **Three-Digit Pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - Only pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place.\n     - **4's:** 89 (400-488)\n     - **8's:** 0\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - **100-199, 200-299, 300-399:** Each contributes 10 4's and 10 8's.\n     - **400-488:** 4 appears 10 times (440-449), 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n     - **Total 4's:** 3\u00d710 + 10 = 40\n     - **Total 8's:** 3\u00d710 + 9 = 39\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - **100-199, 200-299, 300-399:** Each contributes 10 4's and 10 8's.\n     - **400-488:** 9 4's and 9 8's.\n     - **Total 4's:** 3\u00d710 + 9 = 39\n     - **Total 8's:** 3\u00d710 + 9 = 39\n   - **Total for Three-Digit Pages:**\n     - **4's:** 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\n     - **8's:** 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n\n4. **Overall Totals:**\n   - **4's:** 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188\n   - **8's:** 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98\n   - **Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
