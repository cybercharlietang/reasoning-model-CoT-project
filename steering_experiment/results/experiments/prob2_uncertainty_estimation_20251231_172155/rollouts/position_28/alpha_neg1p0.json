    "text": " So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, let me add them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many numbers in each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. So, number of fours is 188, and number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

I'll do the same for the units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, the last number is 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers.

But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place as 8. Let's count: Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's 9 instead of 10. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, subtracting the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

The last set, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, that's 4 sets * 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9 = 49.

    "text": " That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see, the first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many sets? From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's.

    "text": " So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but wait, 488 is included, so it's 49 numbers. Wait, no, 8 to 488 in steps of 10: 8, 18, ..., 488. Let me check: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so the number of terms is floor(488/10) + 1 if 488 is included. Wait, 488 is 48*10 + 8, so yes, it's included. So, the count is 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the hundreds place as well, but for the tens place, it's just the tens digit being 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, but actually, 480-489 would be 10, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9. So, for the tens place, the count is 10 (80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, is that right? Wait, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9, so total 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, ..., 484.

Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers are there? The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, 480-489 would be the next, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's see how many numbers that is. Each full block (e.g., 80-89) has 10 numbers, so 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, so 40 numbers. Now, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights in each place: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that can't be right because 188 - 98 is 90. But let me double-check my counts because 90 seems a bit high. Let me verify the fours again. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The formula is floor((488 - 4)/10) + 1. So, (488 -4)/10 = 484/10=48.4, floor is 48, so 48 +1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 488 - 400 +1=89. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is included, so how many? (488 -8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, that's correct.

    "text": " So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which would mean 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, we have 49 fours in the units place. Tens place: each hundred block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. From 1-400, there are four blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the hundreds digit is 4, but the tens digit is 0-8. Wait, no, the tens digit in 401-488 is 0-8, so the tens digit being 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total tens place fours would be 4*10 (from 1-400) +10 (from 401-488) = 50 fours. Hundreds place: as before, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 +89= 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is within the book, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8 in the hundreds place. Wait, no, the tens digit being 8 is in the tens place, so 480-488 has 8 in the tens place. So, how many sets? From 1-400, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's four sets of 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place eights: 0. So total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me double-check the counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=188.

Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but we have to include 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.

So that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yes, that seems right.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the book, so let's count how many sets. Each full hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-488: the tens digit is 8, and the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many numbers here? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 for all these, so that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, etc.) plus 9 from 480-488. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but wait, 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9. So that's 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, but let me check again. Units: 49, tens:49, so total eights: 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts because I might have made a mistake. Let's recount the fours: units, tens, hundreds. Units: from 4,14,...,484. How many? 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Correct. Hundreds: 400-488: 89 numbers. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Correct. Now, eights: units: 8,18,...,488: 49 numbers. Tens: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. So, total eights: 49 +49=98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me check if I counted correctly. For example, in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4, so that's correct. For the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, I think the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, and the last set has 9 numbers, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Wait, no: 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 is 48*10 + 8, so yes, 49 times. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last, so 480-488 is 9 numbers). Wait, is that correct? 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, total tens place eights: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8.

The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The number of terms can be calculated as (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.

Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers.

So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours are 188, total eights are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. For the tens place in fours, I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50. That's correct because 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Units place for fours: 4,14,...,484. That's 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. That's correct. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 4 full sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) and one partial set from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. So, 49 in tens place. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct.

Yes, but our book goes up to 488, so 480-488 would be part of this. Let's see: Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 480 is the first, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers.

Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me double-check my calculations because 90 seems a bit high. Let me recount the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check that again. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers, correct. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, for the eights: units place is 49, tens place is 49, so total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check the tens place for 8's again. I had 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. That's 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, 49 in tens place for 8's, plus 49 in units place, total 98.\n\nWait, but wait, when counting the hundreds place for 4's, is it correct that from 400 to 488, there are 89 numbers? Let's see: 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, correct.\n\nWait, but another way to count the number of 4's in the hundreds place is to note that every number from 400 to 488 has 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the tens place for 4's. Let me recount that. For the tens digit being 4, we have:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149:10\n- 240-249:10\n- 340-349:10\n- 440-449:10\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. So, that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for the units place, from 4,14,...484: that's 49 numbers, as 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 fours in the units place.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,...488: 49 numbers.\n\nTens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 +49=98.\n\nThus, 188 -98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check again for the units place of 4's. The first 4 is at 4, then every 10 numbers. So, from 4 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? The last such number is 484, as 488 ends with 8, so 484 is the last one. So, from 4 to 484, how many steps of 10? Let's see: (484 -4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, correct, 49 fours in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place: last number is 488, so (488 -8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, correct.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** \n   - 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 numbers (from 4 to 484, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens place:** \n   - 40-49: 10 numbers\n   - 140-149: 10\n   - 240-249: 10\n   - 340-349: 10\n   - 440-449: 10\n   - Total: 50 numbers.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** \n   - 400-488: 89 numbers.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** \n   - 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This sequence has 49 numbers.\n\n2. **Tens place:** \n   - 80-89: 10 numbers\n   - 180-189: 10\n   - 280-289: 10\n   - 380-389: 10\n   - 480-488: 9 numbers\n   - Total: 49 numbers.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** \n   - None, as the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488. Let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. Each 10 numbers contribute one 8 in the units place. From 1-488, there are 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20,...,481-490), but 488 is in the 48th decade? Wait, no, 488 is in the 480-489 range, which is the 49th set. Wait, actually, 1-10 is the first, 11-20 the second, ..., 481-490 is the 49th. But since we're only going up to 488, that's 488 - 480 +1 = 9 numbers in the 480-488 range. So, the units place 8 occurs once in each of the 49 decades (1-10 up to 480-489), but since we're stopping at 488, the last decade only has 9 numbers, but the 8 still occurs once in the units place at 488. So, total units place 8's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8 in the hundreds place. Let me check each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place. - 180-189: 10 numbers, 10 8's. - 280-289: 10 numbers, 10 8's. - 380-389: 10 numbers, 10 8's. - 480-488: Here, the hundreds digit is 4, and the tens digit is 8, so the numbers are 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here. So total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm wondering if I counted correctly for the tens place of 4's. Wait, in the tens place, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50. But 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. For 8's in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set has only 9 numbers, so 9 instead of 10. So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9: 4*10 +9=49. That seems right. So, the difference is indeed 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place for numbers 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place for numbers 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences except the last, which contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. Wait, let me check: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many numbers in each set: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no hundreds digits of 8 in this book. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights from each place: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are there than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the units place for 4's, I thought of it as 484/10=48.4, but then realized it's 49 because it includes both 4 and 484. Similarly, for 8's, units place goes up to 488, which is 49 numbers. So, that seems correct. For the tens place of 4's, I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50. But wait, 400-488 includes the hundreds place, but when considering the tens place, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only for 400-409, 410-419, etc., but actually, in the hundreds place, the numbers from 400-488 have their hundreds digit as 4, but the tens digit cycles through 0-9. Wait, but when counting the tens digit as 4, it's 400-409, 410-419, etc., but no, that's not right. Wait, no, the tens digit is 4 in the numbers 400-409, 440-449, etc. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me correct that. Actually, the tens digit is 4 in the hundreds place when the number is between 400-488. So, the tens digit is 4 in the numbers 400-409, 440-449, 480-489, but wait, 480-489 would have the tens digit as 8, not 4. Wait, no, the tens digit is the second digit from the right. So, for example, 400 has tens digit 0, 401 has 0, ..., 409 has 9. Then 410 has 1, 411 has 1, ..., 419 has 9, and so on. So, the tens digit is 4 in the hundreds place when the number is between 400-409? No, wait, that's not right. Wait, no, the tens digit is the second digit. So, for 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, but the tens digit can be 0-8. So, when the tens digit is 4, it's from 440-449. That's 10 numbers: 440-449. So, in the hundreds place, the tens digit is 4 only once, from 440-449. So, that's 10 numbers. So, earlier, I thought that in the tens place, the 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, etc., which is correct, but in the hundreds place, the tens digit being 4 is only in 440-449. Wait, but I think I made a mistake earlier when counting the tens place for 4's. Let me re-examine that. The tens digit is 4 in the following ranges: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. So, that part was correct. Now, for the hundreds place, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, as calculated before. So, that's correct. So, the total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. For 8's: units place is 49, tens place is 49, and hundreds place is 0, so total 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought that in the hundreds place, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, but that's in the tens place, not the hundreds. So, the hundreds place is only for the hundreds digit. So, I think my initial count was correct. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, that's 10 +10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but wait: 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. So, total number of eights is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set has 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that is. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 count? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, let's count how many sets we have. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-488 is part of the hundreds place, so the tens digit here is 8, but we need to count how many numbers from 480-488 have 8 in the tens place. That's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, the tens place has 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus the 9 numbers in 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.

So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. But wait, did I count correctly in the tens place for fours? Let me check again. For fours in the tens place: numbers from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 5*10=50. That's correct. And for eights in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set is only 9 numbers, so 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49. Correct. So, the difference is indeed 188-98=90. I think that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference between them.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 numbers here.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? Let me calculate 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8. Let's see: Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, actually, the tens digit is 8 for all numbers from 480 to 489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (from 80-89, etc.) and one block of 9. So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me double-check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yep, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we'll count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 blocks.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 89.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each block of 100 contributes 10, except the last block which contributes 9.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No pages from 800-899.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but let's check the last number. 488 is included, so how many numbers? From 8 to 488 with step 10: that's (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.

So, total in tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.

Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 numbers (including 488). So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389.

Wait, let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the tens place for fours again. From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, so 5*10=50. Correct. For eights, tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Units place for fours: 4,14,...,484. How many? Let's see, from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Units place for eights: 8,18,...,488. Similarly, (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Hundreds place for fours: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct. Hundreds place for eights: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488. So, yes, the total fours are 188, eights are 98, so 188-98=90.

So total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8.

Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n  \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in every 10th number, starting from 8 up to 488. This gives 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each full block contributes 10 occurrences, and the partial block 480-488 contributes 9, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, no, wait: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's see how many numbers are in each set. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, total in tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For the 4's: units place: 4,14,...,484: that's 484/10 = 48.4, but since 484 is included, it's 49. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449: that's 5 sets, each 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89. Total 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488: 488/10=48.8, so 49. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Hundreds place: none, so 0. Total 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct. Maybe I can check another way. Alternatively, think of each digit position separately. For units place: 4 appears 49 times, 8 appears 49 times. Tens place: 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times. Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times. So, the difference is (49+50+89) - (49+49+0) = 188 - 98 = 90. Yeah, that seems consistent.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.
