    "text": " Wait, does the hundreds digit being 4 only occur in the range 400-488? Yes, because 488 is the last page. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in each of these 89 numbers, the hundreds digit is 4. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but I'm not sure if I'm including all correctly. Let me think again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, is that right? Let me check: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488: that's 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 eights. So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, in the tens place, I thought it was 49, but let me double-check. From 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, total eights are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's. Let me go through the 4's again. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10,140-149:10,240-249:10,340-349:10,440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488:89 numbers. So, 89. Total 4's:49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, for 8's: Units place:8,18,...,488:49 numbers. Tens place:80-89:10,180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. So, 10*4 +9=49. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). This results in 49 occurrences (from 4 to 484, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all page numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). This results in 49 occurrences (from 8 to 488, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last range contributes 9, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book only goes up to 488.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488. So how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. So total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see: The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. To find how many, I can do 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48. But wait, 488 is included, so it's 49 occurrences, right? Because 8, 18, ..., 488. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. So total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Wait, does the hundreds digit only start at 100, so 100-199 have 1 in the hundreds place, 200-299 have 2, etc. So, 400-488 would have 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 0, it's 0-488, so 488 is the 49th 8 in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is the last set. Let me count how many numbers in each set. Each full set (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers, so 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 full sets (each 10) and one partial set with 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For 4's: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99+89=188. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems right, but let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for 4's and 8's. For 4's in tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, so 5*10=50. Correct. For 8's in tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Units place: for both 4 and 8, they each appear 49 times because the last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place counts are correct. Hundreds place for 4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct. Hundreds place for 8's: none, correct. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488 \u2192 0 times.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Wait, but I'm only counting the hundreds place, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the fours in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488.

So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, contributing 10 eights each. The last set, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), so 9 eights in the tens place. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8.

From 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4*10 +9=49. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so total eights: 98.\n\nWait, earlier I thought the units place had 49 eights, but let me check that again. Units place: 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The sequence is 8 + 10*(n-1) \u2264 488. So, 8 +10(n-1) \u2264488 \u219210(n-1) \u2264480 \u2192n-1 \u226448 \u2192n\u226449. So, 49 terms. So, units place has 49 eights.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the units place had 49 eights and the tens place had 49, so total 98 eights.\n\nWait, but when I counted fours, I had 188 fours. So, the number of fours minus the number of eights would be 188 -98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n\nBut let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, fours:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,...,484. The sequence is 4 +10k, where k=0 to 48, so 49 terms. So, 49 fours.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 5*10=50 fours.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours: 49+50+89=188.\n\nEights:\n\n- Units place:8,18,...,488. As above, 49 eights.\n\n- Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 eights, the last block has 9 eights. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights.\n\n- Hundreds place: none, as 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188 fours -98 eights=90 more fours.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 4's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - Total 4's: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total 4's: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in numbers 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four blocks contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Last block (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (as 800-899 exceeds 488).\n   - Total 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, the first three-digit number is 100, so the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 page numbers. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. Let's count how many. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 also count? But the book goes only up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, how many sets of 10 are there? From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, as 488 - 480 +1 = 9). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800 or above, but the book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total.

    "text": " Wait, does 400 count as a page? Yes, because the book has 488 pages, so 400 is included. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have a 4 in the hundreds place? That's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). Wait, no. Wait, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add them up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll go through each digit position again. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets we have. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers). Wait, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units place, I had 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, so 98. So, 188 - 98 is indeed 90. Hmm, but let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly for fours? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers, right? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place. For the tens place in fours, I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Units place: 49. So, 188 fours. For eights: units 49, tens 49, so 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Let me think: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Wait, no, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, 99 + 89 is actually 188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 occurrences, right? Because 488 is included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see: each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but our book goes up to 488, so 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the hundreds place, 480-488 is part of the 400s, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers here. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the number of fours is 188 and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of fours is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours.

So, how many 8's in the units place? The first is 8, the last is 488. To find how many, I can do (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.

So, that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought there might be 98 eights. But let me double-check. Wait, in the tens place, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, so total 98. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the 4's. Let me recount the 4's: Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. That's correct. Tens place: 40-49:10,140-149:10,240-249:10,340-349:10,440-449:10. Wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but the book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included. So, 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, 89. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. When counting the 8's in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers (from 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers). Wait, no: 480 is the first, then 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers. So, 9 eights in the tens place for 480-488. So, that part is correct. So, total 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when counting digits, especially in the hundreds place, I might have made a mistake. Let me think again. For the 4's in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Correct. So, 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. For 8's, units:49, tens:49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, I think that's correct.

    "text": " Let me think: from 400 to 488, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but let me check: units place: 4,14,...484 is 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449: that's 5 sets of 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me check if I missed any. For example, in the hundreds place, 400-488 is correct, right? Yes. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in 8,18,28,38,... up to 488. Let's see: the last number is 488, so the units digit 8 appears in 8,18,...488. How many? The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full steps, but including 8 itself, so 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is included, so 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. But wait, does 380-389 fall within 488? Yes, because 389 is less than 488. Also, is there a 480-489? Yes, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 in 480-488 is also valid. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 40. But wait, from 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488. That's 9 numbers: 480,481,...488. So, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) plus 9 in 480-488. So, 4*10 +9 =49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but wait: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is another 10, 380-389 is another 10, and then 480-488 is 9. So, total 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, so total 8's are 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 188. For the 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0, total 98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the tens place for 4's again. I had 5 sets of 10: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets, so 5*10=50. Yes, that's correct. And for the 8's, in the tens place, 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last one is only 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49. Correct. So, the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit from the right):** The digit 4 appears in numbers 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Wait, because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? The formula is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Each full set (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers, so that's 4 full sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Now, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, that's 9 more eights. So, total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place for 4's, I considered 440-449 as a full set, which is correct because 440-449 is within 488. So, 5 sets of 10, which is 50. For the tens place of 8's, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the first four are full (10 each) and the last one is 9. So, 4*10 + 9=49. So, that's correct. Wait, but in the hundreds place for 8's, I thought it's 0, but actually, 800-899 would be the hundreds digit as 8, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484), totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449, totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488), totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488, totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me think. From 400 to 488, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, but let's see. The numbers ending with 8 go from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last occurrence is at 488. How many such numbers? Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) + 1. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is the last set. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For the eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, let me check the tens place for fours again. I said that in the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's 5 sets of 10, making 50 fours in the tens place. That's correct. For the eights in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set is only 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49. That's correct. So, the difference is indeed 90.

Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so that's 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

    "text": " Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of fours is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. To find the count, I can divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48, but let's check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Since 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 8. Wait, 8 is the first, 18 the second, ..., 488 would be the (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49th. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many sets of 100 have 8 in the tens place. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 from 480-488. So that's 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total number of eights is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's printed are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 times.

Let's count how many sets. Each set is 10 numbers. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me double-check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49.

So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, wait, let me double-check that. Units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds:89. 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Okay, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are.

So, 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10*4 +9 = 40 +9=49.

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 +49 +0=98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) -98 (eights) =90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.

Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 eights in the tens place for that set.

So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total fours are 188, total eights are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, in the units place for fours, I thought it was 49, but let me confirm. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, which gives 48 fours, but since 488 is included, the last set is 480-488, which includes 484 as the 49th occurrence. So, units place fours: 49. Similarly, for eights in units place: 488/10=48.8, so 49 eights. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place for fours: each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place, so from 40-49, 140-149, etc. Up to 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50 fours. That seems correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place for fours: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. That adds up to 49+50+89=188 fours.\n\nFor eights: units place is 49, tens place is 49, as we have 5 sets of 10, but the last set only has 9, so 4*10 +9=49. Hundreds place is 0. So, total eights: 98.\n\nSo, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

So, in the hundreds place, only 400-499 would have 4 in the hundreds place, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 400-488. So, the number of fours in the hundreds place is 89. So, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484: 484/10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449: 5 sets of 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many such numbers. The last one is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that right? Let me think: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So total is 10*4 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 in the hundreds place would be in numbers 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, but let me double-check the counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, plus 89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set has 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four sets have 10 each, and the last set has 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, but page numbers go up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of fours is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last occurrence is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers except maybe the last one. Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of eights is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, did I do that right? Let me double-check. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but wait, 400-488 includes 400, 401, ..., 488. So, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours here. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The formula is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. That's correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10, and there are 5 hundreds (0-400, 100-200, etc.), but wait, 400-499 would be the fifth hundred, but our book goes only up to 488, so does that affect the tens place? Wait, no, because in the tens place, 40-49 is in the first hundred, 140-149 in the second, etc., up to 440-449 in the fifth hundred. So, 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. That's correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8. So, each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers except possibly the last one. Let's see: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 489 is beyond 488). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, totaling 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so yes, 9 eights in the tens place. So total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. That seems correct. But wait, let me check the tens place for fours again. I thought it was 5 sets of 10, but wait, 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50 fours. That's correct. For eights, in the tens place, we have 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49. That's correct.

So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Wait, but does that include the 400-488 range? Yes, because each of those 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, adding up the hundreds, tens, and units places: 89 (hundreds) + 50 (tens) + 49 (units) = 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, the last occurrence is at 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. Wait, no: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10.

So, 40 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 98 eights in total. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98.

Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, when I was counting the units place for 4's, I thought it was 49, but let me check again. From 4, 14, 24,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 +1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nFor the tens place of 4's: 40-49, 140-149, etc., each has 10 numbers, and there are 5 such sets (from 0-400, 100-500, etc.), so 5*10=50. That seems right.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total 4's: 49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Correct.\n\nTens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: none, so 0. So total 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488.

Wait, but actually, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is always 4, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. So total number of fours is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but wait, let me check again. Units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. So total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, checking each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number is 488, so how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. So units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So each set from 80-89, 180-189, etc., has 10 numbers, but the last one only goes up to 488, so that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no: 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 9 numbers. So, let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Therefore, total number of eights is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.

So, how many such numbers are there? Let's see: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The last number is 488, which is 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. Let's solve for n: 8 + 10(n-1) = 488 \u2192 10(n-1) = 480 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n=49.

Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480 +1 =9. So, the first four sets (80-89, etc.) have 10 each, and the last set (480-488) has 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights are units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0=98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) -98 (eights)=90.

So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but I'm not sure if I counted correctly. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but the 48th ten would end at 480, so the next number ending with 4 is 484, which is within 488. So, that's 49 numbers, so 49 fours in the units place. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, so 5*10=50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total 49+50+89=188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Numbers ending with 8 from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is included. So, the last number ending with 8 is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Numbers where the tens digit is 8. These are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so that's 9 numbers. So, let's count each set: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, total eights in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 +9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can't be 8 because 800 is beyond 488. So, no eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that seems off. Wait, units place: 49 eights, tens place:49 eights, so total 98 eights. Now, number of fours is 188, number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counting because 90 seems like a big difference. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours or something. Let me recount the fours. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full sets, but 48*10=480, so 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 fours in units. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each 10 numbers, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488: how many numbers? 488 -400 +1=89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. Now, eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Hundreds place: none, so 0. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, difference is 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm not sure if I counted correctly for the tens place in eights. Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. That's correct because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, 49 eights in tens place. So, total eights:49+49=98. Fours:188. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me try another approach. Maybe I can count the number of times each digit appears in each position. For units place: for 4, it's every 10 numbers, so 488//10=48 full cycles, and then check if the remainder includes another 4. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so the last 4 in units place is at 484, which is 48*10 +4=484. So, 49 fours in units. For 8 in units place, same logic: 488//10=48, and the last 8 is at 488, so 49 eights. For tens place: For 4, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4, so from 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks up to 488: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each contributes 10, so 5*10=50 fours. For 8 in tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. That's 5 blocks, but the last block is only 9 numbers. So, 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, so 4*10 +9=49 eights. For hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. 8 in hundreds place: none, as 800 is beyond 488. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Total eights:49+49=98. So, difference is 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me check how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be the next, but since the book ends at 488, we only go up to 488. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, as 488 is the last). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total 8's printed: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For the 4's: units place had 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, totaling 188. For the 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, totaling 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Yes, that seems right. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10 occurrences.\n   - There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contributing 10 occurrences.\n   - There are 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and an incomplete block 480-488 with 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Final Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think. From 400 to 488, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Wait, but wait, from 400 to 488, every number has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? Let's see. The last number is 488, so 488 \u00f710 =48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, 8,18,...,488. Let me check: 488 -8 =480, 480 \u00f710=48, so there are 49 numbers (including both 8 and 488). So, units place:49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, when I was counting the tens place, I thought 480-488 is 9 numbers, but 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), which is 9 numbers, so 480-488:9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) and 480-488:9. So, total eights in tens place:4\u00d710 +9=49. So, total eights:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, now, the number of fours is 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each place again. For fours: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any numbers. Let me think about the hundreds place for fours: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct. For the tens place in fours: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Correct. Units place for fours: every 10 numbers, starting at 4, so 4,14,...,484. How many? Let's see: 484 \u00f710=48.4, so 48 full tens, but including 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49. Correct. For eights: units place:8,18,...,488. 488 is included, so 488 \u00f710=48.8, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So, total eights in tens place:49. Correct. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   There are 49 such numbers.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.  \n   Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188 fours**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   There are 49 such numbers.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.  \n   The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last range contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book only goes up to 488.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98 eights**\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 fours - 98 eights = **90**\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

Wait, but let me think: the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488.

So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9 (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total.

I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488.

How many terms? The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 count? But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 would be part of that. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me double-check. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. That's (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49.

Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: Each hundred block has 10, and there are 5 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so does that affect the tens place? Let me think. From 40-49: 10 fours, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So that's 5 sets, each with 10 fours in the tens place, so 50. So that's correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in hundreds place, so 89. So total fours: 49 + 50 +89= 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, does 488 count? Yes, because 488 is the last page. So, how many terms? The first is 8, last is 488. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of it. So, each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except maybe the last one. Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 eights in the tens place for 480-488. So total eights in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) and 9 from 480-488. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check if I made a mistake somewhere. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I think I might have overcounted in the hundreds place for fours. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. And in the tens place, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 fours in the tens place. So, yes, 50 in tens. Units place 49. So, 188 fours. For eights, units 49, tens 49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for eights. Let me recount the tens place for eights. Each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: how many? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers:480,481,...,488. So, in the tens place, 480-488: the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, so that's 9 eights. So, total tens eights:4*10 +9=49. Correct. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 only in 400-499, but our book stops at 488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which would be 49 numbers. Wait, but does 488 count? Yes, because it's 488, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many sets there are. Each hundred has one set of 10, except maybe the last one. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9.

So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, I think that's correct.

    "text": " Wait, because the book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours in total. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Wait, from 1 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is indeed 89 numbers. The tens digit: 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each of those is 10 numbers, and there are 5 such decades, so 50. Units digit: 4,14,24,...,484. That's 49 numbers because 484 is the 49th multiple. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so how many 8's in the units place? Let's see: The first is 8, then 18, 28,..., up to 488. To find how many, divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full tens. But 488 is the 49th occurrence because it's 8 in the units place. So, 49 eights in the units place. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in decades like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Each full decade (like 80-89) has 10 numbers, so that's 5 full decades (80s, 180s, 280s, 380s, 480s). Wait, but in the 480s, it only goes up to 488, so that's 9 numbers: 480-488. So, for the tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total eights in tens place: 10 +10+10+10+9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that's 49 + 49 = 98. But let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, yes, 49. Units place: 49. So, total eights: 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me check again. Wait, wait, earlier when I was counting the fours in the hundreds place, I thought it was 89, but let me confirm: from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Then, tens place: 50, units:49, total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems a bit high. Let me see if I made a mistake in counting. Maybe in the units place for fours, I overcounted? Wait, from 4 to 484, how many steps of 10? 484 /10 = 48.4, so 48 full steps, but 484 is the 49th. So, 49 fours in units place. Similarly, for eights, 8 to 488, same thing: 488/10=48.8, so 49 eights in units place. Okay, that's correct. Tens place for fours: 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. For eights, tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last one only has 9 numbers, so 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total eights in tens place:49. So, total eights:49+49=98. Fours:49+50+89=188. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct.

So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total.

The first is 8, the last is 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers.

    "text": " Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers. Wait, no, 488 is the last page, so from 400 to 488, inclusive. Let me calculate how many numbers that is. 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total fours would be units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, which would give 48 fours, but since 488 is included, the 49th four is at 484. So, units place is 49 fours. Tens place: each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place, so from 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10. So, total tens place fours are 40 + 10 = 50. That's correct. Hundreds place: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, which would give 48 eights, but since 488 is included, that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many sets? From 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Therefore, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"
