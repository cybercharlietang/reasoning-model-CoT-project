    "text": " So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours printed. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll check each place: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let's check: starting at 8, each 10 numbers adds one. So from 8 to 488, how many? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, but the last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, and the last set (480-488) has 9 numbers. So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights printed. Now, to find how many more fours than eights there are: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. This is 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488.

Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours in total. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The formula is floor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10) = 48.9, so 48 times? Wait, but when I count from 4 to 484, each step is 10, so 4 is the first, 14 the second, ..., 484 is the 49th. So, 49 fours in the units place. Similarly, in the tens place, each hundred block has 10 fours, and there are 5 hundred blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but in the last block, 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only up to 449. From 450-488, the tens digit is 5,6,...,8, so the tens digit is 4 only up to 449. So, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, yes, 89 fours there. Now, for the tens place, each hundred has 10 fours, but the last hundred (400-488) only goes up to 449 for the tens digit being 4. So, 400-449 is 50 numbers, but wait, 400-449 is 50 numbers, but the tens digit being 4 is from 400-409, 410-419, etc. Wait, no, in the tens place, 400-409 is 10 numbers where the tens digit is 0, but the hundreds digit is 4. Wait, no, I'm confusing. Let me clarify: in the tens place, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in 0-99, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49: 10 numbers. Similarly, in 100-199, it's 140-149: 10 numbers. Same for 200-299: 240-249, and 300-399: 340-349. Now, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449: that's another 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. So, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total fours: 49+50+89=188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, step 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only up to 488, so the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's see: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of '4's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit '4' appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 50 such occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of '8's:**\n   - **Units place:** The digit '8' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit '8' appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 49 such occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have '8' in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Wait, but wait, the hundreds digit is only 4 from 400 to 499, but our book ends at 488, so it's 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, which would give 48 eights. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Because 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. Let me check: 8 is the first, 18 is the second, ..., 488 is the 49th. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, is that correct? 480 to 488 is 9 numbers? Let me count: 480 is the first, then 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers. So, the tens place for 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, etc.) and one block of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but wait: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, total is 40 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This is 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - This is 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This is 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n   - This contributes 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers.

So, the tens place has 4 sets of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) and then 9 numbers in 480-488. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers (except maybe the last one) contributes 10 eights.

Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, so fours are 188 and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours printed than eights. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.

Wait, actually, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers, so in 1-100, 10-19, 10-19? Wait no, 40-49 is the first set. Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.

So total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, we'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488.

So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, from 480 to 488 inclusive). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. This results in 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in numbers 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488, resulting in 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n\nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is included, so units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units place: 4,14,...,484. That's from 4 to 484, which is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488:89 numbers. Correct. So 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place:8,18,...,488: same as fours, 49. Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Hundreds place:0. So 49+49=98. Difference:188-98=90. Wait, that seems correct.

Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total.

Yes, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of this. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers, except maybe the last one if it's cut short.

Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included. So, starting from 8, 18, ..., 488. How many numbers is that? Let me see: The first is 8, and the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49.

But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 is the last page). Wait, no: 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count each set. - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights. - 180-189: 10 eights. - 280-289: 10 eights. - 380-389: 10 eights. - 480-488: From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights here. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 89.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences except the last block, which has 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 =89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits with 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check again. Wait, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, units place is 49, tens is 49, so total eights are 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake. For fours: units place, 49 seems correct because from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers, so 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 5 sets of 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 89 numbers from 400-488. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place, 49 because from 8 to 488, every 10 numbers, so 488/10=48.8, so 49. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10*4=40 +9=49. So, 49 in tens. So, total eights: 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, and then an extra 4 in 484, making it 49. That's correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. There are 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, actually, from 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. Then 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. That's correct. Hundreds place: From 400-488: 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, and then 488 itself is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 380-389 is within 488, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so only up to 488. So, let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10, so 40 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (40) = 89 eights. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 - 89 = 99. Wait, that can't be right because I thought initially it would be 99, but let me check again. Wait, when I counted the fours in the hundreds place, I had 89 numbers from 400-488, which is correct because 488 - 400 +1 = 89. But when I counted the eights in the tens place, I considered 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 380-389, which is 4 sets, each with 10, so 40. That seems correct. Units place for eights: 488 is included, so 49 eights. So total eights: 49 + 40 = 89. Fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188. So, 188 - 89 = 99. So, there are 99 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly? For the fours in the tens place, I had 5 sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), which is 5*10=50. That's correct. For the eights in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, which is 4 sets, each with 10, so 40. That's correct. So, the difference is indeed 99.

    "text": " So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, let me add them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Hmm, actually, in the units place, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus the last partial cycle which has one more 4 (at 484), so 49. That seems correct. For the tens place, each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, and there are 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, actually, 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but the tens digit being 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, from 0-488, we have 5 sets of 100, but the last set (400-488) only goes up to 488, but the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 5 sets of 10, which is 50. That seems correct. For the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's.

Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488), but the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 numbers. Wait, no: 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, each hundred has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except the last one, which has 9. So, from 0-488, how many sets of 100 do we have? 400-488 is the fifth set, but only 9 numbers in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that can't be right because when I calculated units, I included 488, which is the 49th occurrence, and in the tens place, I have 49 as well. So total eights would be 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check the counts because I might have made a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, plus 89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me think again about the tens place for eights. From 0-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? It's in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. So, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Fours: 188. So, 188 - 98 = 90.

Now, adding up all the fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. Wait, let me confirm: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 8, 18, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. Let's count each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189: 10 - 280-289:10 - 380-389:10 - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, adding these up: 10 + 10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let me check the tens place again. Wait, when I calculated the tens place, I included 480-488 as 9 numbers. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, correct. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. For the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers, right? So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. So, 50 in the tens place. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? Let's see, 484 is the last one. So, from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1 =48+1=49. So, 49 in the units place. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. How many? 488 is included, so ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90.

So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, 8, 18, ..., 488: how many? Let's see, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is the 49th, yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, each set except the last one has 10 numbers. Let's count: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours printed. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8 can appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're counting whole numbers, it's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is included, so that's correct. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens digit being 8. The numbers would be 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets do we have? From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights here. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Wait, that seems off. Let me double-check the tens place. When I count 80-89, that's 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. That's correct. So, total eights are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That's correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I feel like maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Wait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct because 488-400+1=89. So, that's right. Similarly, for the tens place in fours, I had 50, which is 10 each for 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets, so 5*10=50. Correct. For eights, the tens place was 49 because the last set was only 9 numbers. So, 49 eights in tens place, plus 49 in units, totaling 98. So, 188-98=90.

Now, let's add them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Yes, because 8*49=392, but wait, 488 is the last page. Wait, no, 8 in units place goes up to 488, which is 488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's see: from 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480-488), because 489 would be beyond 488. Wait, but 480-489 is 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so that's 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 in 480-488. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times.

Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Wait, 400 to 488 is indeed 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. Units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48 fours, plus the 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So units place is 49 fours. Tens place: each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, in 1-100: 40-49, that's 10. 101-200: 140-149, another 10. 201-300: 240-249, another 10. 301-400: 340-349, another 10. 401-488: 440-449, which is 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many times that happens. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing an 8 in the units place, so 48 eights. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488 is 49 numbers. Let me check: starting at 8, each 10 numbers adds one, so from 8 to 488, that's (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check the tens place again. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. So total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that's a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Hmm, that seems plausible, but I want to make sure I didn't overcount anywhere. Let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. And for the tens place, each hundred has 10 fours, and since there are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), but wait, 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's fine. So, 5 sets of 10, 50 fours. Units place: 49 fours. So, 188 fours. For eights, units place: 49, tens place:49, so 98 eights. So, the difference is indeed 90.

Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) and 9 in the last set. So, 4*10 +9 =49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that's 49+49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that's 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights. Hmm, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place was 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This gives 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but including 488, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's see how many numbers that is. Each full block (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, so that's 4 blocks (80s, 180s, 280s, 380s) each contributing 10 eights, so 40. Then, the last block is 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, 40 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, but wait a second. Let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me check: 400-488 is 89 numbers, but each of these has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but wait: from 8, 18, ..., 488. Let me check: 488 is the 49th number because 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, and then 8 more, so 49 times. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me make sure: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total is 10*4 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Units place: 8,18,28,...,488: that's 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total eights are 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, but earlier I thought units place had 49 and tens place 49, so 98 total. So, 98 eights. Now, the number of fours was 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but that seems high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I feel like I might have made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Let me check again. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 fours. So, that's correct. For the tens place in fours, I had 50. Let me see: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. Correct. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many? 484 /10 =48.4, so 49 numbers. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place:49, tens place:49, correct. So, 98 eights. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. But when I count the tens place for fours, I included 440-449, which is within 488, so that's correct. Now, for the eights, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, the difference is indeed 90. Wait, but I feel like 90 is a lot. Let me think again. Maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let me recount the fours in the hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. That's correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, 50 fours. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place:8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers. Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, seems correct.

Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but we need to check if 488 is included. Yes, 488 is the last page, so the units digit is 8 there. So, starting from 8, 18, ..., 488. How many numbers is that? From 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, which means 49 numbers because 488 is included. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Let me confirm: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So, 488 is the 49th number. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9.

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49 + 49 = 98. But let me check again because sometimes I might have made a mistake. Units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, 49 in the tens place. So total eights: 49+49=98. Wait, but earlier I thought 488 is included in the units place, which it is, so units place is 49, tens place is 49, so total eights are 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake with inclusive counts. For the units place of fours: from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. For tens place of fours: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 488-400+1=89. Correct. So, fours total:49+50+89=188. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. Number of terms: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0.

I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me check the last occurrence: 488 is included. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is the last page, it's the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 8,18,...,488.

    "text": " So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me check how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 49 occurrences because 488 is the 49th number. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 fall within 488? Yes, up to 488. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see how many such blocks we have. From 1-400: there are 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 eights. So that's 4*10=40. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, we have 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, there are 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights, I subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, which gives 48 eights. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8. Let's count each block. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 = 40, plus 9 is 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that can't be right because when I did the units place for fours, I thought it was 49, and for eights, also 49, but maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me double-check the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct. For the tens place, I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours. Units place: 49 fours. So, 89 + 50 + 49 = 188. For eights: units place is 49, tens place is 49, so total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but wait, when I counted the tens place for eights, I had 480-488 as 9 numbers, so 480,481,...,488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) and one set of 9, so 49. That seems correct. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but let me check another way. Maybe I'm overcounting somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider each digit position separately and ensure I'm not missing anything. Let me recount the fours: units, tens, hundreds. Units: from 4,14,...,484. That's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. Correct. Tens: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds: 400-488:89 numbers. So, 89 fours. Total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, eights: units: 8,18,...,488. That's (488 -8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Correct. Hundreds: none. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because when I thought about the hundreds place for fours, 400-488 is 89 numbers, but does that include 488? Yes, because 488-400+1=89. So, correct. Similarly, for the tens place in eights, 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, that's correct.

Hmm, but let me check again. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. That's 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449: 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers.

The last number is 488, which is 488/10 = 48.8, so 49 numbers (including 8 and 488). So units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 fall within 488? Yes, up to 488. So let's count each set. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9.

So tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.

    "text": " So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of fours is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, starting at 8, the last occurrence in the units place is 488. How many numbers? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but does 488 count as the 49th? Let's check: 8,18,...,488. Yes, 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 fall within our range? Yes, up to 488. So, each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: how many? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers here. So, total in tens place is 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let me check the tens place again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 =90. Wait, that can't be right because I think I might have made a mistake in counting. Let me double-check. For fours: units place: from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers, which is (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488:89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. That's (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Hundreds place: none, so 0. So, eights total 49+49=98. So, difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but I thought earlier that the answer might be 90, but let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is correct because 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours in hundreds place. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for eights would have some, but no, since the book only goes up to 488, which is less than 800, so no page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place. So, the final answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488 (9 numbers).\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count each block. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10 + 10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits with 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems off. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for fours. Let me check again. When counting the tens place for fours, I considered 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. That seems correct. For eights in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49.

    "text": " So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. Wait, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me check: 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, n = (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 480/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, each block from 0-99, 100-199, etc., has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block which might be incomplete. Let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Yes. And for eights, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights there.
