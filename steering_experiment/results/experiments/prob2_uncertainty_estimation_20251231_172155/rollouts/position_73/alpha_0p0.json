    "text": " Correct. - Hundreds place: 0. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188 -98=90. Wait, but I'm wondering if I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. But does 488 count as a 4 in the hundreds place? Yes, because 488 is 400 + 88, so the hundreds digit is 4. So, 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, 188 total fours, 98 eights, so 90 more fours. So, the answer should be 90. But wait, let me check again because sometimes when counting, it's easy to miscount. Let me verify the units place for 4's. From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, (484-4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. For the tens place, 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, 10 each, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place:400-488:89. So, 188. For 8's, units place:8,18,...,488. So, 488-8=480, 480/10=48, +1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yes, that seems correct.

Did I count the hundreds place correctly for 4's? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Yes, that's correct. For 8's, the hundreds place doesn't contribute anything because the book doesn't reach 800. So, yes, 98 eights in total. So, 188-98=90. That seems right. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449). Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in numbers 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488). The last block (480-488) has 9 occurrences. Total = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
