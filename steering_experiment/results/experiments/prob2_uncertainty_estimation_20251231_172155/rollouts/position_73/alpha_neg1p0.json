I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference between their counts.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each block of 100 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488), totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each block of 100 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), except the last block which ends at 488, giving 9 numbers. This totals 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** Subtract the number of '8's from the number of '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Did I count correctly in the tens place for 8's? 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. That's 5 sets, but the last set has only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, yes, 98 eights. So, 188-98=90.
