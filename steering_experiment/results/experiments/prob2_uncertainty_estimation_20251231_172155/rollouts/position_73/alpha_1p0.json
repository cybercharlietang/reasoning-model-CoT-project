    "text": " Maybe that's correct. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last. So, yes, 9. So, total 49. So, 8's: 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me check another way. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as how many times each digit appears in each position. Let me try that approach for units, tens, and hundreds. For units digit: For 488 pages, the units digit cycles every 10. So, total number of 4's in units place is floor(488/10) if the last digit is less than 4, but since 488 ends with 8, which is higher than 4, it's floor(488/10) +1? Wait, no, the formula is usually floor((n - d)/10) +1, where d is the digit we're looking for. So, for units digit 4: floor((488 -4)/10) +1 = floor(484/10) +1 =48 +1=49. Correct. Similarly, for 8's in units place: floor((488 -8)/10)+1= floor(480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. For tens digit: For 4's in tens place, it's similar. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers with tens digit 4. So, how many complete blocks of 100 are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last block, 401-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449. So, 10 more. So, total 50. Wait, but 488 is beyond 449, so from 440-449, that's 10 numbers, so total 50. Correct. For 8's in tens place: Each block of 100 has 10 numbers with tens digit 8. So, 4 blocks give 40. Then, in the last block, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total 40 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds digit: For 4's, it's from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. For 8's, it's zero, as before. So, yes, 188 fours and 98 eights. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " Wait, that's 49. So, units and tens both have 49, so total 98. Correct. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's right. Maybe I should check another way. Alternatively, I can think about how many times each digit appears in each position. For units digit: For 488 pages, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 pages. So, for units digit 4, it appears floor(488/10)=48 times, but since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is less than 4, we don't get an extra 4. Wait, but earlier I had 49. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recalculate. The formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is: floor(n/10) + (1 if the units digit of n is >=d else 0). Wait, no, actually, the number of times digit d appears in units place up to n is: floor((n + 1)/10) if d !=0, else floor(n/10). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's take n=488. For units digit 4: how many numbers between 1 and 488 have units digit 4? It's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. So, 484 is the last one. 484/10=48.4, so 48 full decades, but since 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times. So, the initial count was correct. Similarly, for 8's in units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is included, so 488/10=48.8, so 48 full decades, plus one more for 488, so 49. Correct. So, units place for 4:49, 8:49. Now, tens place: For 4 in tens place: numbers like 40-49,140-149, etc. How many such blocks are there? Up to 488, so 400-488 includes 440-449, which is a full block. So, from 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Correct. For 8 in tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, total 49. Correct. Hundreds place: 4 appears from 400-488:89 times. 8 appears in hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but since we have only up to 488, it's zero. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. Total 8's:49+49+0=98. So, 188-98=90.

But in counting the hundreds place, I'm only looking at the hundreds digit, so that's okay.

Wait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 8's. Since the book is only 488 pages, the hundreds digit can't be 8, so that's correct. I think my counts are accurate. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 numbers here.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The last block has 9 terms, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No pages here, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, 5 sets, first four sets have 10 each, last set has 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct. But let me just think if there's another way to approach this, maybe using a formula or something. Alternatively, for each digit position, we can calculate the number of times a digit appears. For a given digit position (units, tens, hundreds), the count can be calculated based on higher digits and lower digits. But in this case, since the total number is 488, which is less than 500, maybe it's easier to count manually as I did. Alternatively, for the units digit: For each complete set of 10 numbers, each digit 0-9 appears once. So, for 488 pages, the number of complete sets of 10 is 48 (since 48*10=480), and then 8 more numbers (481-488). So, for units digit, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times, and then for the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so digits 1-8 each appear once more. So, total for units digit: 48*1 +1 (for 4) =49. Which matches my earlier count. Similarly, for tens digit: Each complete set of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 488 pages mean 4 complete sets of 100 (400 pages) and 88 pages extra. So, for the tens digit, each digit appears 4*10=40 times. Now, in the extra 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (401-409) to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times do they appear in the extra 88 pages? Let's see: - 401-409: tens digit is 0, 9 numbers (401-409)\n- 410-419: tens digit 1, 10 numbers\n- 420-429: tens digit 2,10\n- 430-439:3,10\n- 440-449:4,10\n- 450-459:5,10\n- 460-469:6,10\n- 470-479:7,10\n- 480-488:8,9 numbers\n\nWait, but 401-409 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 0. So, for tens digit 0, it's 9 times. For digits 1-7, it's 10 each, and for 8, it's 9. So, in the extra 88 pages, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Looking at the tens digits, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total for tens digit 4: 4*10 (from the complete sets) +10 (from the extra) =50. Which matches my earlier count. Similarly, for 8 in the tens place: in the extra 88 pages, 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, total for 8 in tens place: 4*10 (from complete sets) +9=49. Correct. For hundreds digit: For 488 pages, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488. So, that's 89 numbers, as before. For 8 in hundreds place, since 488 is less than 800, there are none. So, 0. So, the counts are accurate. Therefore, the difference is 188 -98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - There are 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - There are 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - There are 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last which contributes 9, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in numbers up to 488.\n   - 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:**\n- 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
