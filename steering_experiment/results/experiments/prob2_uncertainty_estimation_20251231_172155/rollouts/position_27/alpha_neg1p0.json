    "text": " 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. To find how many, divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48, but wait, 488 is included, so it's actually 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. Each step is 10, so from 0 to 488, how many steps? (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9). Let me count each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers. So total eights in tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, subtracting the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, does 488 count? Yes, because the last page is 488. So, how many such numbers? Let's see: the first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each block before that has 10 numbers. Let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counting. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check the units place for eights again. The last number with 8 in units is 488, which is included. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, that's (488 -8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. For tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40 +9=49. Correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds. So, 98 eights. For fours, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Wait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. So, 49+50=99, plus 89=188 fours. So, 188-98=90.

So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Wait, but actually, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's correct. So, total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Wait, let me check that again. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems high. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me think: from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 occurrences of 8 in the units place. Wait, 488 is included, so yes, 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count each set. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers. So, yes, 49 in total for the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my counts. For the 4's: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For the 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.

    "text": " 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but we need to check if 488 is included. 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be next, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. Each block of 100 has 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, for the tens place, we have 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, no, because each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) gives 10 eights, so that's 4*10=40, and then 480-488 gives 9 more, so total 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights are units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Wait, let me check that again. Units: 49, tens: 49, so 49+49=98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in sets of 10 numbers in each hundred:\n     - 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Total occurrences: 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in sets of 10 numbers in each hundred:\n     - 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389.\n   - Additionally, 480-488 contributes 9 more occurrences.\n   - Total occurrences: 4 sets \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in units? Let's see: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. That's correct. Tens place: as I thought, 5 sets of 10, so 50. Hundreds place: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is 488, which is the 49th term because (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my counting for 8's in the tens place. I had 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 full sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. So, 49 eights in tens place. Units place: 49, so total eights:98.

Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. Wait, 8,18,...,488. So, from 0 to 488, that's 49 numbers.

Let's count how many tens places are 8. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, not 10. Wait, no, from 480 to 489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four sets (80-89, etc.) each contribute 10 eights, and the last set (480-488) contributes 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

Let me check again. Wait, units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full tens, so 48 fours, but wait, 488 is the last page, which is 488, so the units digit is 8, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 fours. Tens place: Each hundred has a set of 10 in the tens place, so 40-49, 140-149, etc. From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10.

Again, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included.

So, total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. That adds up to 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. That adds up to 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but let me think again about the tens place for eights. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. That's 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, 49 in tens place. Units place: 49, as 8,18,...,488. So, 49. So, total eights:98.

So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 fours, and there are 5 such sets.\n   - Number of occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:**\n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four sets contribute 10 eights each, and the last set contributes 9.\n   - Number of occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:**\n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

So, the hundreds place has 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, but wait: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me check: 488 is 48*10 + 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let me count how many sets. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last, so 480 to 488 is 9 numbers). So, total eights in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488 is 49 numbers. Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8. Let me check: 8*1=8, 8*2=16, ..., 8*49=392? Wait, no, that's not the right way. Actually, each 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. So, 48 eights. But wait, 488 itself is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 8*1=8, 8*2=16, ..., 8*49=392? Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, no, 8 in units place occurs every 10 numbers. So, the number of 8's in units place is equal to the number of complete decades in 488. So, 488 // 10 = 48, so 48 eights. But wait, 488 is included, so the 48th set is 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, the 8 in units place occurs 48 times, right? Because 8, 18, ..., 488 is 49 numbers, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, I'm confused. Let me think again. Each 10 numbers have one 8 in units place. So, from 1-10: 8 is 1 occurrence. 11-20: 18, so another. So, every 10 numbers, one 8. So, up to 488, how many sets of 10? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. So, 48 eights. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488 is 49 numbers. Wait, that's 49 occurrences. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as (488 + 1) // 10 = 48.9, which would be 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, because 488 is the last number, so the number of 8's in units place is 488 // 10 = 48, but since 488 ends with 8, it's actually 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, no, that's not correct because 488 is the 49th occurrence. Let me check with a smaller number. For example, up to 18: 8 and 18, so two 8's in units place. 18 // 10 = 1, but there are two 8's. So, the formula should be (n + 9) // 10. So, (488 + 9) // 10 = 497 // 10 = 49. So, 49 eights in units place. Okay, so units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-489 would be the next set, but our book ends at 488, so we only have up to 488. Let's count how many sets. Each set of 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 8, contributing 10 eights. So, from 80-89: 10 eights. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. Now, 480-488: how many numbers here? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 in all these, so that's 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, that can't be right because 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 in 9 of them, not 10. So, the total is 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, but earlier I thought units place had 49 eights, tens place had 49, so total 98. But wait, let me check again. Units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 49 eights. So total eights: 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of fours was 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. First, fours: units place had 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct. Eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for eights. Let me recount. Tens place eights: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems right. Units place: 49, as calculated. So, total eights: 98. So, fours are 188, eights are 98, so 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   Total occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).  \n   Each block contributes 10 fours, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).  \n   Total occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   5 \\times 10 = 50\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.  \n   Total occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n   \\]\n\n**Total 4's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 50 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 89 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   Total occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).  \n   Each block contributes 10 eights, except the last block (480-488), which contributes 9.  \n   Total occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   4 \\times 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   Total occurrences: 0\n\n**Total 8's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 49 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 0 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 98\n\\]\n\n**Difference:**  \n\\[\n188 \\, (\\text{fours}) - 98 \\, (\\text{eights}) = 90\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, does 488 count? Yes, because 488 is the last page. So, how many such numbers are there? The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but including 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but wait: 8,18,...,488. Let's see: from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? The formula is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, and 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but we only have up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers). Wait, no: 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 480 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 480 +1 = 9 numbers. So, for the tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total eights in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the fours and eights. For fours: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait a second, when I was counting the tens place for fours, I considered 440-449 as 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. Similarly, for eights, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. Wait, but in the units place for eights, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. Similarly, in the units place for fours, 484 is included, so that's 49 numbers. Wait, but when I calculated units for fours, I thought 484 is the 49th occurrence, but actually, from 4 to 484, how many steps? Let me check: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, that's correct. Similarly, for eights in units place, 8,18,...,488: (488 -8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, that's correct. For the tens place in fours: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. Correct. For eights in tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 49 eights. Correct. Hundreds place for fours: 400-488:89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in hundreds place. Correct. So, 188 fours and 98 eights. So, the difference is 90.

    "text": " 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's printed are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 is the last page. How many 8's in the units place? Starting at 8, then 18, 28,..., 488. So, how many terms? The last term is 488, which is 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488.

Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers, right? Because 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9). So, for each block: 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total eights in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 +9 = 49. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40 plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no hundreds digits of 8 in this book. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n1. **Counting the number of '4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n   - **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n   - **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488).\n   \n   Total '4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of '8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n   - **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n   - **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n   \n   Total '8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but does that include 400-499? No, because the book ends at 488. So, 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, let's add up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count. Each set of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. That's 10*4 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with an 8. So, how many such numbers are there? Let's see: The first is 8, then 18, ..., 488.

Yes, but since the book only goes up to 488, we need to check if 480-488 are included. So, let's count each block.

The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights.

But wait, in the tens place, from 40-49, that's 10, and then each subsequent hundred adds another 10, so up to 400-499, but since the book ends at 488, does that affect the count? Let me think: 40-49: 10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, so 50 fours in the tens place. Okay, that seems correct. Units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the units digit 8 appears 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, that's 49? Let me add again: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, total 8's: 49+49=98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's recount the 4's: units, tens, hundreds. Units: 4,14,24,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds: 400-488:89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. Total 4's:49+50+89=188. Now, 8's: units:8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. (488 -8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds: none, so 0. Total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188 -98=90.

Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many 8's in the units place? The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, let's count each block. 80-89: 10 eights in the tens place. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So total eights in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but wait, our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90.

So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're counting whole numbers, we can think of it as 48 full groups of 10, each contributing an 8 in the units place, plus the last number 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? It's (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 eights in the tens place, except the last block. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (40) plus 9, so 49. Wait, let me check that again. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, etc.) contributes 10 eights, so that's 4*10=40. Then, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (from 480 to 488 inclusive). So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 98. Difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct.

But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 49th occurrence because 4,14,...,484 is 49 numbers. So, units place is 49 fours. So, total fours would be 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, we'll check each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48 eights. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. The first is 8, and the last is 488, which is the 49th term. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), not 10. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block. From 0-400: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, no, for the tens place, it's 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 eights because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks *10 =40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights. Wait, but let me think again. From 80-89: 10 eights. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, but earlier I thought units place had 49 eights and tens place had 49, so total eights would be 98. Let me check again: units place: 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The first term is 8 (n=1), last term is 488 (n=49), so 49 eights. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total eights: 49+49=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me just cross-verify. Wait, earlier I thought the number of fours was 188 and eights 98, so 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure. Let me recount the fours to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last term - first term)/common difference) +1. Here, first term is 4, last term is 484, common difference is 10. So, ((484-4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 fours, so 50 fours in tens place. Hundreds place: 400-488: how many numbers? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours in hundreds place. Total fours: 49+50+89=188. That's correct. Now, eights: units place: 8,18,28,...,488. Number of terms: ((488-8)/10)+1=(480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in units place. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. Hundreds place: 0. Total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours - 98 eights=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 fours, totaling 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488 (9 numbers).\n   - Total: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, let me add them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but wait: 8, 18, ..., 488. Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the number of 8's in the units place is 49, just like the 4's. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, 488 is included. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets do we have? Each full set (like 80-89) gives 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count the full sets: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's four sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Now, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here. So total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. The sets are 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. So total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's. Let me recount the 4's: units place: 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, units place: 49. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each set is 10 numbers, and how many sets? From 40-49 (first set), then 140-149 (second), 240-249 (third), 340-349 (fourth), 440-449 (fifth). So, 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488. How many numbers? 488 - 400 +1=89. So, 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. That's correct. For the 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488. How many terms? (488-8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, units:49. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each full set (80-89, etc.) gives 10 eights, and the last set 480-488 gives 9 eights. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, tens:49. Hundreds:0. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in page numbers 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in page numbers 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Each full range (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 occurrences, and 480-488 contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Final Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit 8 there is included. Let me calculate how many times 8 appears in the units place. The first is 8, then every 10 numbers up to 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of this. So, each of these blocks contributes 10 eights, except maybe the last one if it's cut short. Let's see: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, does 480-488 include 9 numbers? Let me count: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 in 9 of them. So, total eights in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, which is 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49.

Let's calculate how many numbers in each set. Each full set (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, the first four sets contribute 10 each, and the last set contributes 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Wait, units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. That's correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, so 5\u00d710=50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49 +50 +89=188. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many. The first is 8, last is 488. So, (488 -8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers, not 10. So, let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. So, number of fours is 188, number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Did I count correctly? For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that's the calculation. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, in the tens place for eights, I had 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). That's 5 sets, but the last one is only 9. So, 10\u00d74=40, plus 9=49. So that's correct. For fours, in the hundreds place, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours. Units place: 49 fours, tens place:50 fours. So, total 188 fours. Eights: units 49, tens 49. So, 98 eights. Difference:90. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Now, I need to check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, total fours in the tens place are 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place will have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but wait, when I count the hundreds place, I'm including numbers like 400-488, which are three-digit numbers. But when I counted the tens place, I included 40-49, which are two-digit and three-digit? Wait, no, 40-49 are two-digit numbers, so their tens place is 4, but their hundreds place is 0. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears only from 400-488, which is 89 times. So, total fours are 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many such numbers. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count how many sets. Each hundred has a set of 10 where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, total eights in the tens place are 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours are 188, total eights are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.

So, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but let's check if 488 is included. 488 is 48*10 + 8, so yes, it's the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me check if 480-489 is included, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place contributes 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that can't be right because 188 - 98 is 90, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the fours and eights. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but when I was counting the tens place for eights, I thought that 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. So, that's correct. Similarly, for fours in the tens place, it's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50.

Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in units? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full sets, but since 488 is the last page, the 48th set ends at 480, and then 484 is the next occurrence, which is the 49th.

From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40 plus 9=49.

Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours in total. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. So, from 4 to 484, how many numbers? The formula is ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49.

So, how many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49.

Let's count how many full sets we have. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. So, the first four sets give 10 each, and the last set gives 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. For 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Correct. So, total eights:49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. Difference:188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last number is 488, so how many are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because it's the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 8. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 count? But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, how many sets do we have? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480 is the first, then 481, ..., up to 488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) = 98 eights. Wait, that's 49+49=98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) -98 (number of 8's)=90.

Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, how many terms? Let's calculate: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but 480-488 is within our range. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 eights in the tens place. So, how many such blocks do we have? From 1-100: 80-89 (10 eights), 101-200: 180-189 (10), 201-300: 280-289 (10), 301-400: 380-389 (10), and 401-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, because 488 is the last page. So, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 numbers. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (from 1-400) and then 9 from 480-488. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.
