    "text": " 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. From 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. That's correct. Tens place: Each hundred block has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, and there are 5 hundred blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, actually, 400-488 is part of the 400-499 block, but we only go up to 488. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50 fours. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with 8. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488: the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 numbers (480-488), right? Because 480 has 8 in the tens place, 481, etc., up to 488. So, let's count how many sets. Each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Then, in the 400-488 block, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. This is 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. This is 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as there are no pages 800-899.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, which would give 48 numbers, but since 484 is the last one, that's 49 numbers. So units place: 49 fours. Tens place: each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 4, so from 1-400, that's 4 sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10. So total tens place fours: 40 +10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 1-400: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's 4 sets, each with 10, so 40 eights. Then, from 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, 480 is the start, then 481, 482,...,488. That's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, how many eights? 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, so 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, no. Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, which is 49. So total tens place eights: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98 eights. So, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers, contributing 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with 8. So, how many such numbers are there? Let's see: the first is 8, then every 10 numbers. The last one is 488. So, to find how many, we can do (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is included. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the tens place for eights again. When I counted the tens place, I considered 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. That's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49. That seems correct. Similarly, for fours in the tens place, I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50. So, 50 fours in the tens place, and 49 eights in the tens place. So, the difference is 1 in the tens place, but overall, the fours are more by 90. Wait, but let me check the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct. So, adding up, 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188 fours. Eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98 eights. So, 188-98=90.

So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, let me check: 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, the book ends at 488, so 480-489 would be the next set, but 488 is the last page. So, 480-488: the tens digit is 8 here. How many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but in the tens place, each block of 100 has 10 numbers with tens digit 8, except possibly the last block if it's cut short. Let's count each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289:10. - 380-389:10. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. Difference is 90. Hmm, but wait, in the tens place for 8's, I counted 49, but let me confirm: each hundred block contributes 10, except the last one which is 9. So, 4 blocks of 10 and one of 9: 4*10 + 9 = 49. That seems right. Similarly, for 4's in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Units place for 4: 49, which is correct because 484 is the last one. Tens place for 4: 50, which is correct because 440-449 is 10 numbers, and we have 5 such blocks. So, I think my counts are accurate.

    "text": " Hmm, but wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, 449 is less than 488, so it's okay. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in the numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, we're only interested in how many times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. Each number from 400-488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours printed: 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, does 488 count? Yes, because the units digit is 8. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so we take 49 numbers, right? Because from 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, for the tens digit being 8, the numbers are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480-488). Let me count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, total eights in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights printed: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract 98 from 188: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check my calculations again, because I think I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me start over, maybe I overcounted somewhere. First, for the fours: units place: from 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So that's correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each 10 numbers, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, for the eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. Let's see, 488 is included, so how many terms? (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. Total eights: 49 +49 +0=98. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90 more fours. Hmm, but wait, I feel like 90 seems a bit high. Let me think again. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. That seems correct. For eights, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds: total 98 eights. So, 188 -98=90. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it differently. Let me try another approach. For each digit position, count the number of 4's and 8's separately. Let's start with units digit: For units digit, 4's appear every 10 numbers, so total number is floor((488)/10) +1 if 488 mod 10 >=4. 488/10=48.8, so floor is 48, but since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is greater than 4, we add 1, so 49. Similarly, for 8's, units digit: floor(488/10)=48, and since 488 mod10=8, which is equal to 8, so 48+1=49. So, units digit: 49 fours, 49 eights. Now, tens digit: For tens digit being 4, we look at each hundred block. In each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. How many complete hundreds are there? 488 is in the 400-488 range, so up to 400-488. So, how many times does the tens digit 4 occur? From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours in the tens place. For 8's in the tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 5 sets, each 10 except the last which is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Now, hundreds digit: For fours, 400-488: 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. For eights, since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with hundreds digit 8, so 0 eights there. Now, adding up: Fours: units(49) + tens(50) + hundreds(89) = 49+50=99+89=188. Eights: units(49) + tens(49) + hundreds(0)=98. So, 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights. Hmm, that seems consistent. I think I did it correctly. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, except the last which has 9 (480-488).\n   - Total occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is before 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48, but let's check the last number: 488 is included, so how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Starting at 8, each 10 numbers adds one. The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is the 49th number where the units digit is 8. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, except possibly the last one. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) -98 (eights)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " But wait, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is okay, but does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, 449 is less than 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, 99 + 89 is 188? Wait, 99 + 80 is 179, plus 9 is 188. Yes, that's correct. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. How many such numbers? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the 49th number because starting from 8, each 10 numbers add one. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many sets we have. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4\u00d710 =40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's recount the fours: Units place: 49, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. Now, eights: Units place:49, Tens place:49, Hundreds place:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me make sure I didn't count any numbers beyond 488. For example, in the tens place for fours, I had 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. Similarly, for eights, the tens place goes up to 488, so 480-488 is correct. Also, in the units place, 488 is included, so that's correct. I think my calculations are accurate. So, the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.  \n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in numbers 400-488.  \n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   - The last block has 9 occurrences (480-488).  \n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's, checking each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but including 488, that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488.

So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights are 98.

    "text": " 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in units? It's 48 times for each hundred, right? Wait, no. Let me think differently. For every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles 0-9. So, in 1-100, there are 10 fours in the units place (4,14,...,94). Similarly, in 101-200, another 10, and so on up to 400-488. Wait, 488 is less than 500, so up to 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, how many full hundreds are there? From 1-400, that's four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these has 10 fours in the units place, so 4 * 10 = 40 fours. Then, from 401-488, the units digit 4 appears how many times? Let's see: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers. So total units fours: 40 + 9 = 49. Okay, that matches my initial count. So units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total fours:49+50+89=188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 /10 =48.8, so 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of it. So, each of these blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last, so 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so 9 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place, so 9 eights. So total tens eights: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that's 49+49=98. So, total fours are 188, eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more fours than eights. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the fours and eights again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, plus 89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for fours. In the tens place, I had 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That seems correct. For eights in tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. The first four blocks are 10 each, so 4*10=40, and 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 40+9=49. That seems correct. Units place for fours: from 1-488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in units, so 488/10=48.8, so 49 fours, but wait, does 488 have a 4 in units? No, 488 has 8 in units. So, the last 4 in units is 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units fours:49. Similarly, units eights: from 8,18,...,488. 488 is included, so that's 49 eights. So, that seems correct. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but I feel like 90 might be too high. Let me check with a smaller example to see if my method is correct. Suppose we have a 20-page book. Let's count the number of 4's and 8's. Page numbers:1-20. Fours:4,14 => 2 fours. Eights:8,18 =>2 eights. So, difference is 0. Using my method: units place: fours: 2 (4,14), eights:2 (8,18). Tens place: fours: none, eights: none. Hundreds place: none. So, total fours:2, eights:2. Difference:0. Correct. Another example: 40-page book. Fours:4,14,24,34,40-49, but wait, up to 40. So, fours:4,14,24,34,40. So, units:4,14,24,34 =>4 fours. Tens:40-49, but only up to 40, so 40 has a 4 in tens. So, tens:1 four. So total fours:5. Eights:8,18,28,38,48. But up to 40, so 8,18,28,38 =>4 eights. So, difference:5-4=1. Using my method: units fours:4 (4,14,24,34). Tens fours:40-49: but up to 40, so only 40, which is 1. So, total fours:5. Eights: units:8,18,28,38 =>4. Tens: none, since 40-49 is beyond 40. So, total eights:4. Difference:1. Correct. So, my method seems to work. Therefore, for 488 pages, the difference is 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).

    "text": " But wait, let me make sure. The first set is 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, and so on up to 440-449. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers from 400-488. Wait, no, the hundreds digit is 4 in 400-499, but since the book ends at 488, it's 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, 488-400=88, but adding 1 gives 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Let's count each set: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, because 488-480+1=9). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10=40 and 9, so total 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   - From 0 to 484, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place.  \n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 fours in the tens place.  \n   - Total: 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in 400-488.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   - From 400 to 488, inclusive, there are 89 numbers.  \n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   - From 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place.  \n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place.  \n   - 480-488 contributes 9 eights.  \n   - Total: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " But wait, 440-449 is the fifth set, right? So 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many terms? The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. That's correct. Tens place: Each hundred block contributes 10. From 1-400, that's 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10, so 4\u00d710=40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total tens place fours: 40 +10=50. That's correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89. So total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many numbers. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the formula: (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488. Let's count how many sets: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 -480 +1=9). So total tens place eights: 4\u00d710 +9=49. Wait, that's 40 +9=49. So 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. So total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake. For units place fours: 4,14,...,484. That's 49. For tens place fours: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). So that's 5 sets \u00d710=50. Hundreds place fours: 400-488 is 89 numbers. So 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. That's 49. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So 49+49=98. So 188-98=90.

Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. So, total in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

So, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place for fours, I considered 440-449 as the fifth set, which is correct because 400-499 would be the hundreds place, but since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds place is up to 488, but for the tens place, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. Similarly, for eights in the tens place, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 49 total. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the difference is 90. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     5 \\text{ blocks} \\times 10 = 50\n     \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n     \\]\n\n**Total 4's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 50 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 89 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     4 \\text{ full blocks} \\times 10 + 9 = 49\n     \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     0\n     \\]\n\n**Total 8's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 49 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 0 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 98\n\\]\n\n**Difference:**  \n\\[\n188 \\, (\\text{fours}) - 98 \\, (\\text{eights}) = 90\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

But we're only concerned with the digit 4 in the hundreds place. Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but the book only goes up to 488, so from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours printed. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many full sets there are. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 full sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights printed. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 sets, 10 each, so 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is 488, so 8 is the units digit. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers with 8 in units place? Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is within the book's page limit of 488. Let me count how many sets of 100 have 8 in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers (e.g., 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 10 (from 80-89) + 10 (180-189) +10 (280-289)+10 (380-389)+9 (480-488) = 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that's 90 more fours. But let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the fours. Units place: 4,14,...,484. That's 484/10 =48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49 (10),140-149(10),240-249(10),340-349(10),440-449(10). That's 5 sets, 10 each, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Total fours: 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. Now, eights: Units place:8,18,...,488: 49 numbers. Tens place:80-89(10),180-189(10),280-289(10),380-389(10),480-488(9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Hundreds place:0. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Therefore, total number of eights is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's are printed, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   Total occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\text{ full sets} + 1 \\text{ (for 484)} = 49\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.  \n   Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling:  \n   \\[\n   5 \\times 10 = 50\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488.  \n   Total occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n   \\]\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 50 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 89 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   Total occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\text{ full sets} + 1 \\text{ (for 488)} = 49\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.  \n   The first four ranges each contribute 10 occurrences, and the last range contributes 9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers).  \n   Total occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.  \n   Total occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   0\n   \\]\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 49 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 0 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 98\n\\]\n\n**Difference between the number of 4's and 8's:**  \n\\[\n188 \\, (\\text{4's}) - 98 \\, (\\text{8's}) = 90\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\[\n\\boxed{90}\n\\]"

Now, adding up the fours in each place: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are.

Now, 480-489 would be the next set, but since the book ends at 488, we only go up to 488.

So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similarly, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see: the last number is 488, so the units digit 8 occurs at 488. How many times? The first is 8, the next is 18, and so on.

So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last set. So, how many tens places with 8? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but wait: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for each of these 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, but wait a second, let me double-check the tens place for 8's. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, correct. 180-189:10, correct. 280-289:10, correct. 380-389:10, correct. 480-488: that's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9=49, which is correct. So, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This sequence has 49 terms (from 0 to 484, inclusive).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 fours.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - There are 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This sequence has 49 terms (from 0 to 488, inclusive).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - There are 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 40 numbers.\n   - The last block is 480-488, contributing 9 numbers.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (as the book ends at 488).\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " But wait, does 440-449 actually have 10 numbers? Yes, because 440 is included, and 449 is the last one, so that's 10 numbers. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up the fours in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's printed are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers add one. Let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count each block. - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights in tens place. - 180-189: 10 eights. - 280-289: 10 eights. - 380-389: 10 eights. - 480-488: Now, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so the tens digit is 8 in all these 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights. Wait, that adds up to 49, but let me check: 4 sets of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) give 40, and then 480-488 gives 9 more, so total 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights in each place: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49 = 98. So, total 8's printed are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds place has 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? It's (488 + 1) / 10, but since 488 is not a multiple of 10, it's floor(488/10) + 1 if 488 >= 4. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor(48.8) is 48, but since 484 is included, it's 49 numbers. So units: 49. Tens place: Each hundred has 10, and there are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so does that affect the tens place? Wait, no, because in the tens place, it's about the second digit, not the hundreds. So, 40-49: 10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. So that's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. So that's correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor(48.8) is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, how many? Let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, numbers where the tens digit is 8. These are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. So each hundred block contributes 10 numbers, except the last one. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, which is 4*10 +9=49. So tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights =90. Wait, but let me double-check the counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

    "text": " But wait, does 488 go beyond 449? No, because 440-449 is up to 449, and then 450-488 is next. So, the tens digit is 4 only up to 449, so 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours printed: 188.

So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but does 480-488 have 9 numbers? Let me check: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers, yes. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights printed: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that's 90. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Wait, no. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book ends at 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Wait, but wait, that's correct because each of those 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right because 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check because 488 is the last page, so in the hundreds place, it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. Now, moving on to the 8's. Let's do the same for 8's: units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is included, so from 8 to 488, how many numbers? It's the same as the number of fours in the units place, which was 49. Wait, but let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. So, the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 eights in the tens place, and the last set (480-488) has 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but wait, let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recount the fours: units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is 488, which is the 49th number because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets do we have? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's in the tens place, I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50. For the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so that's correct. Units place for 4's: from 4, 14,...484. Since 484 is 484, which is 484/10 = 48.4, so 49 times. So 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. For 8's: units place 49, tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 10*4 +9=49. So total 49+49=98. So 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 484 \u00f7 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 100: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 \u00f7 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 100: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block which has 9 (480-488).\n   - Total occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, let me add up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but including 488, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488. Let's count each block. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

    "text": " 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: from 4, 14, 24,...,484. How many terms? The nth term is 10n - 6. Wait, maybe a better way is to calculate how many times 4 appears in each position. For units place: For every 10 numbers, there's one 4. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, which means 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48 fours, but we also have the 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 fours in units place. For tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 400-488 is 89 numbers, but in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see, 40-49: 10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50 fours in tens place. For hundreds place: From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in hundreds place. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many. The first is 8, last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. So, 49 eights in units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's calculate how many times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\nEach full hundred has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 =49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights here.\n\nAdding up all the eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 =98 eights.\n\nWait, let me double-check the tens place for 8's. The sets are:\n\n- 80-89:10 numbers\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9.\n\nSo, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct.\n\nSo, total eights:49+49=98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the hundreds place had 0, so total eights are 98.\n\nNow, the number of fours is 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting fours. Let me recount:\n\nUnits place: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, (484 -4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49 fours.\n\nTens place: 40-49:10,140-149:10,240-249:10,340-349:10,440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488:89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nEights: Units place:8,18,...,488:49 eights.\n\nTens place:80-89:10,180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. Total 49.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"how many more 4's are printed than 8's.\" So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I counted correctly. Sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in the range.\n\nWait, for the units place of 4's: 4,14,...,484. The last term is 484, which is 4 + 10*(n-1)=484. So, 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. Correct.\n\nFor the tens place of 4's: 40-49,140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, and there are 5 such sets (40-49 is in the first hundred, 140-149 in the second, etc., up to 440-449 in the fourth hundred? Wait, 440-449 is in the 400-499 range, which is the fifth hundred? Wait, no. Let me see: 40-49 is in 1-100, 140-149 in 101-200, 240-249 in 201-300, 340-349 in 301-400, and 440-449 in 401-500. But since the book ends at 488, 440-449 is within the range. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Correct.\n\nFor hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct.\n\nFor eights: Units place:8,18,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 8 +10*(n-1)=488. So, 10*(n-1)=480, n-1=48, n=49. Correct.\n\nTens place:80-89:10,180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, total fours:188, eights:98, difference:90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because 488 is included in both the units and tens place counts. Let me check if 488 was counted correctly.\n\nIn units place for 4's: 484 is the last one, so 488 isn't a 4 in units place. Correct.\n\nIn units place for 8's: 488 is included, so that's correct.\n\nIn tens place for 8's: 480-488 includes 488, so that's 9 numbers:480,481,...,488. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my counts are accurate.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so 188 -98=90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Each full set (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 occurrences, with the last set (480-488) contributing 9.\n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = **49**.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers in the book reach 800, so 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

So, the hundreds place has 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. To find how many, divide 488 by 10, which gives 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's actually 49 occurrences. Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th number in the units place. Let me check: from 8 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 +1 = 9). So, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (including both ends). Let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   - 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   - This sequence has 49 terms (from 4 to 484, stepping by 10).  \n   - **Total 4's in units place:** 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).  \n   - **Total 4's in tens place:** 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 4 appears in numbers from 400 to 488.  \n   - This range includes 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1).  \n   - **Total 4's in hundreds place:** 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   - 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   - This sequence has 49 terms (from 8 to 488, stepping by 10).  \n   - **Total 8's in units place:** 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.  \n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.  \n   - **Total 8's in tens place:** 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - **Total 8's in hundreds place:** 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but does 440-449 count as 10 numbers? Yes, because 440 to 449 is 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place. So, 5 sets \u00d710 =50. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 =89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours printed: 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: starting at 8, each 10 numbers add one 8. So, from 8 to 488, how many? The formula is floor((488 - 8)/10) +1. So, (488-8)=480, 480/10=48, so 48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers, since 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9). So, each block except the last one has 10 numbers. Let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights printed:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) =90.

    "text": " Wait, but wait, from 40-49 is the first set, then each subsequent hundred adds another 10. So, 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number is 488, so the units digit 8 occurs at 488. To find how many times, I can divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but wait, 48*10=480, so the next number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is included, so from 8, 18,...,488, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many numbers in each set: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So that's 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) -98 (number of 8's)=90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then every 10 numbers. So, 4,14,24,...,484. The last one is 484, which is 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. That's correct. In the tens place, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, and there are 5 hundreds (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). Wait, but in 400-488, the tens digit can be 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50. That's correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units place, same as 4's, 49. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as the book ends at 488.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " But wait, 440-449 is the fifth set, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so it's okay. So, 5 sets \u00d710 =50. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 =89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but including 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers:480,481,...,488). Wait, that's not correct. Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 eights. So total in tens place: 4\u00d710 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=49+49=98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's), which equals 90.

So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which would suggest 49 numbers (since 8, 18, ..., 488). So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 fall within the book? The book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, how many sets of 10 numbers have 8 in the tens place?

So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me confirm: 400-488 is 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188.

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's see: Each block from 80-89, 180-189, etc., gives 10 numbers. There are 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 eights in the tens place. That's 4*10=40. Now, the last block is 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here. So total in tens place: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the question is how many more fours than eights. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99+89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 89.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each full block contributes 10 occurrences (4 blocks), and the last block contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many there are. The last occurrence is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let me count each block. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - The last block is 480-488, contributing 9 occurrences.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
