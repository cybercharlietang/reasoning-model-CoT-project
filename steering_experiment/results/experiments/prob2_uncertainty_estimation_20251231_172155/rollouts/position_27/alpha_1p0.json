    "text": " Hmm, wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is at 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers add one. So, 8, 18, ..., 488: that's 49 times. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many sets we have. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, is that right? Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4 + 9 = 40 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but let me double-check. From 1-99: 40-49: 10 fours. Then 100-199: 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249: 10. 300-399: 340-349: 10. 400-488: 440-449: 10. So that's 5 times 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 4,14,...,484. So, how many? The formula is floor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10) = 48. But wait, when I count from 4 to 484, that's 484 - 4 / 10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So units place is 49 fours. Tens place: as above, 50 fours. Hundreds place: 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many terms? (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but since the book only goes up to 488, we only have 480-488. So, let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me confirm: from 1-99: 80-89:10. 100-199:180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that's 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.

    "text": " Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks times 10 gives 50. Hmm, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's okay. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me confirm: 400 has hundreds digit 4, 401, 402,... up to 488. Yes, that's 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours from each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that happens. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, the number of 8's in units place is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, that's 49 times. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights from each place: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's. Wait, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

That's 5 blocks, so 5\u00d710=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me confirm: 400-488 inclusive is 89 numbers because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers.

Yes, because the book has 488 pages. So, how many 8's in the units place? Let's see: The first occurrence is 8, then every 10 numbers. The last occurrence is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms? The sequence is 8, 18, ..., 488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. Let me set 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. Solving: (n-1)*10 = 480 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's break it down: - 80-89: 10 numbers, each has an 8 in the tens place. So, 10 eights. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: Now, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, each of these has an 8. So, 9 eights here. So total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights. Wait, let me check again: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10\u00d74=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

That's 5 sets, so 5\u00d710=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many?

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many full sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, except maybe the last one.

So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Therefore, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. The difference is 188-98=90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0, total 98. Difference is 90. Hmm, but wait, did I count correctly in the tens place for fours? Let me check again. For fours in tens place:40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10.

So, total fours:188, eights:98, difference 90. Wait, but let me check if I included all the numbers correctly. For units place fours: from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers, so 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The sequence is 4 +10(n-1)=484. So, 10(n-1)=480, n-1=48, n=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Correct. For units place eights:8,18,...,488. Similarly, 8+10(n-1)=488. 10(n-1)=480, n-1=48, n=49. So, 49 eights in units place. Correct. For tens place fours:5 sets of 10, so 50. Correct. For tens place eights:4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, so 49. Correct. Hundreds place fours: from 400-488: 89 numbers, each with a 4 in hundreds place. Correct. Hundreds place eights: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488. So, yes, 188 fours and 98 eights, difference of 90.

So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does that mean 49 eights in the units place? Let me check: starting at 8, every 10 numbers, so 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is included, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so only up to 488. Let me count how many sets of 100 have the tens digit as 8. Each set (like 80-89) has 10 numbers. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. But wait, 480-489 would be the next, but since the book ends at 488, how many numbers in 480-488 have 8 in the tens place? 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them because 480 has 8 in the tens place, 481, etc., up to 488. So, that's 9 numbers. So, total in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and then 9 more from 480-488. So, that's 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me double-check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. That seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10th number, resulting in 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

This totals 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but let me confirm: 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10. That's 5 sets, so 5\u00d710=50. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but let me check: 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, the count is 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. I'll go through each digit position again. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, (488-8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, wait, no. 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) contribute 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9. So total in tens place: 4\u00d710 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, let me check the tens place for 8's again. When I was counting the tens place for 8's, I considered 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks gives 10 eights in the tens place, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So total is 40+9=49. That seems correct. Similarly, for 4's in the tens place, I had 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10, so 5\u00d710=50. That's correct. And for the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, yes, 188 fours. And 98 eights. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be different. Let me try another approach to confirm. Alternatively, I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position separately, and maybe I missed something. Let me recount the units place for 4's. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is floor(488/10)=48 full decades, each contributing a 4 in the units place. But wait, 48\u00d710=480, so 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 fours in the units place. Correct. For 8's in the units place: similarly, 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is floor(488/10)=48 full decades, but since 488 is included, it's 49 terms. So, 49 eights in the units place. Correct. Now, for the tens place, 4's: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 5\u00d710=50. Correct. For 8's in the tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, the first four blocks are 10 each, and the last block is 9. So, 4\u00d710 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 4's are in 400-488, which is 89 numbers. 8's in hundreds place: none, since the book ends at 488. So, 0. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. Total 8's:49+49+0=98. Difference:188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, and hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** None (since the book ends at 488) \u2192 0 occurrences.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but let me check the upper limit. 449 is less than 488, so yes, that's okay. So, 5 sets \u00d710 =50. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so does it count? Yes, because the units digit is 8. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, the number of terms is ((488 -8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book stops at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 eights in the tens place, so that's 4\u00d710=40. The last set, 480-488, has 9 eights in the tens place. So total tens place eights: 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours -98 eights =90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total:188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total:98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. For the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of those is 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. Correct. Units place: from 4,14,...484: which is 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Correct. For eights: units place, 8,18,...488: 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10,180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. So 4\u00d710 +9=49. Correct. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " Wait, but let me check: from 40-49 is 10, then 140-149 is another 10, so 20, then 240-249: 30, 340-349:40, 440-449:50. So yes, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these numbers has a 4, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. So total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but including 488, that's 49 occurrences. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's break it down: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights. - 180-189: another 10, so total 20. - 280-289: another 10, total 30. - 380-389: another 10, total 40. - 480-488: Now, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, each of these has an 8, so that's 9 eights. So total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, how many steps of 10? (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block is 10, and there are 5 blocks, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in hundreds place. So 89. Total fours:49+50+89=188. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89:10,180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, since 800+ is beyond 488. So total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = \\frac{480}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).  \n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     5 \\times 10 = 50\n     \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488.  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n     \\]\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 50 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 89 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = \\frac{480}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).  \n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block (480-488), which contributes 9.  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     4 \\times 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49\n     \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.  \n   - Number of occurrences: 0\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 49 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 0 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 98\n\\]\n\n**Difference between the number of 4's and 8's:**  \n\\[\n188 \\, (\\text{fours}) - 98 \\, (\\text{eights}) = 90\n\\]\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours.

The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but including 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480-488). So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except maybe the last block. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that seems off because I thought 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 480-488: 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. But wait, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all those numbers, right? So, that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, adding up, units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0, total 98 eights. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.

Wait, from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the tens place, we have 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights.

I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that happens. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. How many numbers is that? Let me calculate: (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the tens digit being 8, right? So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except possibly the last block. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. Then 480-488: how many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit is 8 in 9 numbers here. So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, let me check that again. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, so that's 4*10=40. Then, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but how many numbers? 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so that's 9. So, total in tens place is 40+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, there are 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of eights is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10 occurrences.\n   - Total: 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block (480-488) contributing 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but let me confirm. From 1-488, how many hundreds do we have? 488 is less than 500, so we have 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers each, and in the last hundred (400-488), it's 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the 49th number because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. Wait, no, 8,18,...,488. Let me check: 8 is the first, then every 10. So, how many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488. So, (n-1)*10 \u2264 480, so n-1 \u226448, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last, so 480-488 is 9 numbers). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 numbers instead of 10. So, total for tens place: 4 blocks with 10 each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one block with 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's:188, total 8's:98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 5 sets times 10 is 50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the fours from each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 numbers (since 488 is included). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for each hundred block, except the last one, we have 10 numbers. Let's see: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in the tens or hundreds place. For fours: units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0, total 98. 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " Wait, let me double-check. From 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 fours in the tens place. Similarly, each subsequent hundred has another 10, so 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449: that's 5 times, so 5\u00d710=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, let me add that again: 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. To find how many, divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. So, taking the integer part, that's 48, but since 488 is included, that's actually 49 numbers. Wait, 8,18,...,488. Let's check: from 0 to 488, how many multiples of 10 have 8 in the units place. 488 \u00f710=48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then the 488 itself is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except possibly the last one. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 times 10 and once 9, so 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me make sure. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Wait, 49+49 is 98. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. Now, how many more 4's than 8's? 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers. Wait, let me just cross-verify to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units place 49, tens place 50, hundreds place 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

    "text": " Wait, no, each block is 100 numbers, so from 1-400, there are four blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, the tens place can be 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So total is 40 +10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 401-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 50 in total. Hmm, maybe I overcounted earlier. Let me think again. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total fours in tens place: 40+10=50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Wait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first number where the hundreds digit is 4, and 488 is the last. So, the count is 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. From 1-400: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) would have 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 40 +9=49 eights. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me verify the tens place for fours again. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so total 50. That's correct. For eights in tens place, from 1-400, 4*10=40, and from 401-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 40+9=49. That's correct. Units place for both fours and eights is 49 each, which makes sense because 488 is included, so the last occurrence is at 488. So, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the number of fours printed is 90 more than the number of eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires comparing the number of times the digit '4' appears to the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Count the number of '4's:**\n   - **Units place:** '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** '4' appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block of 100 contributes 10, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** '4' appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Count the number of '8's:**\n   - **Units place:** '8' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** '8' appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block of 100 contributes 10, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No '8's since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's - Number of '8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of '4's printed exceeds the number of '8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Wait, no, each block is 100 numbers, and in each block, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So that's 4*10=40 fours. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So total tens place fours would be 40 +10=50. Wait, that's 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 eights in the tens place. That's 4*10=40 eights. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. Therefore, total tens place eights: 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract 98 from 188: 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 5 sets would be 5*10=50. Hmm, that seems correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, it does. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, let's count each block: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Let me check again. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 -400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct. For the tens place of fours, I had 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Units place: 49 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights, units place: 49, tens place: 49, so 98. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " Wait, no, because each block is 100 numbers, and each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, how many blocks are there? Let me think: the page numbers go up to 488, so the hundreds digits go from 0 (for 1-99) to 4 (for 400-488). So, the hundreds digits are 0,1,2,3,4. Each of these hundreds digits will have a tens digit of 4 in 10 numbers per hundred. So, 0-99: 40-49: 10 fours. 100-199:140-149:10. 200-299:240-249:10. 300-399:340-349:10. 400-488:440-449:10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. The hundreds digit is 4 only in 400-499, but since the book ends at 488, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. How many terms? Let's calculate (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except possibly the last block if it doesn't go up to 489. Let's see: 0-99:80-89:10 eights. 100-199:180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488: how many? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, 480-488 has 9 eights, not 10. So, the first four blocks (0-399) each contribute 10 eights, and the last block (400-488) contributes 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. Wait, but let me check: 0-99:10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I feel like that might be correct, but let me check the tens place for fours again. When I counted the tens place for fours, I considered each hundred block contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 0-99:40-49:10 fours. 100-199:140-149:10. 200-299:240-249:10. 300-399:340-349:10. 400-488:440-449:10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50. That's correct. Now, for the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. Units place: 4,14,...,484. Let me check how many terms that is. The sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The nth term is 10n -6. Wait, no, the nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 4 +10(n-1)=10n -6. We want 10n -6 \u2264488. So, 10n \u2264494, so n \u226449.4, so n=49. So, 49 terms. So, units place:49 fours. So, that adds up to 49+50+89=188. For eights, units place:8,18,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 8 + (n-1)*10=488. So, 10(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in units place. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9 eights. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours and 98 eights. The difference is 188-98=90.

So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.

Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, let's count each block. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. And 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the tens place for fours again. I had 440-449 as the last set, which is correct because 488 is beyond 449, so 440-449 is 10 numbers, making it 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Yes, that's right. For eights in the tens place, I had 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. Units place for both fours and eights is 49 each, because from 1 to 488, the last 8 in units is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, yes, units place for both is 49. So, the difference is 90.

Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 +50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similarly, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is included, so from 8 to 488, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers (since 488-480+1=9). Wait, is that correct? Wait, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, that's 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights. Wait, but let me think again: Each hundred block (like 1-100) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block (400-488), which only has 9. So, 4 blocks of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and then 9 in 480-488. So, 4\u00d710 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98 eights. Wait, but wait, let me check the tens place again. When I was counting the eights in the tens place, I had 49, but I think I might have made a mistake. Let me recount: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. Now, the fours were 188, and the eights were 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.  \n   Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks.  \n   Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.  \n   Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.  \n   The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.  \n   Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 times 10 is 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, total fours in hundreds place: 89. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is the range. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, that's 9 numbers, not 10. So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one block of 9 (480-488). So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   Total occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).  \n   Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).  \n   Total occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   5 \\times 10 = 50\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.  \n   Total occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n   \\]\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\[\n49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   Total occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).  \n   The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.  \n   Total occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   Total occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   0\n   \\]\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\[\n49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\\]\n\n**Difference:**  \n\\[\n188 - 98 = 90\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but let me check. The page numbers go up to 488, so the last block is 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 5*10=50. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but wait, the hundreds place can only be 4 in the range 400-499, but since the book ends at 488, it's 400-488. So, yes, 89 numbers. So, hundreds place has 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is included? Let me check: 488 is the last page, so yes. So, the first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. How many such numbers? The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms can be calculated as follows: The first term is 8, the last term is 488, and the common difference is 10. The formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d. So, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10. Let's solve for n: 488 - 8 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 480 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n=49. So, there are 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is the last set. Let's see how many full sets there are. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, so the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 eights in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40. Then, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but wait, let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This sequence has 49 terms (from 4 to 484, step 10).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 fours, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - This range includes 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This sequence has 49 terms (from 8 to 488, step 10).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 eights each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Wait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first, 401, 402,... up to 488. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.

Wait, 488 ends with an 8, so that's the last occurrence. So, how many such numbers? Let's see: The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. How many terms? Let me calculate: The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, let's count each block. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total is 10*4 +9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8.

    "text": " Wait, but let me check. From 40-49: 10, then 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. That's 5 times 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but wait a second: the hundreds place is 4 only in 400-499, but since the book ends at 488, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems high. Let me double-check. Wait, when I counted the units place, I thought it was 49, but maybe that's incorrect. Let me recount the units place. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first occurrence is at 4, then 14, 24, ..., up to 484. The last number is 484, which is 484 - 4 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, so 49 numbers (including both 4 and 484). So, units place: 49 fours. Tens place: as before, 50 fours. Hundreds place: 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many times? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Each full set (80-89, etc.) has 10 eights in the tens place, so let's see how many full sets there are. From 0-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 5 sets, but the last set is only 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no: 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place: the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights, and the last set (480-488) contributes 9 eights. So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check if I made a mistake somewhere. Wait, when counting the hundreds place for fours, I had 89 fours because from 400-488, that's 89 numbers. But wait, 400-488 inclusive is 89 numbers, correct. But let me think again: 400 is the first, 401, ..., 488. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So that's correct. For the eights, in the tens place, I had 49. Wait, but let me recount the tens place for eights. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges contributes 10 eights, so 4*10=40. The last range, 480-488, is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 9 eights. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct. Units place: 49 eights. So total eights: 49 + 49 = 98. Fours: 188. Difference: 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers (from 4 to 484, inclusive).\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.

There are 49 such numbers.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9, totaling 49 instances.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Hmm, wait, but wait. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many hundreds do we have? Let's see: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, in each of these, the tens digit is 4 in the blocks 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, the first block is 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. Then 240-249: 10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but let me confirm: 400 is included, so from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full groups of 10, but 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but let me check: 8,18,...,488. How many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264488. So, 8 +10(n-1) \u2264488 \u2192 10(n-1) \u2264480 \u2192 n-1 \u226448 \u2192 n \u226449. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Wait, but wait, the last number in the tens place being 449 is still within 488, so that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in each of these, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Wait, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, but the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with an 8. So, how many such numbers are there? The first is 8, then every 10 numbers. So, from 8 to 488, how many terms? Let's see: The first term is 8 (which is 8*1), and the last term is 488, which is 8*61 = 488. Wait, 8*61 is 488, right? So, the number of terms is 61. Wait, but let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So, how many terms? The formula is ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Wait, 8*61 is 488, so 61 terms? Wait, but 8*1=8, 8*2=16, but 16 is not in the units place as 8. Wait, no, I'm making a mistake. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so the number of times 8 appears in the units place up to 488 is the same as the number of times 8 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. So, the number of times is floor(488/10) = 48, but we have to check if 488 itself ends with an 8, which it does. So, 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490), but wait, 488 is less than 490. Wait, perhaps a better way is to calculate it as follows: The number of times 8 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488, which is 48 (since 48*10=480), and then check if the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include an 8 in the units place. Yes, 488 is included, so that's one more. So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, for the 480-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for all these 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, etc.) and one block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=40+9=49. Wait, but wait: from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Wait, let me think again. From 1-488, how many blocks of 100 are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. So, in each of the first four blocks, the tens digit is 4 in 10 numbers each, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last block, 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 401-409 and 410-419, but wait, no, the tens digit is 0 for 401-409, 1 for 410-419, etc. Wait, no, 401-410: the tens digit is 0 (401-410: 401,402,...410), 411-420: tens digit 1, so in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, right? So that's another 10 numbers. So total tens digit 4's: 4*10 (from 40-49, 140-149, etc.) plus 10 from 440-449. So that's 50. Hmm, that seems correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 =89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Wait, let me check that again: 49+50=99, plus 89=188. Hmm, that seems high. Wait, let me recount. Units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing a 4, and then one more at 484 (since 484 is 48*10 +4). So that's 49 fours in units place. Tens place: in each hundred, 10 numbers have 4 in tens place. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) each contribute 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is another 10. So total 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in hundreds place. So 89. So total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's see: starting at 8, each 10 numbers. The last one would be 488. So how many terms are there in this sequence? The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The common difference is 10. So the nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. Solving for n: 8 +10(n-1)=488 \u2192 10(n-1)=480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, we only go up to 488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's break it down: - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189:10 - 280-289:10 - 380-389:10 - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, because 488-480+1=9). Wait, no: 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488). So, in the 480-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and 9 in 480-488. So that's 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but wait: 80-89 is 10 numbers, but 480-488 is only 9. So, 4*10=40 plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the units and tens place eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98 eights. Wait, let me check that again: units place: 49, tens place:49, so total 98 eights. Now, the number of fours is 188, and eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's recount the fours: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 188. Eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0, total 98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.

Yes, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 in the hundreds place is only up to 488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the hundreds place being 4. So, for the tens place being 8, the numbers are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189: 10. From 200-299: 280-289:10. From 300-399: 380-389:10. From 400-488: 480-488: 9 numbers because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, for the tens place being 8 in the hundreds of 4, we have 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 10 (from 80-89) + 10 (180-189) +10 (280-289) +10 (380-389) +9 (480-488) = 49. Wait, but wait, is that correct?

So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Therefore, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears in page numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in page numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.  \n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.  \n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in page numbers from 400 to 488.  \n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   8 appears in page numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in page numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.  \n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9.  \n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.  \n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThere are \\boxed{90} more 4's printed than 8's."

    "text": " Wait, but wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? Well, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but wait, let me think again. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, inclusive. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is at 488. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the units place. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, so that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check that. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me just verify the counts again, especially for the hundreds place in fours and the tens place in eights. For fours in the hundreds place: from 400 to 488 inclusive. 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. Correct. For eights in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the last contributes 9, so 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Units place for both digits: 4's have 49, 8's have 49. So, yeah, 188 fours and 98 eights, difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Wait, but does that include all the 4's in the hundreds place? Yes, because from 400 to 488, every number has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is included. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, how many numbers? Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The last number is 488, which is 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, how many sets? Each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). Wait, is that right? Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, in the tens place, we have 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

    "text": " Wait, but wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, and 488 is beyond that, so yes, all those 10 numbers are included. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Wait, but actually, each number from 400 to 488 has 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 89. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, no, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours. Now, let me check if that's correct. Wait, wait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. But in the tens place, we had 50 fours, and in the units place, 49 fours. So, 89 + 50 is 139, plus 49 is 188. Hmm, that seems right. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is included, so let's see how many 8's are in the units place. The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. So, how many terms are there? The last term is 488, which is 8 in the units place. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms can be calculated by (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9). Wait, that's not quite right. Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book stops at 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, in the tens place, we have 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 10 each, so 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, 49 + 49 is 98. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For the 8's: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. That's correct. And for the tens place, 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. That's correct. Units place: 4,14,...,484. That's 49 numbers. So, 49 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's, units: 8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers. Tens: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 49 numbers. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. I think that's correct.

So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are.

So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's break it down: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 times 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place.

So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the fours: units place was 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, totaling 188. For the eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, totaling 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So that's correct. And for the eights in the tens place, I had 480-488 being 9 numbers, which is correct because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, yes, that's 9. So, 40 +9=49. So, the counts seem accurate. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.  \n   Each block contributes 10 occurrences, so:  \n   \\[\n   5 \\times 10 = 50\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in 400-488.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n   \\]\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\[\n49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.  \n   Each block (except the last) contributes 10 occurrences.  \n   \\[\n   4 \\times 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\[\n49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\\]\n\n**Difference:**  \n\\[\n188 - 98 = 90\n\\]\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 is another 10, 340-349 is another 10, and 440-449 is another 10. So that's 5 times 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, no, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484: 484 /10 = 48.4, so 49 times. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last set. So, how many sets? 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last, so 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers). So total in tens place: 10 + 10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. So total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (1s place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 484 / 10 = 48.4 \u2192 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens Place (10s place):**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place (100s place):**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total occurrences: 89 times.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (1s place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 488 / 10 = 48.8 \u2192 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens Place (10s place):**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block (480-488), which contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place (100s place):**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0 times.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, but wait, 440-449 is only up to 449, which is within 488, so that's okay. So, 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me check: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of fours is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 48*10=480, and then 488 is the next one. Wait, but 488 is the 49th 8 in the units place? Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 10*4 +9 =40 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me make sure. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of eights is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98 eights. Wait, but wait a second. Let me check the tens place again. When counting the tens place, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers (since 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9). So, 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, so 49. So, total eights:49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because 90 seems a bit high. Let me go through each digit place again for both fours and eights to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. That's 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 50 numbers. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: Units place: 8,18,28,...,488. That's 49 numbers. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, and the last block has 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is indeed 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the number of times the digits 4 and 8 appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Number of 4's:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Number of 8's:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.  \nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{90}."

But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so yes, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. So total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, which is 48*10 + 8. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is within the book, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each block except the last one has 10 numbers. Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)= 49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's.

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Wait, but that's only if we're considering the hundreds digit as 4.

Yes, because 488 is page 488, so the units digit is 8. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last set. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems right. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 89.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block which has 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
