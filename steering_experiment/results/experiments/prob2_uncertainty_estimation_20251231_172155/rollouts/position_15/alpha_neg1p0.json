    "text": " So, there are 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many full ranges there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then each subsequent hundred has another 10. So, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 occurrences. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488. So, 440-449 is okay because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 5 sets. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48 + 50 = 98, then 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 fours in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48 numbers. So, 48 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Let me count each set: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10 numbers. 280-289: 10 numbers. 380-389: 10 numbers. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 48 + 49 + 0 = 97. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 97 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4 to 484, totaling 48 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400 to 488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8 to 488, totaling 48 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with an additional 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n- **Total 8's:** 48 + 49 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, there are 48 4's in the units place. Wait, but wait, 488 is the last page. So, 484 is the last page with a 4 in the units place. Let me confirm: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The formula is floor(488/10) = 48, since 48*10=480, and 480+4=484. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5*10=50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, total 4's printed are 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, last is 488. So, using the same method: floor(488/10)=48. But wait, 488 ends with an 8, so the number of 8's in the units place is 49? Wait, let me check. Because 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, from 8, 18, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: does 480-489 exist? But 488 is the last page, so 480-488 has 9 numbers (480-488), but only the tens digit is 8, so 480-488 has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Wait, but in the tens place, 480-488 would have the tens digit as 8 for all of them, right? Because 480 is 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's 9 numbers. But wait, in the tens place, each block is 100 numbers, so 400-499 would have 10 numbers with tens digit 8: 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, we only have 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens place in 400-488 contributes 9 8's. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, plus the 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. Wait, but let me confirm. From 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488:9 numbers. So, total 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's printed are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484)\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449)\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488)\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488)\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488)\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences (since the book ends at 488)\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence, right? Let me check: 4,14,...,484. So, yes, 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range, but 494 would be beyond. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 would be within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, no, wait. Actually, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4, so each of these numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction, it's 48 full tens, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, the number of 8's in the units place is 49? Wait, let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? It's the same as the number of times 8 appears in the units place, which is every 10 numbers. So, starting at 8, 18, ..., 488. The number of terms is floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 is exactly 48*10 + 8, so it's 49 numbers. Wait, no, let me calculate it correctly. The number of terms is (last term - first term)/common difference + 1. Here, first term is 8, last term is 488, common difference is 10. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 80-89, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. Now, from 400-488: The next range would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the hundreds digit 4. So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). Wait, but I'm counting the tens place. So, in the tens place, the 8 appears in 480-488 as well, but that's only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, let me adjust. For the tens place, the full ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4 ranges of 10 (40) plus 9, so 49. Wait, but let me check again. From 0-99: 80-89: 10. 100-199:180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. Therefore, the hundreds place has 0 occurrences of 8. So, total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, ..., 484 \u2192 48 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences (since the book ends at 488).\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " But wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of 4's in the units place is the number of complete decades (sets of 10) plus any extra. The total number of units digits is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit goes up to 8. So, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is within 488. So, 48 occurrences. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges exist. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another, another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, another 10. 300-399: 340-349, another 10. 400-488: 440-449, another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many ranges is that? 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4 in each place: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's printed: 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many times. The last page is 488, so the units digit 8 occurs at 488. To find how many times, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488, which is the 48th occurrence. Wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of such numbers is floor(488/10) = 48. Because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 48 occurrences. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such ranges exist. From 0-99: 80-89 is one range, 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189, another 10. 200-299: 280-289, another 10. 300-399: 380-389, another 10. 400-488: Now, does 480-489 fall within 488? 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, the last number is 488. So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, in the tens place, the 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but earlier ranges (like 80-89, etc.) have 10 numbers each. So, how many ranges with full 10 numbers? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 0 occurrences. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8 in each place: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, total 8's printed: 97. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Total ranges: 5, each contributing 10 numbers.\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 89.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Full ranges: 4, contributing 10 each.\n   - Partial range (480-488): 9 numbers.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 48 + 49 + 0 = 97.\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 x 10 = 50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 in the hundreds place appears in numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in each of these numbers, the hundreds digit is 4, so each contributes one 4. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's printed are 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 48 x 10 = 480, so the last 8 in the units place is 488, which is correct. So, 48 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which is 480-488. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-488. Now, how many numbers are there from 480 to 488? That's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, the 8's are in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 4 full ranges of 10 each and one partial range of 9. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, total 8's printed are 97. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4 to 484, totaling 48 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in numbers 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n   \nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8 to 488, totaling 48 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last range being 480-488, totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's appear here as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 48 + 49 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, there are 48 fours in the units place. Wait, but 484 is the 48th number. Let me check: 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Oh, I see, I made a mistake earlier. It should be 49 fours in the units place because when you include both the first and last terms, you have to add 1. So, 49 fours in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, we have 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? Yes, 449 is less than 488, so all five ranges are valid. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. Each number here has a hundreds digit of 4. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. Using the same method as before: (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such ranges are there? Let's see: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10. That's 4 ranges, each contributing 10 eights. So, 4 *10=40 eights in the tens place. Wait, but does 380-389 fall within 488? Yes, because 389 is less than 488. So, 40 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 800 onwards, but wait, the book only has 488 pages. So, there are no page numbers with an 8 in the hundreds place because 800 is way beyond 488. Therefore, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 +40=89. So, there are 89 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 fours - 89 eights = 99.

Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, let's see how many such ranges there are. Starting from 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such ranges there are. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. Now, does 480-489 fall within the 488 pages? Yes, because 488 is the last page. So, 480-489: 10 numbers, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's only 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, that's a problem. So, for the tens place, the range 480-489 would only contribute 9 numbers because 489 is beyond 488. So, let me correct that. The first three ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 numbers, so 4 ranges * 10 = 40. The last range, 480-488, contributes 9 numbers. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. Wait, no. Wait, let me recount. 80-89: 10. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9. So that's 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So total 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are there than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence because starting from 4, each 10 numbers add one more. So, units place: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place, 4 can appear in the tens digit. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there? From 1 to 488, we have four blocks: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. Wait, actually, 400-488 is the fifth block. But in each block, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 times. Wait, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 only in the numbers 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. To count how many, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers add one more. Wait, let me think. The first 8 is at 8, which is the 1st occurrence. Then 18 is the 2nd, and so on. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks are there? From 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers). 101-200: 180-189 (10 numbers). 201-300: 280-289 (10 numbers). 301-400: 380-389 (10 numbers). 401-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), because 489 is beyond 488. So, in the last block, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, total tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so yes, 49 total. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, let me check the units place for 4's. From 4 to 484, every 10 numbers. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Wait, that's 49, but earlier I thought it was 48. Did I make a mistake there? Let me recalculate. If the first term is 4 (which is the 1st term), then the last term is 484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place for 4's is 49, not 48. Oh, I see, I made a mistake earlier. I thought it was 48, but it's actually 49. So, units place for 4's: 49. Tens place for 4's: 50. Hundreds place: 89. So total 4's: 49+50+89=188. Wait, that changes things. Let me correct that. So, 49 (units) +50 (tens)=99, plus 89 (hundreds)=188. Now, for 8's, units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 8's:98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, so I had an error in counting the units place for 4's. It's actually 49, not 48. So, the correct total for 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90. Let me verify this again. Units place for 4's: starting at 4, ending at 484. Number of terms: (484 -4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. So, units:49. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place:400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place:8,18,...,488. Number of terms: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. The first four blocks have 10 each, and the last block has 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. So, total 8's:49+49=98. Therefore, difference:188-98=90. So, I initially made a mistake in counting the units place for 4's, but upon correction, the difference is 90. Wait, but let me check again: when counting units place for 4's, I have 49 numbers. Similarly, for 8's, units place is 49. So, the 4's in units place are 49, 8's in units place are 49. Then, for tens place, 4's have 50, 8's have 49. And hundreds place, 4's have 89, 8's have 0. So, adding up, 4's:49+50+89=188. 8's:49+49=98. 188-98=90.

So, 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. Since we're dealing with 488 pages, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187. Wait, let me check that addition again. 48 + 50 is 98, and 98 + 89 is 187. Yes, that's correct. So, there are 187 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is included. So, how many such numbers? Let me calculate. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. To find the count, I can take 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, does that mean there are 49 occurrences? Because from 8 to 488, each 10 numbers contribute one 8 in the units place. Let me think differently. The number of times 8 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete tens in 488. For example, from 1 to 488, how many full sets of 10 are there? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 48 \u00d7 10 = 480, so from 1 to 480, there are 48 eights in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the next number with an 8 in the units place is 488. So, that's one more. So, total is 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Each of these ranges (except the last one) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count them: - 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, adding these up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the occurrences of 8: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Wait, that seems a bit high, but let me check. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so total 98. Hmm, okay. So, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, I subtract 98 from 187: 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. For the 4's: Units: 48, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. Total: 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. That seems correct. For the 8's: Units: 49, Tens: 49, Hundreds: 0. Total: 49 + 49 = 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, let me think again about the units place for 8's. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? Well, the first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms are there in this sequence? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488. So, 8 + 10(n-1) \u2264 488 \u2192 10(n-1) \u2264 480 \u2192 n-1 \u2264 48 \u2192 n \u2264 49. So, 49 terms. So, that's correct. Similarly, for the tens place, each range of 100 contributes 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except the last one, which is 480-488, contributing 9. So, 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one partial range (480-488). So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. That's correct. So, 49 in the tens place. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. So, yes, 98 eights. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4 \u2192 48 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each full range contributes 10 numbers, and the last range contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers in 800-899, so 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **89**\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " So, there are 48 4's in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does 484 exist? Yes, because 484 is less than 488. So, 48 it is. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but from 400-488, the range is 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction, we take 48 full groups. But wait, 48 \u00d7 10 = 480, so the 48th group ends at 480, and then 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, actually, there are 49 8's in the units place. Wait, let me check: from 1-488, how many multiples of 10 plus 8? The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 80-89 is one range, contributing 10 8's. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have 4 ranges of 10 and one range of 9. So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).

    "text": " So, there are 48 instances where 4 appears in the units place. Wait, but let me check: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? It's the same as the number of times 4 appears in the units place. So, every 10 numbers, there's one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full decades, each contributing one 4. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49, which is in the 40's. Then, each subsequent hundred has another block: 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many blocks is that? From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 instances where 4 is in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens in the range 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 instances where 4 is in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 48 times. Wait, but 488 is included, so let me check: 488 is the last page, which ends with 8, so that should be included. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, but the last group has 888, which is beyond 488, so actually, the last 8 in the units place is at 488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's think differently. The number of times 8 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades plus any extra. Since 488 is 48 full decades (1-480) and then 8 more pages (481-488). So, in each decade, 1-10, 11-20, etc., the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each decade, 8 appears once in the units place. There are 48 full decades (1-480), so 48 times. Then, in the last partial decade, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 8 appears once in the units place here as well (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, let me verify. Alternatively, the number of units digits 8 is equal to the number of times 8 occurs in 1-488. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 itself ends with 8, we add 1, making it 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. This occurs in blocks of 100, specifically in the 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. That's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block, which is only up to 488, so 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. Wait, 480 is 480, which has 8 in the tens place, and 488 is 488, which also has 8 in the tens place. So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, for the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributes 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. The last block, 480-488, contributes 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 4\u00d710 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 times in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, but earlier I thought units was 49 and tens was 49, so 98 total. Now, let's compare the counts: Number of 4's: 187, Number of 8's: 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to miscount, especially with the ranges.\n\nFirst, for the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 times. Let me see: from 1-488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4. So, 48. But wait, does 488 include another 4 in the units place? No, because 488 ends with 8, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484. So, 48 times. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. Wait, earlier I thought 5 blocks, but let me confirm. The blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Correct.\n\nNow for the 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49 times. Let me see: from 1-488, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. 488 \u00f710=48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But since 488 is included, which ends with 8, that's an extra 1, making it 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 5 blocks, but the last block is only 9 numbers. So, 4 blocks \u00d710=40, plus 9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 +49=98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 187-98=89. So, 89 more 4's than 8's. That seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " So, there are 48 4's in the units place. Wait, but let me check. The last page is 488, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is correct. So, from 4 to 484, that's 48 numbers. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first block, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but I should check if the last block, 440-449, is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens for all numbers from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. Therefore, there are 89 4's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, I'll do the same process for the digit 8. Let's count the number of 8's in each digit position. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. To find how many such numbers there are, I can take 488 and divide by 10, which gives 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48. So, 48 8's in the units place. But wait, let me check: starting at 8, each step of 10, so 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that's different from my initial thought. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. The correct way is to use the formula: number of terms = ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, for units place 8's, first term is 8, last term is 488, step is 10. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let me check each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place. - 180-189: another 10 8's. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: how many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, each of these blocks contributes 10 except the last one, which contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. Wait, but let me count again. The blocks are 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, the total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Wait, but let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens place: 49. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. Now, comparing the number of 4's (187) and 8's (98). The difference is 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This is 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book doesn't reach 800.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " But wait, let me check. From 1 to 488, how many times does the units digit cycle through 0-9? It's 48 full cycles (since 480 is 48*10), and then 8 more numbers (481-488). So in each cycle of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So 48 full cycles give 48 fours, and in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear again. So total 4's in units place: 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the blocks are: 40-49 (40-49), 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This would be from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So total fours: 187. Now, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Let's count the number of 8's in each place. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so in the 49th cycle, we have 488, which is an 8 in the units place. So that's 49 times. Let me check: from 1 to 480, there are 480/10 = 48 eights in the units place, and then 488 is the 49th. So units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. This occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let me count how many full blocks there are. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place, and the last block contributes 9. So that's 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. So yes, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8 in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only when the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So no eights in the hundreds place. So total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 89. So there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades (480 numbers) plus 8 extra numbers (481-488). Thus, 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks of 10 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 occurrences. Thus, 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in all numbers from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Thus, 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers.

There are 4 full blocks contributing 10 each and the last block (480-488) contributing 9. Thus, 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

Oh, so I was wrong earlier. It's actually 49 fours in the units place. Hmm, I need to be careful here. So, the correct count is 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges exist. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488? Yes, 449 is within 488, so all those 10 numbers are valid. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the range for the last one. Let's check each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289:10 numbers. - 380-389:10 numbers. - 480-488: Here, the numbers are 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, for the tens place, we have 4 ranges with 10 numbers each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) totaling 4*10=40, plus the last range 480-488 which has 9 numbers. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

Let me check: 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so the integer part is 48, which means 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, that's 48 4's. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, how many ranges is that? Let's see: 40-49 is one, then 140-149 is another, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Wait, but 400 to 488 is 89 numbers because 488 - 400 is 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Let's count the number of 8's in each place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last page is 488, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. So, 48 8's in the units place. Wait, but 488 is included, so let me check: 488 is the 48th multiple? Wait, no, 488 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 8. Wait, 8, 18, ..., 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, so that's 49 8's in the units place. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because when I did 488 / 10, I got 48.8, but that's not the right way to count. The correct way is to use the formula: number of terms = ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's see how many ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers? Let me check: 488 - 480 = 8, so 8 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens place is 8 for 9 numbers. So, how many 8's in the tens place? For the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributes 10 numbers, so 4 ranges * 10 = 40. Then, the last range (480-488) contributes 9 numbers. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. Similarly for 180-189, etc. So, 4 ranges * 10 = 40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units place: 48, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. Total 4's: 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. For the 8's: units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. Total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, that seems correct.

This happens in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many sets of 100 there are. From 1-488, the hundreds digits go from 0 (for 1-99) to 4 (for 400-488). So, for each hundred, the 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (e.g., 40-49).

So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 times. Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but does 488 end before 449? No, 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So, 5 sets, 10 each, total 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This happens in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, the total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 +50=99, 99 +89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers. Let me break it down: - 0-99: 80-89 \u219210 numbers. - 100-199:180-189 \u219210 numbers. - 200-299:280-289 \u219210 numbers. - 300-399:380-389 \u219210 numbers. - 400-488:480-488 \u21929 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but wait, our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 0 times. So, the total number of 8's is units + tens =49 +49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) -98 (number of 8's)=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences (since the book ends at 488).\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 only in 400-499, but since the book ends at 488, it's 400-488. So, 89 numbers where the hundreds digit is 4. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many 8's in the units place? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. To find how many terms, I can use (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let me count how many such ranges there are. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 4 *10 =40 times. But wait, is 480-489 in the book? The book ends at 488, so 480-488 would have the tens digit as 8 for 480-488. That's 9 numbers (from 480 to 488). Wait, so I missed that. So, in the hundreds place, the tens digit can also be 8 in 480-488. So, that's an additional 9 numbers. So, total in the tens place is 4*10 +9=49. Wait, let me check that again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) -98 (number of 8's)=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

But actually, each set of 10 numbers contributes one 4 in the units place, so from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4. So, 48 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. Let me count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each hundred has a set of ten numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, in the 1st hundred (1-100), it's 40-49: 10 numbers. Similarly, in the 2nd hundred (101-200), it's 140-149: 10 numbers. In the 3rd hundred (201-300), it's 240-249: 10 numbers. In the 4th hundred (301-400), it's 340-349: 10 numbers. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's, so 5\u00d710=50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is part of the 400-488 range, so that's correct. So, total 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 up to page 488. So, from 400 to 488, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 1 to 488, how many multiples of 10 are there? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. So, 48 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many full sets and the partial set. Each full hundred has 80-89, which is 10 numbers. So, in 1-100: 80-89: 10 numbers. 101-200: 180-189: 10 numbers. 201-300: 280-289: 10 numbers. 301-400: 380-389: 10 numbers. Now, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the full hundreds contribute 4 sets \u00d710 = 40, and the partial set contributes 9. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place starting from 800, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, 97 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " So, there are 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence because 48*10 = 480, and then 484 is the next one. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as the number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. Let me calculate it as follows: The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Now, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges in total. Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding them all up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups. So, 48 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such ranges are there up to 488. From 0-99: 80-89 is one range. From 100-199: 180-189 is another. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. Now, from 400-488: The next range would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, only 480-488 are valid. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but when considering the tens place, each range is 10 numbers, so 480-489 would be a range, but since we stop at 488, it's only 9 numbers. So, how many full ranges are there? Let's see: 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers) 100-199: 180-189 (10) 200-299: 280-289 (10) 300-399: 380-389 (10) 400-488: 480-488 (9) So, the first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but when I count the tens place, each occurrence is when the tens digit is 8, so each full range contributes 10. But in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only from 480-489, but since we go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, the number of 8's in the tens place is 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 10 each, and then 9 more from 480-488. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, total 8's are 97. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). \n   - Number of 4's = \u230a488 / 10\u230b = 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449.\n   - Number of ranges = 5 (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of pages = 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nTotal 4's = 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Number of 8's = \u230a488 / 10\u230b = 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488.\n   - Full ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 (4 ranges \u00d7 10 = 40).\n   - Partial range: 480-488 (9 numbers).\n   - Total = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n**Difference:**\nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 187 - 97 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid, but 480-489 would go beyond 488. Let me calculate how many full sets of 100 there are. From 1-488, there are four full hundreds: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. In each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, for each hundred, that's 10 numbers. There are four hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40. But wait, the last hundred is 400-488. Let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 40 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: 48 (units) + 40 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 177. So, there are 177 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, similar to the 4's, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48.8, so 48 full occurrences. Wait, but 488 is included. So, 488 is the 49th occurrence? Let me think. From 1-488, the number of 8's in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades. Each decade (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 8 in the units place. So, how many decades are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, so 48 occurrences. But wait, 488 is the last page, which is 488. So, in the 488th page, the units digit is 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, because from 1-10, the 8 is at 8 (1 occurrence). From 11-20, at 18 (2nd occurrence). So, each decade adds one, and since 488 is the 49th decade (since 488 is in the 49th set: 481-490, but 490 is beyond 488). Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute how many times 8 appears in the units place: it's the floor division of 488 by 10, which is 48, plus 1 if the last digit is 8 or higher. Since 488 ends with 8, which is equal to 8, so we add 1. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but let me check: from 1-480, each 10 numbers have one 8, so 48 times. Then from 481-488, the 8 is at 488, which is one more. So total 49. So, 49 occurrences in units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many full sets of 100 we have. Each hundred contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-488, how many full hundreds are there? Four: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. In each of the first four hundreds (1-399), the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers each. So, 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up the 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought the units place was 49 and tens place was 49, totaling 98. But let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89: 10 numbers. From 180-189: another 10. From 280-289: another 10. From 380-389: another 10. That's 4 sets, totaling 40. Then, in 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, 40 + 9 = 49 in the tens place. So, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the number of 4's was 177. So, the difference is 177 - 98 = 79. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's. Let me recount the 4's: units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, step 10. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, earlier I thought it was 48, but maybe it's 49. Wait, because when you have 484, which is 484, so (484 - 4)/10 = 48, so 48 +1 = 49. So, units place 4's: 49. Similarly, in the tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 40. Wait, because the book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid, but 480-489 is beyond 488, so in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, so 5*10=50. But wait, earlier I thought it was 40, but that must have been a mistake. So, units place:49, tens place:50, hundreds place:89 (from 400-488, which is 89 numbers). So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. Wait, that's different from before. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify. Let me use a systematic approach. For units place 4's: every 10 numbers, starting at 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49. For tens place 4's: in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. From 1-488, how many hundreds have 4 in the tens place? 400-488 is the last hundred, so let's see: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, so 5*10=50. So, 50. For hundreds place 4's: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, 89. So total 4's:49+50+89=188. Now, for 8's: units place: every 10 numbers, starting at 8,18,...,488. So, (488-8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9 (since 488 is included). So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9: 4*10 +9=49. Hundreds place: none, as before. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 79, but now I'm getting 90. I must have made a mistake in the initial count. Let me verify again. Units place 4's:49, tens place 4's:50, hundreds place 4's:89. Total 4's:188. Units place 8's:49, tens place 8's:49. Total 8's:98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. But wait, let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89. That's correct. For 8's, hundreds place:0. So, yes, 98. So, difference is 90. But wait, in the initial problem, the book has 488 pages, so page 488 is included. So, in the units place for 4's, 484 is the last one, which is correct. For 8's, units place goes up to 488, which is correct. So, I think the correct difference is 90. But wait, let me check the 4's in the tens place again. From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. So, yes, 50. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90. Wait, but earlier I thought 4's were 177 and 8's were 98, giving 79. But after rechecking, I see that the correct count for 4's is 188. So, the correct difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (4, 14, 24, ..., 484):**\n   - The number of terms is calculated by ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449):**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4.\n   - There are 5 such sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place (400-488):**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (8, 18, 28, ..., 488):**\n   - The number of terms is ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488):**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last set.\n   - There are 4 full sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - The last set (480-488) contributes 9 numbers.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence, right? Because 484 is 48*10 + 4. So, that's 48 times. But wait, let me check. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? It's floor(488/10) = 48, since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. Then 100-199: 140-149. 200-299: 240-249. 300-399: 340-349. 400-488: 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another range. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5*10 = 50 times. Wait, but wait, 440-449 is only up to 449, and the book goes up to 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers. From 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 times? Wait, no, because 488 is the 48th number after 0. Wait, let me think. The first occurrence is at 8, which is the 8th number. Then every 10 numbers after that. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers ending with 8? It's (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 80-89 is one range. 100-199: 180-189. 200-299: 280-289. 300-399: 380-389. 400-488: Now, does 480-489 fall within 400-488? 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, only 480-488 are valid, which is 9 numbers. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, how many ranges? The first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 numbers, and then 480-488 contributes 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but wait, 480-488 is within the 400-488 range, so the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times there. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 (from 80-89, etc.) + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, but wait, let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. Yes, that's correct. So, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. And in the tens place, 50 times, units 48 times. So, 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. For 8's, units 49, tens 49, so 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   - The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Number of 4's: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - The digit 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).  \n   - Number of 4's: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - The digit 4 appears from page 400 to 488, inclusive.  \n   - Number of 4's: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\( 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   - The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Number of 8's: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\) (since 488 is included).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - The digit 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   - Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 numbers, and the last range (480-488) contributes 9 numbers.  \n   - Number of 8's: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.  \n   - Number of 8's: \\( 0 \\).\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**  \n\\( 187 - 98 = 89 \\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " So, there are 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, but let me check that. If I take 488 divided by 10, that's 48.8, so the integer part is 48. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, from 0-400, there are 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. That's 4 x 10 = 40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. So, total 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. So, 48 occurrences. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers. From 0-488, how many such ranges? Let's see, 0-488 includes four full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing one range of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So that's 4 x 10 = 40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's 9 occurrences. Therefore, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me check: from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 9. So, total tens place 8's: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place starting from 800, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. Therefore, hundreds place 8's: 0. So, total 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the total 8's from the total 4's: 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. That seems correct. For 8's: units 48, tens 49, hundreds 0. 48 + 49 is 97. So, 187 - 97 = 90. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me recount the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. Correct. For 8's, in the tens place, from 400-488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. Correct. Units place: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 numbers. Correct. So, the difference is indeed 90.

So, for each ten numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the number of 4's in the units place is the number of complete tens in 488. That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 times. So, 48 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are.

So, 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, but I need to check if 488 is included. Yes, because 488 is page 488, so it's included. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's printed are 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? From 1 to 488, the last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 times? Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th occurrence. Let me think: starting at 8, then 18, 28,..., 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 80-89 is one range, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: Now, 480-489 would be the next range, but since the book ends at 488, the range is 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. Wait, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, for 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, for the tens place, we have 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 8's, and then an incomplete range in 480-488 contributing 9 8's. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such ranges.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in page numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\) (since 488 is included).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - There are 4 full ranges (each contributing 10) and an incomplete range (480-488) contributing 9.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**\n\\( 187 \\text{ (4's)} - 98 \\text{ (8's)} = 89 \\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " So, there are 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, but let me check: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete groups of 10 in 488, which is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. So, 48 times. That seems correct. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. So, 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's okay. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Wait, that seems high. Let me think again. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, the number of numbers is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, the last occurrence in the units place is 488. So, how many times? From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8. So, 48 times. Wait, but 488 is included, so does that add an extra? Let me check: 488 is the 489th number, but since we're counting up to 488, the units digit cycles 48 times, with the 48th group ending at 480, and then 481-488 are the next 8 numbers. So, in the units place, 8 appears once in each group of 10, so 48 times. So, 48 occurrences in units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488). Each block contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which contributes 9. So, how many blocks? From 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, total is 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, 97 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Number of occurrences: \u230a488/10\u230b = 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n   - Number of blocks: 5 (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Number of occurrences: \u230a488/10\u230b = 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n   - Number of complete blocks: 4 (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399).\n   - Each contributes 10, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Last block (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No numbers have 8 in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n   - Occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 48 + 49 + 0 = 97.\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence, but actually, since 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4, I think it's 49 occurrences because we start counting from 0. Wait, no, let me think again. If I consider from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra in the last incomplete decade. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (at 484). So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers) From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers) From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers) From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers, since 440-449 is within 400-488). Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So that's 5 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), each contributing 10 4's. So 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, in the last block, 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So total tens place 4's: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. So total hundreds place 4's: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, which is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 8. So, similar to the 4's, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once (at 488). So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last one, which is only 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 numbers. So, let's break it down: - 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers) - 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers) - 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers) - 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers) - 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers). So, the first four blocks each contribute 10 8's, and the last block contributes 9. So total tens place 8's: (4 * 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So total hundreds place 8's: 0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations because 90 seems high. Let me recount the 4's: units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct. For the 8's: units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. Let me check that again. For the tens place 8's: 80-89: 10 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So 49 in tens place. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so total 98. 4's:188, 8's:98. Difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete decades (1-480) contributing 48 fours, plus one more in 484, totaling 49.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10 fours.

    "text": " So, there are 48 4's in the units place. Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so yes, that's correct. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has exactly 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. But wait, 0 in the hundreds place would correspond to the two-digit numbers, but let's see: For the tens place, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, each of these hundreds contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many hundreds blocks do we have? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, the last block is 400-488. How many numbers are there where the tens digit is 4 in this block? It's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 50 in total. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. To find how many, divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48. But wait, 488 is included, so it's actually 48 + 1 = 49? Wait, let me think. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Each full block (like 0-99, 100-199, etc.) contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count the blocks: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers, except the last one, which might be incomplete. Wait, in the last block, 400-488, the tens digit 8 would be in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the first four blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributes 10 numbers, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the last block, 400-488, we have 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (480-488). So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the hundreds digit is 8. But since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4, 14, ..., 484. There are 48 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. There are 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8, 18, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 40, and the last block contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " So, there are 48 4's in the units place. Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence because 48 * 10 = 480, but 484 is the 48th? Hmm, actually, let's see: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms can be calculated by (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. So, it's 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there? From 1-488, there are 4 hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488. Wait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so the hundreds go up to 400, and then 401-488. So, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. To find how many: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block is 10 numbers. How many such blocks? From 1-488, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Wait, is 480-489 included? But our book ends at 488, so 480-488 would be part of the 400-488 range, but the tens digit is 8 only in 480-489. However, since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the hundreds place, 400-488: the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that. So, in the tens place, the 8's occur in:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 +10+10+10+9=49.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier I thought it was 4 blocks, but now I'm seeing 5 blocks. Let me check again.\n\nFrom 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nSo, that's 5 blocks, with the last block having 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4 blocks, but now I see 5. Hmm, perhaps I need to recount.\n\nWait, 80-89 is the first block, then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and then 480-488. So that's 5 blocks, yes. So, 4 blocks with 10 each, and the fifth with 9. So, total 4*10 +9=49.\n\nSo, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units were 49 and tens were 49, so total 98. Now, for 4's, I had 188. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's. Let me recount the 4's:\n\nUnits place: 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49.\n\nTens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488: how many numbers? 488-400+1=89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place:8,18,...,488. Number of terms: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49.\n\nTens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nSo, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought earlier that in the tens place for 8's, it's 49, but I'm not sure if I counted correctly. Let me think again.\n\nIn the tens place, for 8's, from 80-89:10 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, the total 8's are 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so 188-98=90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in the hundreds place, I might have missed something. Let me check again.\n\nFor 4's in the hundreds place: from 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488-400+1=89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nFor 8's in the hundreds place: none, since the book ends at 488, so no page numbers start with 8.\n\nSo, I think my counts are correct. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** 4,14,24,...,484. Number of terms: (484 - 4)/10 +1 = 49.\n   - **Tens place:** 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block contributes 10, so 5\u00d710=50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 400-488. Number of terms: 488 - 400 +1 = 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 +89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:**8,18,...,488. Number of terms: (488 -8)/10 +1 =49.\n   - **Tens place:**80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each block contributes 10 except the last, which contributes 9. Total: 10\u00d74 +9=49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** None, as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:**49 +49=98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, there are 48 4's in the units place. Wait, but wait a second. 488 is the last page, so 484 is indeed the last number where 4 is in the units place. So, 48 numbers. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many sets of ten there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449 each give 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is included, so how many such numbers? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, so actually, it's 49 numbers because from 8 to 488, each 10 numbers contribute one 8 in the units place. Wait, let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So, starting at 8, each step is +10, so the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1. Let's compute that: (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the tens place because the tens digit is 8. So, let's count each set. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. And then 480-488: how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 187-98=89. Yes, that seems correct. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. There are 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. There are 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear. There are 0 occurrences.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89.\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{89}."

    "text": " So, there are 48 fours in the units place. Wait, but let me check that. If I take the floor of 484/10, that's 48, but actually, 484 is the 48th number because 48*10=480, but 484 is 484, so maybe it's 48 or 49? Hmm, maybe I should think differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in the total number of pages. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups. Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 fours. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 include a 4 in the units place? No, because 488 ends with 8. So, the last 4 in the units place would be 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 fours in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, that's 10 fours. From 100-199: 140-149 is another, another 10 fours. Similarly, 240-249: 10 fours, 340-349: 10 fours, and 440-449: 10 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, let me check the last range: 440-449. The book goes up to 488, so 449 is within the book, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have a 4. That would be from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up the fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The last page is 488, which ends with 8. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 48 eights in the units place. Wait, but 488 is included, so does that add an extra? Let me check: 488 is the 48th group, but 488 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 8, so 8, 18, ..., 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, that's (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, so maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me recalculate. The number of times 8 appears in the units place is the number of numbers from 1 to 488 that end with 8. The first is 8, the last is 488. The count is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89 is one range, contributing 10 eights in the tens place. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10 eights. Similarly, 280-289: 10 eights, 380-389: 10 eights, and 480-488: here, the tens digit is 8, but the units digits go from 0 to 8, so that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, for the 480-488 range, the tens place is 8 for 9 numbers. So, the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights, and the last range (480-488) contributes 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** A 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 48 such numbers (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, taking the integer part).\n   \n2. **Tens place:** A 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each range contributes 10 fours, and there are 5 such ranges (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-499). Thus, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** A 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** An 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). Since 488 is included, there are 49 such numbers.\n\n2. **Tens place:** An 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 eights each, and the last range (480-488) contributes 9 eights. Total = 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

Hmm, maybe I should check that. Let's see, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then every 10 numbers. So, the number of such numbers is floor(488/10) which is 48.

For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, that's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. So, all numbers from 400 to 488 have 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 4's. Now, adding them up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 can appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 ends with 88, which is 8 in the units place. So, how many such numbers? From 8, 18, ..., 488. The last one is 488, which is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. But wait, 48*10 is 480, so 480 +8 is 488, which is included. So, 48 numbers where 8 is in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these contributes 10 numbers. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89 is one. From 100-199: 180-189 is another. Similarly, 280-289 and 380-389. So, that's 4 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. But wait, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Wait, 480-489 is beyond 488, so the last page is 488, which is before 489. So, 480-488: the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but in the tens place, 80-89, 180-189, etc., each have 10 numbers. However, in the case of 480-488, it's only 9 numbers because 489 is beyond 488. So, I need to adjust for that. So, the ranges are: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9 numbers. So total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 4 ranges, but actually, 480-488 is another range where tens digit is 8, so that's 5 ranges, but the last one has only 9 numbers. So total is 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 +49=97. So, total 8's are 97. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) -97 (number of 8's)=90. Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check my calculations because 90 seems a bit high. Let me go through the 4's again. Units place: 48. Tens place: 50. Hundreds place:89. 48+50=98+89=187. That seems correct. Now, 8's: units place:48. Tens place:49. So, 48+49=97. 187-97=90. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Wait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. From 80-89:10. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, total 8's:48+49=97. So, 187-97=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, I'm a bit unsure because sometimes in counting problems, it's easy to miscount, especially in the higher ranges. Let me try another approach to verify. For 4's: Let's count how many times 4 appears in each position. Units: For each group of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. From 1-488, there are 48 full groups of 10 (since 48*10=480), and then 8 more numbers (481-488). In each group, 4 appears once, so 48 times. Additionally, in the last partial group, 481-488, does 4 appear in the units place? 484 is in this range, so that's one more. So, total units place 4's:48+1=49. Wait, that contradicts my earlier count of 48. Hmm, which is correct? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, but since 488 is included, and 488 has 8 in the units place, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is 48th occurrence. So, 48 times. So, maybe my initial count was correct. Alternatively, using the formula: number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N is floor(N/10). So, floor(488/10)=48. So, 48 times. Similarly, for 8's in units place: floor(488/10)=48, but wait, 488 is included, so 488 is the 49th occurrence? Wait, no, because 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, starting at 8. So, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 times. Wait, let me think. From 8,18,...,488. So, the first is 8, which is the 1st, then 18 is 2nd, ..., 488 is the 49th. So, that's 49 times. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, this is conflicting. Let me clarify. The formula is floor((N - d)/10) +1, where d is the digit. So, for 8 in units place up to 488: floor((488 -8)/10)+1= floor(480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. So, I was wrong earlier; it's 49, not 48. So, that changes things. So, units place for 8's is 49. Then, tens place: as before, 49. So, total 8's:49+49=98. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 97. Hmm, let me recalculate. Units place:49. Tens place:49. So, total 8's:98. Then, 4's:187. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, that's different from before. So, which is correct? I think I made a mistake in the initial count for units place of 8's. Let me use the formula correctly. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N is given by floor((N)/10). But wait, actually, the correct formula is floor((N + 1 - d)/10). Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think differently. For units digit, the number of times 8 appears is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus one if the last number in the range is >= the digit. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? The first occurrence is 8, then every 10 numbers. The last occurrence is 488. So, the number of times is (488 -8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. So, I was wrong earlier; it's 49, not 48. So, units place for 8's:49. Similarly, for 4's in units place: from 4,14,...,484. The last occurrence is 484, which is within 488. So, (484 -4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Wait, but 484 is the 49th occurrence. But earlier, I thought it was 48. Hmm, but 488/10=48.8, so floor is 48, but using the formula, it's 49. So, which is correct? Let's list some numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 4 +10(n-1)=484. So, 10(n-1)=480. n-1=48. So, n=49. So, 49 times. So, I was wrong earlier; it's 49, not 48. So, units place for 4's:49. Similarly, units place for 8's:49. Now, let's recount 4's. Units:49. Tens:50. Hundreds:89. Total:49+50=99+89=188. Wait, earlier I had 187, but now it's 188. Let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488-400+1=89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, 49+50+89=188. Now, 8's: units:49. Tens:49. Hundreds:0. Total:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but now I'm getting 90 again. But earlier, when I corrected the units place for 8's, I thought it was 49, leading to 98 8's, and 188 4's, so 188-98=90. So, the difference is 90. But wait, earlier I thought 4's were 187, but now it's 188. So, I need to reconcile this. Let me recount the 4's. Units place:49. Tens place:50. Hundreds place:89. Total:49+50=99+89=188. So, yes, 188 4's. 8's: units:49. Tens:49. Total:98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the units place for 4's was 48, but now it's 49. Let me confirm with a smaller example. Suppose N=44. How many 4's in units place? 4,14,24,34,44. That's 5 times. Using the formula: (44 -4)/10 +1=40/10 +1=4+1=5. Correct. So, for N=488, 4's in units place: (488-4)/10 +1=484/10 +1=48.4 +1=49.4, but since we take integer, it's 49. So, correct. Similarly, 8's in units place: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, correct. So, 4's in units place:49. 8's in units place:49. Now, for 4's in tens place: ranges are 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5 ranges. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so all 10 numbers are included. So, 5*10=50. So, 50 4's in tens place. Similarly, 8's in tens place: ranges are 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 4 ranges with 10 numbers each, and one range with 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 8's in tens place. So, total 8's:49+49=98. Total 4's:49+50+89=188. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, from 4, 14, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, from 8, 18, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book only goes up to 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " So, there are 48 4's in the units place. Wait, but let me check: 484 is the last one, so from 4 to 484, how many steps of 10? It's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Oh, I think I made a mistake earlier. It should be 49, not 48. So, 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 4's. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, except possibly the last one. Let's check: From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, the first four ranges contribute 10 each, so 4*10=40, and the last range contributes 9, so total 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's are units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 400-488, the tens place 8's are in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers. So, yes, 49 in units, 49 in tens, totaling 98. So, the difference is indeed 90. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each range contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488.

    "text": " So, there are 48 4's in the units place. Wait, but let me check: from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is actually the number of complete decades (groups of 10) times 1, plus any extra if the last number is beyond that. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me count how many such groups there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449 each contribute 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 1-488, right? Let me check: 440 is okay, and 449 is also okay because 488 is the last page. So, how many groups is that? From 40-49: 1 group, then 140-149: another, and so on up to 440-449. That's 5 groups in total. Each group contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have a 4 in numbers from 400-488. Let me see how many numbers that is. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding them up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 48 times. Wait, but 488 is included, so that's actually 49 times? Wait, no, because 488 is the last page. Let me think: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. The number of times 8 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades, which is floor(488 / 10) = 48. But wait, 488 is the 48th decade, right? So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is the 48th decade, so 48 times. So, 48 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count how many such groups there are. From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is another 10. Similarly, 280-289 and 380-389 each contribute 10. Now, 480-489 would be another group, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, so in the hundreds place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many full groups of 10 are there? Let me think: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9. So, that's 4 full groups of 10 and one partial group of 9. So, for the tens place, each full group contributes 10 8's, and the partial group contributes 9. So, 4 * 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, there are 97 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 8's in the tens place. From 80-89: 10. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. That seems correct. Units place: 48. So, total 8's: 48 + 49 = 97. For 4's: units place 48, tens place 50, hundreds place 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187-97=90. So, the answer should be 90. But wait, let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400-488, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. And for the tens place of 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, 5 groups, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct. Units place for 4's: 48 times. So, 48+50+89=187. For 8's, units place: 48, tens place: 49, so 97. So, 187-97=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the 8's in the tens place. Let me think again. When I'm counting the 8's in the tens place, I have 80-89: 10 numbers. Then 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 full groups and one partial. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 in the tens place. Units place: 48. So, total 8's: 97. Correct. So, 187-97=90. I think that's correct. So, the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   Number of 4's = 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, taking the integer part).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.  \n   Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges.  \n   Number of 4's = 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.  \n   Number of 4's = 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   Number of 8's = 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, taking the integer part).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.  \n   The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and 480-488 contributes 9.  \n   Number of 8's = (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).  \n   Number of 8's = 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **97**.\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 187 - 97 = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " So, there are 48 4's in the units place. Wait, but 484 is the 48th number, so that seems correct. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? Well, the book goes up to 488, so the last block is 440-449. Let's count the blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. How many numbers is that? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 4's. Now, adding up the 4's from each place: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. Let me calculate how many such numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, which is the first, then 18 is the second, and so on. Wait, no, actually, when you divide 488 by 10, you get 48.8, which means there are 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then an extra 8 in 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place. Alternatively, I can think of it as the number of times 8 appears in the units place is the floor division of 488 by 10, which is 48, plus 1 if the last number is 488, which it is. So, 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except possibly the last one if it doesn't go up to 489. Let's check: 480-489 would be a full block, but since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, how many full blocks are there before 480-488? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, for each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place, so 9. Therefore, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800 and 899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with an 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up the 8's from each place: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " So, there are 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, but let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. So, 48 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, etc. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let me find how many such ranges there are up to 488. The first range is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, that's correct. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, I'll do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, the last occurrence in the units place is 488. Let me calculate how many times 8 appears in the units place. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, how many full ranges are there? Let's see: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So that's 4 full ranges of 10 and one partial range of 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: Units place: 48, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. Total 187. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total 98.

The formula is to take the total number of pages, divide by 10, and take the integer part. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 times. That seems correct. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, total number of 4's is 187. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 occurrences. But wait, 488 is included, so that's correct. So, 48 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me count these. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-489, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, instead of 10, it's 9. So, that's 4 ranges with 10 each, and one range with 9. So, total in tens place is 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, total number of 8's is 97. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check my calculations. Wait, when I calculated the 4's in the tens place, I had 5 ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each contributes 10, so 5*10=50. That's correct. For 8's in the tens place, I had 4 ranges with 10 each and one with 9, totaling 49. That seems correct. Units place for both 4 and 8: 48 each. So, 4's: 48 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=187. 8's:48 (units)+49 (tens)+0=97. 187-97=90. Wait, but I'm not sure if I did the hundreds place correctly for 4's. Let me check again: from 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct. So, the difference is 187-97=90.

    "text": " So, there are 48 4's in the units place. Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so the integer part is 48. Hmm, but wait, 484 is actually the 49th occurrence because counting starts at 4 as the first. Let me check: from 4 to 484, how many numbers? The formula is ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these sets contributes 10 numbers, but I need to check if 440-449 are within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. Now, how many such sets are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first set, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets. Each set contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 sets \u00d710 = 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, and so on up to 440-449. So, 5 sets \u00d710=50. That seems correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many. The last number is 488, so (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488. So, the sets are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, let's count each set: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n3. **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n3. **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, there are 48 fours in the units place. Wait, but let me check: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so from 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is floor(488/10) = 48, since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 times. So, 48 fours in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, contributing 10 fours. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is another 10, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, total ranges: 5, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, and so on up to 440-449. So yes, 5 ranges, each with 10 fours, so 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 starting from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's printed are 187. Now, let me do the same for 8's. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor(488/10) = 48. So, 48 eights in the units place. Wait, but 488 is included, so let me check: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, how many terms? The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Wait, that's different from my initial thought. So, I think I made a mistake earlier when I said floor(488/10)=48. Actually, it's (488 - 8)/10 +1 = 49. Let me confirm: the numbers are 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these contributes 10 eights. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-489, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, instead of 10, it's 9. Therefore, the ranges for the tens place are: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So total eights in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, but let me think: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers, not 10. So, that's correct. So, 4 ranges with 10 and one with 9, totaling 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that's 98 eights. Wait, but let me check again. Units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 49 eights. So total 98 eights. Now, I thought earlier that the units place had 49, but I'm a bit confused because when I first calculated units place for 4's, I got 48, but for 8's, I got 49. Let me double-check that. For units place, 8's: starting at 8, then 18,28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So yes, 49. For tens place: as above, 49. So total 98 eights. Now, the 4's were 187, and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 187 -98=89. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Wait, 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, plus 89=187. 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. So, 89 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so 89. That seems correct. For the tens place, 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Units place: 4,14,...,484. 484 is the last one, so 484 is 484, which is 484-4=480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1? Wait, no, because 484 is the 48th term. Wait, 484 is the 48th term because 484=4 + (48-1)*10. So, 4 + 47*10=4+470=474, which is not 484. Hmm, maybe I should think differently. The number of terms where the units digit is 4 is equal to the number of complete decades. From 1 to 488, how many decades are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48. But wait, 488 is the last page, and 488 has 8 in the units place, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is within the 48th decade. So, yes, 48 fours in the units place. So, that seems correct. Now, for the tens place, 4's: 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 48+50+89=187. For 8's: units place, 49 numbers (8,18,...,488). Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9), totaling 49. Hundreds place: none, so 0. So, 49+49=98 eights. Therefore, 187-98=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's. I think that makes sense. Let me just make sure I didn't double-count or miss any ranges. For 4's in the tens place, 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is correct. For 8's in the tens place, up to 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so that's correct. Units place for 8's includes 488, so that's 49 numbers. So, yes, I think 89 is the correct difference.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: floor(488/10) = 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in pages 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9.\n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No pages have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " So, there are 48 4's in the units place. Wait, but when I think about it, 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so the integer part is 48. But wait, actually, when counting from 1 to n, the number of times a digit appears in the units place is floor(n/10) if we're looking at the digit in the units place. So, for 488, floor(488/10) is 48. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? Well, from 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's. So, 5*10=50. But wait, let me check the last range. 440-449 is 10 numbers, and 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's valid. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in the hundreds place, each of these numbers contributes a 4. So, that's 89 4's. Wait, but let me think again. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since our book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98; 98+89=187. So, total number of 4's is 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 8. So, floor(488/10)=48, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so 488 is the 49th occurrence? Wait, no, because 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. Wait, 8 is the 1st, 18 the 2nd, ..., 488 is the 49th. Because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 is included, it's 49. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think differently. The number of 8's in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus one if the last number is included. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's the same as the number of times 8 appears in the units place from 1 to 480 plus whether 488 is included. From 1 to 480, there are 480/10=48 numbers where units digit is 8 (8,18,...,478). Then, 488 is another one, so total 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But our book goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Each full range (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's count how many full ranges there are: 80-89 is the first, then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 5 ranges, but the last one is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 8's, so 4*10=40. The last range, 480-488, is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so the tens digit is 8 for all these, so that's 9 more 8's. So total in tens place: 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=187. For the 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. Difference=187-98=89. Hmm, that seems correct.

    "text": " So, there are 48 4's in the units place. Wait, but 484 is the 48th number, so that's correct. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another range, 10 numbers. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many ranges? Let's count: 40-49 (1), 140-149 (2), 240-249 (3), 340-349 (4), 440-449 (5). So, 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5*10 = 50 4's in the tens place. But wait, 440-449 is part of the 400-488 range, so it's okay. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. Each number here has 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full groups of 10, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, because from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, the count is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is within the book, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of the range. So, how many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 80-89 is one range, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, 10. From 300-399: 380-389, 10. From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8, so it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? Because 480 has 8 in the tens place, 481 has 8 in the tens, etc., up to 488. So, that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 48 such numbers.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.

    "text": " So, there are 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count these: - 40-49: that's 10 numbers. - 140-149: another 10. - 240-249: another 10. - 340-349: another 10. - 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 occurrences. Wait, but 440-449 goes up to 449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, that's 89 numbers where the hundreds digit is 4. Therefore, the number of 4's in the hundreds place is 89. Now, adding them all up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 ends with 88, but 488 is the last page. So, the last occurrence of 8 in the units place is 488. How many such numbers? Let's see: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms can be calculated as (488 - 8)/10 + 1. That's (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 8 is the first term, so 8,18,...,488. Let me check: 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count these: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, because 488-480+1=9). Wait, no, from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers. So, the first four sets are 10 each, and the last set is 9. So total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units place: 48, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total: 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems right. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total:98. 187-98=89. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"
