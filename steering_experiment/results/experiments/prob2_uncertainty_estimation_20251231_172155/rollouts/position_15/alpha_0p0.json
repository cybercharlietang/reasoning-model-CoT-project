    "text": " But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence. So, from 4 to 484, there are 48 numbers where 4 is in the units place. But wait, let me check: 4 is the first, then every 10 numbers. So, 4,14,24,...,484. To find the count, it's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. So, actually, it's 49 times. Let me verify: 4,14,24,...,484. The difference between each is 10, so the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many numbers have 4 in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-100: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. From 101-200: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. From 201-300: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. From 301-400: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. From 401-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10 numbers. So, how many blocks do we have? From 1-400, we have four blocks: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, we have another 10 numbers (440-449). So total is 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This happens in numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, we're only concerned with the hundreds digit. So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 numbers. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 can appear in the tens place. This happens in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range. Let me count each block. From 1-100: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. From 101-200: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. From 201-300: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. From 301-400: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. From 401-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the 401-488 block, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (from 1-400) and 1 block of 9 (from 401-488). So, 4*10 +9=40+9=49. Wait, but let me confirm: 1-100: 10, 101-200:10, 201-300:10, 301-400:10, 401-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds =49 +49 +0=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) -98 (number of 8's)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10th number, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block of 100 contributes 10, plus 10 in the last block, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is every 10th number, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each block of 100 contributes 10, plus 9 in the last block, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any page number since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " But wait, let me check: from 4 to 484, how many steps of 10 are there? The formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last - first)/step) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: 40-49 is the first block, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. But wait, let me check if the last block is within 488. 440-449 is definitely within 488, so yes, five blocks. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in each of these, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, but actually, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. So, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same formula: ((488 -8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check up to 488. 80-89 is the first block, then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. The next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. So, how many full blocks are there? 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's four blocks, each contributing 10 8's, so 4\u00d710=40. But wait, the last block is 480-488, which is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers). So, in the tens place, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all except 488, which is 8 in the units place. Wait, no: 480 is 4-8-0, 481 is 4-8-1, ..., 488 is 4-8-8. So, from 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers. So, that's 9 8's in the tens place for the last partial block. Therefore, total in tens place: 4 blocks \u00d710=40, plus 9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10 8's, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). The sequence from 4 to 484 has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. There are 5 such blocks, each contributing 10 4's, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). The sequence from 8 to 488 has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. There are 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and a partial block 480-488, contributing 9 8's. Total tens place 8's = 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " But wait, does 484 count? Yes, because 484 is within 488. So, there are 48 instances where 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488? Yes, so that's fine. So, 50 instances in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, in these numbers, the hundreds digit is 4, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 instances. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 ends with 8, so that's included. The first is 8, and the last is 488. To find how many, I can do 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48. But wait, does 488 count? Let's see: 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Wait, that's different from my initial thought. Let me check: the sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + 10(n-1) = 488. So, 10(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 instances in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Each block has 10 numbers except the last one, which might have fewer. Let's see: From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 +1=9 numbers. So, the first four blocks contribute 10 each, so 4*10=40, and the last block contributes 9. So total in the tens place is 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 0 instances in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 48 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Total blocks: 5 (from 0-99 to 400-488).\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears from 400 to 488.\n   - Total numbers: 89.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488.\n   - Total blocks: 5 (from 0-99 to 400-488).\n   - First four blocks: 10 each, last block: 9.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers in the 800s.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **89**\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence because starting from 4, each 10 numbers adds one. So, 48 times. But wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning there are 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place (second digit):** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place (third digit):** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens from page 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, meaning 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. Let's see how many such blocks exist. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: There's no 480-489 because the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 only in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 in the hundreds place is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many blocks? The first four blocks are complete: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: 4 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 times. Now, adding up the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, 97 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. That would be 187 (number of 4's) minus 97 (number of 8's). 187 - 97 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   Total occurrences:  \n   \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\)\n\n2. **Tens place (second digit):**  \n   The digit 4 appears in blocks of 100 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).  \n   Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).  \n   Total occurrences:  \n   \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\)\n\n3. **Hundreds place (third digit):**  \n   The digit 4 appears from page 400 to 488.  \n   Total occurrences:  \n   \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\)\n\n**Total 4's:**  \n\\( 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 \\)\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   Total occurrences:  \n   \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\)\n\n2. **Tens place (second digit):**  \n   The digit 8 appears in blocks of 100 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).  \n   There are 4 complete blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 occurrences, and an incomplete block (480-488) contributing 9 occurrences.  \n   Total occurrences:  \n   \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\)\n\n3. **Hundreds place (third digit):**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.  \n   Total occurrences:  \n   \\( 0 \\)\n\n**Total 8's:**  \n\\( 48 + 49 + 0 = 97 \\)\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = \\( 187 - 97 = 90 \\)\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence, but actually, starting from 4, each 10 numbers add one more 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, the number of 4's in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. However, 488 is included, so maybe it's 49? Wait, let me think again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each complete set of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, that's 48 sets of 10, so 48 fours. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which adds one more 4. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges exist up to 488. The first range is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Now, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. How many ranges is that? 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449: that's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: from 40-49: 10 fours in the tens place. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly up to 440-449. But 440-449 is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440 is 440, 441,...,449. So, yes, 10 numbers each. So, 5 ranges, 10 each, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. But 488 is included, so from 8 to 488, stepping by 10: 8,18,...,488. Let's see: 488 is 48*10 + 8, so that's the 49th term. Wait, because starting at 8 (1st term), then 18 is 2nd, ..., 488 is the 49th term. Wait, but 8 is the first, 18 is second, up to 488. So, how many? Let's see: 488 - 8 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, 480-488 is part of that. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers except maybe the last one. Let's check:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers)\n\nWait, 480-488: 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 ranges with 10 each (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) and one range with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me double-check: 80-89: 10 eights in the tens place. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check the tens place again. When I did the units place, I got 49 eights, and the tens place also 49, so total eights: 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, for fours, I had 188, and for eights, 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nStarting with fours:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the tens place for eights. For the tens place, I had 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. That's 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for fours in the tens place, I had 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449: 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 50 fours. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place for fours, from 400-488: that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct.\n\nFor eights in the units place, from 8,18,...,488: that's 49 numbers. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the units place for eights. Let me check again.\n\nUnits place for eights: starting at 8, then 18,28,...,488. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, last term is 488, first is 8, step is 10.\n\nSo, ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in units place. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for fours in units place: last term is 484, first term 4, step 10.\n\n((484 -4)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, 49 fours in units, 50 in tens, 89 in hundreds: total 188.\n\nEights: 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds: total 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488 inclusive. 488 -400 +1=89. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place for fours: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nIn the units place for fours: 4,14,...,484: 49 numbers. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, 188 fours and 98 eights, difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When I count the tens place for fours, I included 440-449, which is within 488. So that's correct. Similarly, for eights in the tens place, I included 480-488, which is correct.\n\nI think that's all. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range contributes 10, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and 480-488 contributes 9, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence, right? So, that's 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each set of ten numbers contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such sets are there? From 40-49 (first set), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 times. Wait, but does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 5 sets. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187 times. Okay, so there are 187 4's printed. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8 is the 1st, 18 is the 2nd, ..., 488 is the 49th. Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8. Let me think. From 8 to 488 in steps of 10, how many numbers? The formula is ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each set contributes 10 occurrences. How many sets? Let's see: 80-89 is the first, then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 sets. So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers 800-899. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. Therefore, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 89 times. So, there are 89 8's printed. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 89 (number of 8's) = 98. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For the 4's: Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, step 10. Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49? Wait, earlier I thought it was 48, but now I'm getting 49. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate. For the units place of 4's: The first is 4, and the last is 484. So, the count is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, that's 49, not 48. Similarly, for the tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, total 4's: 49+50+89=188. Wait, that's different from before. I think I initially miscalculated the units place for 4's. Similarly, for 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389. That's 4 sets, 4\u00d710=40. Hundreds place: 0. So, total 8's: 49+40=89. Now, 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. 8's:49+40=89. So, 188-89=99. Wait, now I'm getting 99. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier in the units place for 4's. Let me confirm. Units place for 4's: 4,14,24,...,484. So, starting at 4, each step is 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. So, 49+50+89=188. 8's:49+40=89. So, difference is 188-89=99. But wait, earlier I thought the answer was 98, but now it's 99. I think I need to check again. Let me list the page numbers and count manually for a smaller range to see if my method is correct. For example, let's say we have a book with page numbers up to 20. Let's count the number of 4's and 8's. Page numbers:1-20. 4's: 4,14 \u2192 2 times. 8's:8,18 \u21922 times. So, difference is 0. Using my method: Units place for 4's: 4,14 \u21922. Tens place: none, since 40-49 is beyond 20. So, total 4's:2. Units place for 8's:8,18\u21922. Tens place: none. So, total 8's:2. Difference:0. Correct. Now, let's try up to 44. 4's:4,14,24,34,44. Units:5. Tens:40-49, but 44 is included. So, 40-44:5 numbers, each with 4 in tens place. So, tens:5. Hundreds: none. Total 4's:5+5=10. 8's:8,18,28,38,48. But 48 is beyond 44, so up to 38. So, units:4 (8,18,28,38). Tens: none, since 40-49 is beyond. So, 8's:4. Difference:10-4=6. Let me count manually: 4,14,24,34,44 (5 units, 5 tens)=10. 8,18,28,38 (4). So, difference 6. Correct. So, my method works. Therefore, back to the original problem. 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. 8's:49 (units) +40 (tens)=89. Difference:188-89=99. So, there are 99 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 = 4 + (48-1)*10. Let me check: 4 + 47*10 = 4 + 470 = 474, and then the next one is 484, which is the 48th. So, there are 48 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 4's in the tens place. Let's see how many full hundreds we have. From 1-488, we have four full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, actually, 401-488 is part of the 400-499 range, but since the book ends at 488, we need to adjust. For the tens place, each hundred block contributes 10 4's. So, from 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. But wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens place can be 0-8, so from 400-488, the tens digit is 0 for 400-409, 1 for 410-419, and so on up to 8 for 480-488. So, the tens digit is 4 only once, in 440-449. So, that's another 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10 4's in the tens place. Wait, but earlier I thought from 1-400, it's 4*10=40, and then 440-449 adds another 10, making it 50. But wait, 400-488 includes 400-488, so the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's an additional 10, making the total 40 + 10 = 50. But wait, let me check again. From 1-100: 40-49 \u2192 10 4's. 101-200: 140-149 \u2192 10 4's. 201-300: 240-249 \u2192 10 4's. 301-400: 340-349 \u2192 10 4's. 401-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 4's. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but 400-488 is part of the 400-499 range, but since we're only going up to 488, the 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's 10 more. So, total 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many? The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. Wait, earlier I thought 48, but this formula gives 49. So, units place has 49 4's. Similarly, tens place: as above, 50. Hundreds place: 89. So total 49 +50 +89= 188? Wait, I'm confused now. Let me recalculate units place. The first 4 is at 4, then every 10. The last 4 in units place is 484. So, the number of terms is ((484 -4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place:49. Tens place: as above, 50. Hundreds place:89. So total 49+50+89=188 4's. Okay, now moving on to 8's. Let's do the same process. 1. **Units place:** 8,18,28,...,488. The first is 8, last is 488. Number of terms: ((488 -8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 8's in units place. 2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the tens place 8, but only up to 488. So, each hundred block contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except maybe the last one. From 1-400: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389: that's 4 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, that's 9 8's in the tens place. So total tens place 8's:40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's:0. Now, adding up all 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. So, total 4's:188, total 8's:98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check. 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89 \u2192 49+50=99 +89=188. 8's: units 49, tens 49 \u2192 98. 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. There are 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. There are 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** None, as pages go up to 488. 0 occurrences.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence, so actually, it's 48 times. But let me check: from 4 to 484, how many numbers are there? The formula is ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that's 49 times. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. So, in the units place, 4 appears 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me count how many times that happens. Each set of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-99, there are 10 (40-49). From 100-199, another 10 (140-149). Similarly, 200-299: 10 (240-249), 300-399: 10 (340-349), and 400-488: here, 440-449 is a full set of 10, but 450-488 doesn't include another 4 in the tens place. Wait, 400-488 includes 400-488, so the tens digit is 4 from 440-449. That's 10 numbers. So, total in tens place: 10 (from 1-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 50 times. Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in the hundreds place, each of these numbers has a 4, so that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these sets has 10 numbers. Let's see how many full sets there are. From 1-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189 is 10. 200-299: 280-289 is 10. 300-399: 380-389 is 10. Now, 400-488: does 480-489 fall within 488? 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, from 400-488, it's 9 numbers. So, total tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, from 1-99: 10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, and 400-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake. For the 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For the 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to 8's. \n\n1. **Counting 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " But wait, does 484 count as one? Let me check: 484 is the 48th occurrence because 48*10 = 480, but 484 is 480 + 4, so actually, it's the 49th occurrence. Hmm, I think I made a mistake here. Let me think again. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, in the last group (480-488), the units digit goes from 0 to 8, so 484 is within this group. So, in each group of 10, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, etc. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such ranges are there up to 488? Let's see: The first range is 40-49 (10 numbers), the next is 140-149 (another 10), then 240-249, 340-349, and finally 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, but 540-549 would be beyond 488, so we don't include that. So, how many ranges is that? From 40-49 up to 440-449, that's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5*10 = 50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is fully included. Since the book goes up to 488, 449 is included, so yes, that's correct. So, 5 ranges, each with 10 4's, so 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Let's count the number of 8's in each digit position. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so does that mean there are 49 occurrences? Let me think: the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each 10 numbers, there's one 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But in the last partial group (480-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included, which is another 8. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 488 is the 489th number? No, wait, 488 is the 488th page. So, the units digit 8 occurs in 8, 18, ..., 488. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? It's an arithmetic sequence starting at 8, ending at 488, with a common difference of 10. The nth term is given by a_n = 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, 8 + 10(n-1) = 488 => 10(n-1) = 480 => n-1 = 48 => n=49. So, there are 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only part of the range, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, let's break it down: a. 80-89: 10 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. b. 180-189: another 10. c. 280-289: another 10. d. 380-389: another 10. e. 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 4*10=40, and 480-488 contributes 9. So, total 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, yes, 9. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " But wait, does 484 count? Yes, because 484 is less than or equal to 488. So, there are 48 numbers where 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers. Let's count them: - 40-49: 10 numbers - 140-149: 10 numbers - 240-249: 10 numbers - 340-349: 10 numbers - 440-449: 10 numbers. So, that's 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 numbers. But wait, the last block is 440-449, which is within 488, so all 5 blocks are valid. So, 50 numbers where 4 is in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But I'm only interested in how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place, which is once per number. So, that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding them up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, the digit 4 appears 187 times. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48 numbers. But wait, 488 is included, so actually, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one. Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 numbers where 8 is in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. Let's count: - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189: 10 numbers - 280-289: 10 numbers - 380-389: 10 numbers. That's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 numbers. But wait, 480-489 would be another block, but since the book ends at 488, the 480-489 block only goes up to 488. So, in the tens place, 8 appears in 480-488 as well. So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, for the tens place, it's 4 blocks of 10 (40) plus 9 more, totaling 49 numbers. Wait, no. Actually, when considering the tens place, each block is 100 numbers. So, 80-89 is in the 80-89 range, which is within 1-99, so that's valid. Similarly, 180-189 is within 100-199, etc. But for the hundreds place, 400-488, the tens digit can be 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the total for the tens place is 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check. For the units place, I had 49, and for the tens place, I had 49, so total 98. But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place. Let me recount. The tens digit is 8 in the following ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, and the last one has 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, that's 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49 numbers where 8 is in the tens place. So, that part is correct. Therefore, total 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the number of 4's was 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units place: 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Wait, earlier I thought it was 48, but now I'm getting 49. Hmm, maybe I was wrong before. Let me clarify. The units digit 4 occurs at 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is calculated by ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place for 4 is 49, not 48 as I initially thought. Similarly, for the tens place, 40-49,140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50. And hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, total 4's: 49 +50 +89= 188. Wait, I thought earlier it was 187, but now it's 188. Hmm, I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate. Units place: 4,14,...,484: 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49 (10),140-149(10),240-249(10),340-349(10),440-449(10). That's 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. So, 4's appear 188 times. Now for 8's: units place:8,18,...,488. Number of terms: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Tens place:80-89 (10),180-189(10),280-289(10),380-389(10),480-488(9). So, 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, totaling 49. So, 49 units +49 tens=98. So, 8's appear 98 times. Therefore, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, earlier I thought 89, but now it's 90. So, I must have miscalculated earlier. Let me confirm. 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the correct answer is 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, I think I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check: from 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89 numbers. Each of these has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 occurrences. So, that's correct. And for the tens place, 40-49 is 10 numbers, same for each subsequent block. So, 5 blocks \u00d710=50. Units place:49. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's, units place:49, tens place:49, so total 98. So, difference is 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   Number of terms:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = \\frac{480}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.  \n   Each block has 10 numbers, so:  \n   \\[\n   5 \\text{ blocks} \\times 10 = 50\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488.  \n   Number of terms:  \n   \\[\n   488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n   \\]\n   \nTotal 4's:  \n\\[\n49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   Number of terms:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = \\frac{480}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.  \n   Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, and the last block has 9 numbers:  \n   \\[\n   4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's:  \n\\[\n49 + 49 = 98\n\\]\n\n**Difference:**  \n\\[\n188 - 98 = 90\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " But wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is 48*10 + 4. So, that's 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, but 488's units digit is 8, so it doesn't affect the 4 count. So, 48 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 would be within 488, so that's valid. Let me count how many such blocks there are. Each block is 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many blocks are there? From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in 1-99, there's one block (40-49), which is 10 numbers. Then in 100-199, another block (140-149), another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, another 10. 300-399: 340-349, another 10. 400-488: 440-449, another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that is. The last occurrence is at 488, which is 8 in the units place. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of such numbers is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. Wait, but 488 is included, so let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, but since 488 is the 49th occurrence. Hmm, let me think differently. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? It's the same as floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 is included, it's 49. Wait, because 8,18,...,488: that's 49 numbers. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such blocks there are. Each block is 10 numbers, contributing 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. How many blocks are there? From 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in 1-99: 80-89, 10 numbers. 100-199:180-189, 10. 200-299:280-289, 10. 300-399:380-389, 10. 400-488: does 480-489 exist? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range. So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). Wait, that's only 9 numbers, not 10. So, in the hundreds place, the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times in the tens place here.\n\nSo, for the tens place, we have:\n\n- 1-99: 10\n- 100-199:10\n- 200-299:10\n- 300-399:10\n- 400-488:9\n\nTotal in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0=98.\n\nWait, let me double-check the tens place for 400-488. The tens digit is 8 from 480 to 488. Let me count how many numbers that is: 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, adding up: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nWait, but earlier for 4's, I had 187, and for 8's, 98. So, the difference would be 187 - 98=89.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place for 4's again. From 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The sequence is 4 +10*(n-1)=484. So, 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there.\n\nWait, let me think: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, that's 49 times in the units place. But earlier, I thought it was 48. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, in the 4's count, I initially thought 48 in units place, but now I'm seeing it's 49. Let me check: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? Let's see: 4 is the first, then 14,24,...,484. The last term is 484, which is 4 + 10*(n-1)=484, so 10*(n-1)=480, n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 48, but actually it's 49. So, that changes the total count for 4's.\n\nSo, let's recalculate the number of 4's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50 (from earlier)\n- Hundreds place:89\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units was 48, but it's actually 49. So, total 4's is 188, not 187.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, let's check:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\n\nTotal 8's:98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 187, but now it's 188. Let me confirm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units place for 4's. Let me list some numbers:\n\n4,14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94,104,114,...,484.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Let's see, 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place, it's 49 as well.\n\nWait, so 4's in units place:49, tens place:50, hundreds place:89. So, total 4's=49+50+89=188.\n\n8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98.\n\nDifference=188-98=90.\n\nWait, so the initial count for 4's was wrong because I thought units place was 48, but it's actually 49. So, the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure about the tens place for 4's. I had 5 blocks: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That seems correct.\n\nAnd hundreds place:400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:49\n\nHundreds:0\n\nTotal=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 187, but now it's 188. So, the correct answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the 8's in the tens place again. From 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any other mistakes. Let me recount the 4's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\n8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo solve this, we count the occurrences of '4' and '8' in each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\n**Counting '4's:**\n1. **Units place:** '4' appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** '4' appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** '4' appears in pages 400-488, resulting in 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal '4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting '8's:**\n1. **Units place:** '8' appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** '8' appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** '8' does not appear in any page number as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal '8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " But wait, starting from 4, the next is 14, which is 10 more, so each step is 10. So, the number of 4's in the units place would be 48. Let me check: from 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, so maybe it's 49 times. Wait, because 484 is the last one, so 4,14,...,484. Let me calculate it as (484 - 4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many hundreds are there? The book goes up to 488, so we have hundreds 0-4 (since 400-488 is included). Wait, let's see: from 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, that's 5 hundred blocks. In each, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks * 10 numbers = 50. But wait, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, right? So, that's 10. So, total 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, the last block is 400-488. Does that include 440-449? Yes, so 10 numbers. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Wait, but I'm only considering the hundreds digit here, so each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many? (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 =48 +1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-488. Let me check how many hundreds blocks we have. Again, 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. In each hundred block, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers, except possibly the last block. Let's see: in 0-99, 80-89: 10 numbers. In 100-199, 180-189: 10 numbers. Similarly, 200-299: 280-289: 10. 300-399: 380-389: 10. Now, 400-488: the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 numbers, not 10. So, in the hundreds block 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks with 10 each (from 0-399) and 1 block with 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is 800 or above, which doesn't happen here. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)= 49+49=98. So, total 8's:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's.

    "text": " But wait, let me check: from 4 to 484, how many steps of 10 are there? The formula is (last - first) / step + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 480/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, so actually, there are 49 occurrences in the units place. Wait, but 484 is the last one, which is 484 - 4 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 gives 49. Okay, so 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me count how many sets of ten there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, etc.) has another 10 numbers. So, 40-49 is in the first hundred, 140-149 in the second, 240-249 in the third, 340-349 in the fourth, and 440-449 in the fifth hundred. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, but 540-549 would be beyond. So, how many sets? Let's see: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets. Each set has 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive. Let's calculate that: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many. The last occurrence is 488. Using the formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 480/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Let's count how many sets. 80-89: 10 numbers. Then each hundred block has another 10. So, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, let's calculate each set: 80-89: 10. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9. So total is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   Number of blocks: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).  \n   Each block has 10 numbers, so total occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   5 \\times 10 = 50\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in numbers 400-488.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n   \\]\n\n**Total 4's:**  \n\\[\n49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   Each block except the last has 10 numbers; the last block (480-488) has 9.  \n   Number of blocks: 5 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488).  \n   Total occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   No page numbers in the book have an 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:**  \n\\[\n49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\\]\n\n**Difference:**  \n\\[\n188 - 98 = 90\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " But wait, starting from 4, the sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. Let me check: the number of terms in this sequence is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. The blocks are: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences, so 5 * 10 = 50 occurrences. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so all these blocks are within the range. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, let me add up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, I need to count the number of 8's. Let's do the same process for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 480/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 occurrences. Let's count the blocks. 80-89 is one block (10 numbers), 180-189 is another (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's 4 blocks, so 4 * 10 = 40 occurrences. Wait, but 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but since the book only goes up to 488, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, the 8 can appear in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, actually, the tens place has 4 blocks of 10 and 1 partial block of 9. Wait, no, because 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, but in the tens place, 8 can appear in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 9 numbers. So, how does this affect the count? Let me think. Normally, each block is 10 numbers, but in the case of 480-488, it's only 9. So, for the tens place, the full blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, the last partial block is 480-488, which contributes 9 occurrences (480, 481, ..., 488). So, total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but earlier I thought of 4 blocks, but actually, 480-488 is another block, making it 5 blocks? No, because 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, but in terms of the tens digit, 8 can only be in 480-489, which is 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9. So, the tens place has 4 full blocks (each 10) and 1 partial block (9). So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only has 488 pages, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract 98 from 188: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: units (49), tens (50), hundreds (89). 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units (49), tens (49), hundreds (0). 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 8's. Let me verify. For the tens place, 80-89: 10 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 40. Then, 480-488: 9 numbers. So, 40 +9=49. That seems right. So, total 8's are 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct because 488-400+1=89. So, 89 is correct. So, yes, 188 fours and 98 eights, so 90 more fours. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488. This range includes 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

This gives 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence, right? So, that's 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many complete blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one block. 100-199: 140-149 is another. 200-299: 240-249. 300-399: 340-349. 400-488: 440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, in the 400-488 range, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also be in the hundreds place, which is in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers are there here? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, it's 488, so the units digit is 8. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. To find the count, I can do (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me check if 480-489 is within the book's pages. The book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. So, how many blocks? 0-99: 80-89 is one block. 100-199: 180-189. 200-299: 280-289. 300-399: 380-389. 400-488: 480-488. So that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers, except the last one, which goes from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, the first four blocks each have 10 numbers, and the last block has 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can only be 4 in the range 400-488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contribution is 0. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, ..., 484.

The number of terms can be calculated by (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the counts for each place: Units: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. Total number of 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me find how many such numbers. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same method: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range. Let me check each range: - 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. - 100-199: 180-189 is 10. - 200-299: 280-289 is 10. - 300-399: 380-389 is 10. - 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, how many ranges? The first four ranges (80-89, etc.) each have 10, and the last one has 9. So total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the counts for 8: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total number of 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.

    "text": " But wait, does 484 count? Yes, because 484 is within 488. So, that's 48 times. But let me check: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10 each time. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Oh, I see, I missed that. So actually, it's 49 times. Hmm, that's a mistake. I need to be careful with the formula. The formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last - first)/step) + 1. So, yes, 49 times for the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 here. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. The count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many there are. The first occurrence is at 8, the last is at 488. Using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's check each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: Here, the tens digit is 8, and the units digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can only be 0-4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights.

    "text": " But wait, does 484 count as one? Let me check: 484 is indeed within the range, so the count should be 49 because it starts at 4 (which is the 1st occurrence) and ends at 484 (which is the 49th occurrence). Wait, maybe I should think differently. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? The first is 4, then every 10 numbers. So, the number of times is floor(488 / 10) = 48 times. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. But does 484 count as one? Yes, because 484 is less than 488. So, 48 times. But wait, when I count from 4 to 484, how many numbers is that? Let me think: The first number is 4, which is 4 + (n-1)*10 <= 488. So, 4 + (n-1)*10 <= 488 => (n-1)*10 <= 484 => n-1 <= 48.4 => n <= 49.4, so n=49. So, there are 49 numbers where the units digit is 4. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think of it another way. For each group of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the units digit cycles from 0-9. So in each group, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. How many such groups are there from 1 to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups and a partial group of 8 numbers (481-488). In each full group, there's one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the partial group (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so no 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's: 48. Now, moving on to the tens place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many times this happens. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers long, so each contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers) From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers) From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers) From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers) Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, each of these contributes 10, so 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, that's fine. So, total tens place 4's: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 +89=187. So, total number of 4's is 187. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the digit 8 appears every 10 numbers. The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? Let's see: The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, the count is floor(488 /10)=48.8, so 48 times. But wait, let me check: starting at 8, each 10 numbers. The number of times is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Wait, that's different from before. Let me clarify: The formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last term - first term)/common difference) +1. So, first term is 8, last term is 488, common difference is 10. So, ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place 8's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count these. Each range is 10 numbers. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers) From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers) From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers) From 400-488: Now, does 480-489 exist? 480-489 would be the next range, but since the book only goes up to 488, the tens digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 480-488. So, that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8, so 480-489 would have the tens digit 8, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, we have four full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, and one partial range (480-488) contributing 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4\u00d710 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=187. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. Difference=187-98=89. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the units place for 4's, I thought maybe it's 48 or 49. Let me check that again. Units place for 4's: from 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The last term is 484. Using the formula: ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place for 4's is 49, not 48. Oh, I think I made a mistake earlier. So, units place for 4's is 49, not 48. Similarly, units place for 8's is 49. So, correcting that: 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=49+50=99+89=188. 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. So, difference=188-98=90. Wait, that's different. Let me go through this again carefully. Let's recount the number of 4's in each place: **Units place for 4's:** The numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. The last term is 484. So, number of terms: ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. **Tens place for 4's:** As before, 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. **Hundreds place for 4's:** 400-488: 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89. Total 4's: 49+50+89=188. Now, for 8's: **Units place for 8's:** 8,18,28,...,488. The last term is 488. So, number of terms: ((488 -8)/10)+1=(480/10)+1=48+1=49. **Tens place for 8's:** 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four contributes 10, the last contributes 9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, 4\u00d710 +9=49. **Hundreds place for 8's:** 0, since we don't reach 800. Total 8's:49+49=98. So, difference is 188-98=90. Wait, so earlier I thought it was 89, but after correcting the units place for 4's, it's 90. Let me make sure I didn't make any other mistakes. Units place for 4's:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 4's:188. Units place for 8's:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 8's:98. Difference:188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** Numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence, right? Because 484 is 48*10 + 4, so that's correct. So, 48 times the 4 appears in the units place. But wait, does 484 count? Let me check: 484 is within 488, so yes, it does count. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This would be from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Wait, but in these numbers, the hundreds digit is 4, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Wait, but let me check: from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. Let me calculate how many numbers: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 48*10=480, so the 48th occurrence would be at 480 +8=488. So, 48 times. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the last block. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except maybe the last one. Let's see: From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 +1 =9 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the last block contributes 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49 times. Wait, but I need to make sure that 480-488 is indeed part of the tens place being 8. Yes, because in 480, the tens digit is 8, same with 481, etc., up to 488. So, that's correct. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48+49=97. So, 97 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: \\( \\lfloor \\frac{484}{10} \\rfloor = 48 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total occurrences: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears from 400 to 488.\n   - Total numbers: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: \\( \\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\rfloor = 48 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - First four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers in the 800s.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 48 + 49 + 0 = 97 \\).\n\n**Difference:** \\( 187 - 97 = 90 \\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 is 48*10 + 4. So, there are 48 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Let's count them: - 40-49: 10 numbers - 140-149: 10 numbers - 240-249: 10 numbers - 340-349: 10 numbers - 440-449: 10 numbers But wait, the book only goes up to 488. So, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's. Now, adding them up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is 488, which is 488/10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups of 10, meaning 48 8's. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 is 48*10 + 8, so actually, there are 49 8's in the units place. Wait, no, let me think again. The first 8 is at 8, then every 10 after that. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? Let's calculate: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers with an 8 in the tens place. Let's count them: - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189: 10 numbers - 280-289: 10 numbers - 380-389: 10 numbers Now, 488 is less than 490, so 480-489 would be the next block, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 in 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, actually, the tens digit in 480-488 is 8, so that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, for the tens place, we have four blocks: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, total 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 8's in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Wait, but earlier I thought units place had 49 and tens place had 49, so total 98 8's. Now, comparing to the number of 4's, which was 187, so the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems. Let me recount the 4's: Units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many? (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Wait, earlier I said 48, but this calculation says 49. Wait, so maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate: The units place 4's: starts at 4, ends at 484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 4's, not 48. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. So, units place: 49 4's. Tens place: 5 blocks (40-49,140-149,...,440-449), each 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So total 49+50+89= 49+50=99; 99+89=188. So, 188 4's. Now, for 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. Number of terms: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189(10),280-289(10),380-389(10), and 480-488(9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Hundreds place: 0. So total 49+49=98 8's. So, the difference is 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. Wait, so earlier I thought 187-98=89, but after correcting the units place for 4's, it's 188-98=90. Hmm, so I think the correct difference is 90 more 4's than 8's. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For 4's: Units:49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 49+50=99; 99+89=188. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

    "text": " But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence, so that's correct. However, I should check if 488 is included. Since 488 is beyond 484, the units place 4's go up to 484, which is 48 times. Wait, but let me think again. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, meaning 48 times. But wait, in the 480-488 range, the units digit 4 occurs once at 484. So, yes, 48 times in total. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Wait, but each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times. So, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 times. Now, I need to count the number of 8's. Let's go through the same process. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, meaning 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence? Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10, but since we're counting the units digit, it's 8 in 8,18,...,488. So, how many numbers? Let's calculate: the number of 8's in the units place is equal to the number of times 8 appears in the units digit from 1 to 488. So, starting at 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is given by the formula: number of terms = ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. Here, first term is 8, last term is 488, common difference is 10. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would be another block, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488, which is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many full blocks are there? The first block is 80-89 (10 numbers), then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each with 10 numbers, contributing 4\u00d710=40 times. Then, the last partial block is 480-488, which has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only has 488 pages, there are no page numbers in the hundreds place with 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0. Adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times. Now, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times (from 4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times (5 blocks \u00d7 10 numbers).\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (from 8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with an additional 9 in 480-488, totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book only goes up to 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 = 4 + (48-1)*10 = 4 + 470 = 474. Wait, that doesn't add up. Let me correct that. Actually, the number of times a digit appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and taking the integer part. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the 48th group ends at 480, and then we have 481-488. So, in the units place, from 1 to 488, how many 4's? Let's see: from 1-480, every 10 numbers has one 4 in the units place. So, 480 / 10 = 48. Then, from 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so no 4 in the units place. So, total 4's in units place: 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which is the second digit. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's figure out how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. The next is 140-149, then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many blocks? From 0 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, there's one block of 10 where the tens digit is 4. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. But wait, we also have the 440-449 block in the 400-488 range. So, that's another 10. So, total 40 + 10 = 50? Wait, no, because 400-488 includes 440-449, which is part of the 400-499 range, but since our book ends at 488, does 440-449 still count? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, actually, in each hundred, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times. So, 4 full hundreds (1-400) would give 4*10=40, and then in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is another 10, so total 50. Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so the 440-449 is within that. So, yes, 50 in total. Wait, but let me check: from 1-400, the tens digit 4 occurs 40 times. Then from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total 40 +10=50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place, which is the third digit. This happens in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but the hundreds digit is only 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, let's sum up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll go through the same process: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is at 488. So, how many such numbers? From 1-488, every 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. So, 48 8's in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does that count? Yes, because 488 is included. So, 488 is the 48th group's last number. Wait, let me check: 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. Wait, that's different. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, how many numbers? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, (488 -8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. Hmm, so I think my initial thought was wrong. It's 49, not 48. Because 488 is included, so it's the 49th occurrence. Let me confirm: 8 is the first, 18 the second, ..., 488 is the 49th. Yes, because 488 =8 + (49-1)*10=8+480=488. So, 49 8's in units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 can appear in the tens place, which is the second digit. For example, 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Each block contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except possibly the last one if it's cut short. Let's calculate how many full blocks there are. Each hundred has one block where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 101-200: 180-189 (10). From 201-300: 280-289 (10). From 301-400: 380-389 (10). From 401-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so only 9 8's in the tens place there. So, total tens place 8's: 4 full blocks (each 10) and 1 partial block (9). So, 4*10 +9=40 +9=49. Wait, but let me check: from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place, which is the third digit. This happens in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, sum up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total 8's:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) -98 (8's)=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " But wait, does 484 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me check: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The number of terms can be calculated as ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there in 488 pages? The last range would be 440-449, and then we have 450-488. So, let's count the ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. Each number here has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, there are 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same method as before: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's check if there's a 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, the last range would be 380-389. So, how many such ranges are there? 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's 4 ranges. Each has 10 8's, so 4 * 10 = 40 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book has only 488 pages, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, there are 89 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 89 = 99.

    "text": " But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence, so actually, it's 48 + 1 = 49 times? Wait, no, because from 4 to 484, each 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place. So, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, but since 484 is included, we have 48 full sets of 10 (40 numbers each) plus the 4 in 484. Wait, maybe a better way is to calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. The pattern repeats every 10 numbers, with exactly one 4 in the units place each time. So, total number of 4's in units place = floor(488 / 10) = 48, but since 488 ends with 8, the last complete set is 480-488, which includes 484, so actually, it's 49 times? Wait, let me check. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is (488 // 10) + 1 if the last digit is >=4. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. Then, since the last number is 488, which is 8 in the units place, so the 48th set ends at 480, and 481-488 includes 484, which is another 4. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 488 is 488, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's think differently: for each ten numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of ten, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, we have 484, which is another 4. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, so 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which is the second digit. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges exist up to 488. The first is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is fully included. Since the book goes up to 488, yes, 449 is less than 488, so all 10 numbers are included. So, 5 ranges * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place, which is the third digit. This happens from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in each of these, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's printed: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's in units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's calculate how many times. From 1 to 488, each 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. But since 488 ends with 8, that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, let's think: from 1 to 480, that's 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, 481-488 includes 488, which is another 8. So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many full ranges there are. The first is 80-89 (10 numbers), then 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. Now, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, for the tens place, each full range contributes 10 8's, and the last one contributes 9. So, how many full ranges? 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each with 10 8's, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, the last range, 480-488, contributes 9 8's in the tens place (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place). So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers.

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 4 as the first. Let me check: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set would be 440-449. Let me count how many sets there are. Each set has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. The first set is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 here. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is included. Let me calculate how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me see if 480-489 is included. Wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the page numbers. So, how many sets? 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers because 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 -480 +1=9. So, the first four sets each have 10 numbers, and the last set has 9. So total in the tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) -98 (number of 8's)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " But wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? It's every 10 numbers, so the count should be floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, it's 48 full cycles, but does 484 count as the 48th? Let me see: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. So, 484 is the 48th occurrence because (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that's 49 times. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. The formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is floor(n/10) + 1 if the units digit of n is >= d. Wait, no, actually, it's a bit more precise. The number of times a digit appears in the units place up to n is equal to the number of complete decades (10s) plus one if the units digit is >= the digit. So, for 488, the units digit is 8. Since 8 >= 4, the number of 4's in the units place is floor(488/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but let me test with a smaller number. Let's say n=14. The number of 4's in the units place from 1 to 14 is 2: 4 and 14. Using the formula, floor(14/10)=1, and since 14's units digit is 4 >=4, so 1 +1=2. That works. So, applying that, for 488, units place 4's: 48 +1=49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same formula: floor(488/10)=48, and since the units digit is 8 >=8, so 48 +1=49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's check each range: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is calculated as floor(488/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.

Oh, I see, I should add 1 because both the starting and ending points are included. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me count how many sets of ten there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, each hundred has another 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many hundreds are there? The book goes up to 488, so the hundreds digits are 1, 2, 3, and 4. For each of these, there's a set where the tens digit is 4. So, for 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). For 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). For 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). For 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). So that's 4 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 40 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 40 occurrences. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 40 = 89; 89 + 89 = 178. So, there are 178 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's calculate how many times this happens. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many sets there are. From 1-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). Now, 400-488: does 480-489 fall within 488? Yes, because 489 is beyond 488, so only up to 488. So, 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the hundreds place 4, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, the number of 8's is: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 from 480-488. That's 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total eights are units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 178, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 178 - 98 = 80. So, there are 80 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4 to 484, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 40 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 40 + 89 = 178.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8 to 488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with an additional 9 in 480-488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 178 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 80.\n\n$\\boxed{80}$"

Each set has exactly one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so no additional 4 in the units place. So, total 4's in the units place: 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. Therefore, total 4's in the hundreds place: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 fours in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many times. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but we take the integer part, so 48. But wait, 488 is the 48th occurrence? Let me check: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, from 1 to 480, that's 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digit is 8 at 488, so that's one more. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10 = 40. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, there are 89 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 187 (number of 4's) - 89 (number of 8's) = 98. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For the 4's: units: 48, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. That seems correct. For the 8's: units: 49, tens: 40, hundreds: 0. 49 + 40 = 89. So, 187 - 89 = 98. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 4's. Let me check again. The tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 is correct. Similarly, for 8's, the tens digit is 8 in four ranges, so 40 is correct. So, 187 - 89 = 98. But wait, the problem says \"how many more 4's than 8's,\" so the answer should be 98. But let me think again: did I count correctly? For units place of 4: from 4,14,...484. 484 is 48*10 + 4, so 48 times. Correct. For tens place of 4: five ranges, each 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. For hundreds place of 4: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. For units place of 8: from 8,18,...488. 488 is the 49th occurrence. Correct. For tens place of 8: four ranges, 40 numbers. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, total 4's: 187, 8's: 89. 187 - 89 = 98. Hmm, but I think I might have miscounted the hundreds place for 4's. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, but does that include 400? Let me check: 488 - 400 +1 = 89. Yes, correct. So, 89 is correct. So, the difference is 98. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because I recall sometimes when counting digits, especially in higher places, you have to be careful about the exact range. Let me verify the 4's in the hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's there. That's correct. For the 8's, the hundreds place never occurs because the book only has 488 pages, so 800-899 isn't included. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. So, 89 8's total. So, 187 - 89 = 98. Therefore, there are 98 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 48 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449, totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).

    "text": " But wait, does 484 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me check: from 4 to 484, each 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place. So, 484 is the 49th number because 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, but since we start counting from 4 (which is the 1st), each subsequent 10 adds one more. So, actually, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The numbers with 4 in the units place are 4,14,24,...,484. The total count can be calculated by (484 - 4)/10 + 1. That is (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5*10 = 50 occurrences. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89= 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's calculate how many. The first is 8, and the last is 488. Using the same formula: (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these contributes 10 numbers. How many such ranges are there? 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 ranges, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. But wait, 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but since the book only goes up to 488, the range 480-488 has 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place occurrences: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) -98 (number of 8's) =90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check the tens place for 8 again. I had 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This gives 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. This gives 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488. This gives 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This gives 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This gives 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence, right? Let me check: from 4 to 484, each 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place. So, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, which means 48 full sets of 10, so 48 times. But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence because 4 is the first, then 14 is the second, and so on up to 484, which would be the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me think again. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4. So, 48 times in the units place. But wait, the last page is 488, so the units digit is 8, so the last 4 in the units place is 484. So, from 4 to 484, that's 484 - 4 / 10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 +1 = 49? Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me use a formula: the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is floor((n)/10). So, for 488, floor(488/10) = 48. So, 48 times. So, units place: 48 fours. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 fours in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in 488, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 480-488. In each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49). So, 4 hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40 fours. Now, check the partial hundred: 480-488. The tens digit here is 8, so the tens place doesn't have a 4 in this range. So, total fours in the tens place: 40. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, total fours: 48 (units) + 40 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 48 + 40 = 88 + 89 = 177 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? Using the same formula: floor(488/10) = 48. But wait, 488 is included, so from 8 to 488, how many? Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The last term is 488, which is 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. Solving for n: (488 - 8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48, but maybe that's different because 488 is included. Let me check: floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 ends with 8, it's an extra one. So, 48 +1 = 49? Wait, no, the formula floor(n/10) gives the number of times the digit appears in the units place. So, for 488, floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 itself has an 8 in the units place, it's actually 48 +1 = 49. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because in the units place, from 1 to 488, the number of 8's is 49. Let me confirm: For example, from 1 to 10, there's one 8. From 1 to 20, two 8's, etc. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, plus the 8 in 488, so total 49. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Each full block (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 eights in the tens place. How many full blocks are there? From 0-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Now, the partial block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). The tens digit here is 8, so that's 9 more eights in the tens place. So, total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 49 is 98, but let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds: 0. So, total eights: 98. Wait, but earlier when counting fours, we had 177 fours. So, the difference would be 177 - 98 = 79. But wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. First, fours: units 48, tens 40, hundreds 89, total 177. Eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98. So, 177 - 98 = 79. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the counts. Let me verify each part again.\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Units place: from 4,14,24,...484. How many terms? The last term is 484, which is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Wait, so earlier I thought it was 48, but actually it's 49. Because 484 is included, so it's 49 fours in the units place. Similarly, for tens place: in each hundred, 40-49, etc., so 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Plus, in the last partial hundred, 480-488, the tens digit is 8, so no fours. So, tens place: 40 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 40 + 89 = 178. Wait, that's different from before. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recast.\n\nWait, when counting units place for fours, I think I initially got 48, but upon re-examining, it's 49. Because from 4 to 484, the number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place: 49 fours.\n\nSimilarly, for eights:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, (488 -8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place: 49 eights.\n\nTens place for eights: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-488. Each full block (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 eights, so 4 blocks give 40. The last block, 480-488, is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, tens place: 40 +9=49 eights.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98.\n\nTotal fours: 49 (units) +40 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =178.\n\nSo, the difference is 178 fours -98 eights =80.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 79, but after correcting the units place for fours, it's 49 instead of 48, so total fours is 178, and eights are 98, so 178-98=80.\n\nWait, but let me confirm again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach.\n\nFor each digit position, count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- For fours: numbers ending with 4 from 4 to 484. As calculated, 49 times.\n- For eights: numbers ending with 8 from 8 to 488. As calculated, 49 times.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For fours: in each hundred, 40-49, so 10 numbers. There are 4 full hundreds (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. The last hundred is 400-488, but the tens digit in 400-488 is 0-8, so no additional fours in the tens place. So, tens place for fours:40.\n\n- For eights: in each hundred, 80-89, so 10 numbers. There are 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. The last hundred is 400-488, and in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, tens place for eights:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- For fours: numbers from 400-488. That's 488-400+1=89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n- For eights: numbers from 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are no eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total fours: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 49+40=89+89=178.\n\nTotal eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nDifference: 178 -98=80.\n\nSo, the answer should be 80 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 178, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 80.\n\n$\\boxed{80}$"

    "text": " But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence because starting from 4, each 10 numbers add one more. Wait, actually, 484 is 48*10 + 4, so that's 49th occurrence? Hmm, maybe I should think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488 is calculated by considering how many complete groups of 10 there are and then seeing how many are left. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then in the incomplete group (481-488), there's a 4 at 484. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there? From 0-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check the last range. 440-449 is 10 numbers, and since 449 is less than 488, it's all valid. So, 50 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, only the hundreds digit is 4. So, each of these numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, so that's correct. So, hundreds place 4's: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's printed: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with 8. So, how many such numbers? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then the incomplete group has 488, which is another 8. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last range. So, how many ranges? 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 ranges. Each full range (like 80-89) contributes 10 numbers, but the last range (480-488) is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, total tens place 8's: 4 ranges * 10 = 40, plus 9 from the last range. So, 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups of 10, contributing 48 fours, plus an additional 4 at 484, totaling 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges, each contributing 10 fours, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in all numbers from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers.

    "text": " But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence, right? Because 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so yes, 48 times. But wait, let me check: starting from 4, every 10 numbers adds another 4 in the units place. So from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's the same as the number of complete decades. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, meaning 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit goes up to 8, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is indeed the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers long. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 400-488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? The last occurrence is at 488, which is the units digit. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, meaning 48 times. But wait, 488 is the 48th occurrence because 488 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 8. So, units place: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? So let's count each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total in tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, total 8's: 97. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 187 - 97 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Checking 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. For 8's: units 48, tens 49, hundreds 0. 48+49=97. So, 187-97=90. Hmm, okay, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. When I considered 480-488, I counted 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. But wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), and in each of these, the tens digit is 8. So that's correct, 9 numbers. So, 4 ranges of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) and one range of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That's correct. So, 48 in units, 49 in tens, total 97. For 4's, the hundreds place is from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. That's correct. So, 187-97=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).

    "text": " Wait, but let me check: from 4 to 484, that's every 10 numbers, so that's 48 times, right? Hmm, but wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 is 48*10 + 4, so yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in 1-99, there's 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then in 100-199, 140-149 is another 10. Similarly, 240-249 is another 10, 340-349 is another 10, and 440-449 is another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 sets of 10 numbers each, so 5*10 = 50 times. Wait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is 10, 240-249 is 10, 340-349 is 10, and 440-449 is 10. That's 5 sets, so 50 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? Well, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times. Wait, but let me confirm: from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up the 4's: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, which is 48*10 + 8. So, 488 is the 48th occurrence. Wait, but let me check: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, that's 48 numbers. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in 1-99, 80-89 is 10 numbers. In 100-199, 180-189 is another 10. Similarly, 280-289 is another 10, 380-389 is another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, that's 9 numbers, not 10. So, let me recalculate: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so yes, 49 in total. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the 8's: units place (48) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, 97 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units place 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units 48, tens 49, hundreds 0. 48+49=97. 187-97=90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the tens place for 8's again. I thought 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 480,481,...,488. Let me count: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, 480-488: 9, yes. So, 49 in total for the tens place. So, 48 (units) +49 (tens) =97. For 4's, hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct. So, 89. So, 48+50+89=187. So, 187-97=90. So, the answer should be 90. Wait, but let me think again: when counting the units place for 4's, from 4 to 484, that's every 10 numbers, so 48 times. Similarly, for 8's, units place is 8 to 488, which is also 48 times. That makes sense. Tens place for 4's: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 times. For 8's, tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last one is only 9 numbers, so 49 times. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times for 4's, and 0 for 8's. So, 4's total: 48+50+89=187. 8's total:48+49+0=97. Difference:187-97=90. So, the answer is 90. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - There are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Each range has 10 numbers, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - There are 5 such ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488).\n   - The first four ranges have 10 numbers each, and the last range (480-488) has 9 numbers.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in any hundreds place within 1-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **97**.\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence, so actually, it's 48 times. But wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? It's 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Oh, I see, I made a mistake earlier. It's actually 49 times. So, 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Now, let's see how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, total in tens place is 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, total 4's = units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, let me add that again: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, so let's see: From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the hundreds place, the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4 ranges of 10 each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and 9 numbers in 480-488. So, 4\u00d710 +9=40+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total 8's = units + tens + hundreds = 49 +49 +0=98.

    "text": " But wait, does 484 count? Yes, because 484 is less than 488. So, 48 times. But wait, let me check: from 4 to 484, how many numbers? The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Oh, I think I made a mistake earlier by taking the integer part. So, actually, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, 484 is the last one with 4 in the units place. So, 4,14,...,484. Let me see: starting at 4, each step of 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 -4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 480-489 isn't, but 480-488 is included. So, let's count how many full groups of 100 there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 groups, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, is that correct? Let me check: 40-49: 10 numbers, each with 4 in the tens place. Similarly, 140-149: 10, and so on up to 440-449:10. So that's 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 include numbers beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. That's in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the formula: ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Let's count how many full groups: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, 4 full groups of 10 and one group of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90.

    "text": " But wait, does 484 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me think. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of 4's in the units place would be the number of complete decades (groups of 10) in 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, does 488 include another 4 in the units place? 488 is 488, so the units digit is 8, not 4. So, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence? Wait, no, because 484 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 4? Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to N is equal to floor((N + 1)/10). So, for N=488, it's floor(489/10)=48. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. The first range is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many such ranges are there? From 40-49 (40s), 140-149 (140s), 240-249 (240s), 340-349 (340s), and 440-449 (440s). That's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But in each of these, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Wait, let me check that again. Units: 48, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 4's. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 ends with 8, we have 49 occurrences. Wait, no, because from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (1-480), which gives 48 8's, and then 481-488 includes another 8 at 488. So, total units place 8's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these contributes 10 8's in the tens place. How many such ranges are there? From 80-89 (80s), 180-189 (180s), 280-289 (280s), 380-389 (380s). That's 4 ranges, each contributing 10 8's, so 4*10=40. But wait, does 480-489 also count? Wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the 480s. But the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but in the tens place, the 8 is in the tens digit, so 480-489 would have 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, does that mean an extra 9 8's in the tens place? Wait, no, because in the tens place, 480-489 would have 10 8's, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, that's an extra 9 8's in the tens place beyond the regular 4 ranges. So, total tens place 8's: 4 ranges (80s, 180s, 280s, 380s) each with 10, so 4*10=40, plus the 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. Wait, but is 480-488 considered a separate range? Because 480-489 would be the 480s, but since we stop at 488, it's only 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. Therefore, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 8's in tens place: 10. From 180-189: 10. From 280-289: 10. From 380-389: 10. That's 40. Then from 480-488: 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So total 40 + 9 = 49 in the tens place. Units place: 49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. So total 8's: 98. Now, number of 4's was 187, number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's. Let me recount the 4's: units place: 48, tens place:50, hundreds place:89. 48+50=98, +89=187. That seems correct. For the 8's: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets of 10, contributing 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges (40s, 140s, 240s, 340s, 440s), each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (including 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full ranges contributing 40 occurrences, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence. Wait, actually, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so the number of 4's in the units place is the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra numbers. Let me think: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete decades and 8 extra numbers. In each decade, the units digit 4 appears exactly once. So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does the 48th decade end at 480? So, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the 48th decade, which is 481-490, but since the book stops at 488, the units digits go up to 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once every 10 numbers, and since 488 is less than 490, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 times. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490), but the last decade only goes up to 488, so the units digit 4 appears once in each decade except possibly the last one. Wait, in the last decade, 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the units digit 4 would still appear at 484, which is within 481-488. So, yes, the units digit 4 appears 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449, and also in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, we have to check if 480-488 includes the tens digit 4. So, for the tens digit 4, each block of 100 numbers has a decade where the tens digit is 4. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449, and 480-489. However, since the book ends at 488, the 480-489 block only goes up to 488, but the tens digit is still 4 for all numbers from 480 to 488, except 489 is beyond 488. So, how many full decades have the tens digit 4? Let's see: The first is 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. And then 480-488: 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times in each of the first four blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), which is 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, in the 480-488 block, the tens digit is 4 for all 9 numbers, so that's 9 more. So total 40 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488. So, yes, 9 numbers. So, tens place: 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book ends at 488, it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 49 + 89. Let me add that up: 48 + 49 = 97, plus 89 is 186. So, 4's appear 186 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is the 48th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, units place: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in decades like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book ends at 488, so the last decade is 480-488. Let's count: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 times. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers (480-488). So, total in tens place: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 from the last partial block, so 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. So, total number of 8's is 48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 186 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in decades like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in numbers 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 48 + 49 + 89 = 186.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in decades like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as there are no pages 800-899.\n- **Total 8's:** 48 + 49 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 186 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence? Let me check. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4). Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, from 140-149, and 240-249, and 340-349. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? Let's see. The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10, and so on. Now, how high do these blocks go? Since the book has 488 pages, the last block would be 340-349 because 440-449 would go beyond 488? Wait, no, 440 is less than 488, so 440-449 is within the book. Wait, let me check: 440 is page 440, and 449 is page 449, which is less than 488. Then, the next block would be 440-449, and then 540-549, but 540 is beyond 488, so that block doesn't exist. So, how many blocks are there? Let's see: 40-49 (block 1), 140-149 (block 2), 240-249 (block 3), 340-349 (block 4), and 440-449 (block 5). Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. Wait, but wait a second. Let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, that's a valid block. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens in the range 400-488. So, from page 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. So, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many times this happens. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full cycles, each contributing an 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, does that add an extra 8? Let me think: 10 \u00d7 48 = 480, so 480 + 8 = 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, the number of terms is 49. Wait, because starting at 8 (which is the first term), then 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me check: the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Now, let's see how many such blocks there are. The first block is 80-89, then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. The next block would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the block is only up to 488. So, how many full blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89 (block 1), 180-189 (block 2), 280-289 (block 3), 380-389 (block 4), and 480-488 (block 5, but only 9 numbers since 488 is the last page). Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit is 8 from 480 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 in 9 numbers, not 10. So, for the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, the fifth block (480-488) contributes 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 98 8's. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " But wait, let me check: from 4 to 484, that's every 10th number starting at 4. So, the count should be (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, so 49 times in the units place. Wait, but does 484 count as a units place? Yes, because 484 ends with a 4. So, 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, but since we're only going up to 488, 440-449 is fine. Let's count how many sets of ten there are where the tens digit is 4. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. But wait, does 440-449 include 440 to 449, which is 10 numbers, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is okay. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, in these numbers, the hundreds digit is 4, so each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place.

So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such sets exist. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. So, 4 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 40 times. But wait, does 480-489 exist? Yes, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, for the tens place, 480-488 has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, in the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) and then an additional 9 in 480-488. So, total is 4*10 +9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, that's 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the hundreds place with 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have missed something.\n\nFor the 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50=99+89=188.\n\nFor the 8's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit from the right):**\n     - Numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n     - Total: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit from the right):**\n     - Numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n     - Each set has 10 numbers, and there are 5 such sets.\n     - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit from the right):**\n     - Numbers: 400-488.\n     - Total: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n     - Total: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - Numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n     - First four sets have 10 numbers each, and the last set (480-488) has 9.\n     - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - No page numbers from 800-899 exist in a 488-page book.\n     - Total: 0.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Difference = Number of '4's - Number of '8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are \\boxed{90} more 4's than 8's printed."

    "text": " But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4. So, that's 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many full ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 50 times. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each number from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds digit. So, that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 times. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because it's the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8. Wait, no, because 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is the range. Let's count how many full ranges there are. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9, totaling 4*10 +9=49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8. The ranges are 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 4 full tens ranges and one partial. So 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, yes, 49 times. So, the total number of 4's is 187 and 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. 48+50=98, plus 89=187. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 48 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. There are 4 full ranges (40 numbers) and a partial range (9 numbers), totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by **89**.\n\n\\boxed{89}"
