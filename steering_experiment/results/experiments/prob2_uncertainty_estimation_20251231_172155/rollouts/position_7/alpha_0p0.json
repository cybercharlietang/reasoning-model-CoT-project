    "text": " \n\nLet me start by analyzing the single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digit 4 appears once (page 4), and the digit 8 appears once (page 8). So, for single-digit pages, the count is equal for both digits: 1 each.\n\nNext, I'll look at the two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a ones place. I should consider each digit position separately.\n\nStarting with the tens place: For two-digit numbers, the tens digit can range from 1 to 9. So, the tens digit being 4 occurs in the range 40-49. That's 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Similarly, the tens digit being 8 occurs in the range 80-89, which is also 10 numbers. So, in the tens place, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times each.\n\nNow, looking at the ones place for two-digit numbers: For each set of ten numbers (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the ones digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each set, the digit 4 appears once (like 14, 24, ..., 94), and the digit 8 appears once (like 18, 28, ..., 98). There are 9 sets of ten in two-digit numbers (10-99), so the ones digit 4 appears 9 times, and the ones digit 8 also appears 9 times.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, from 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers, which is 9 sets of 10. So, for the ones place, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 9 times. So, both 4 and 8 appear 9 times each in the ones place.\n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times. In the ones place, 4 appears 9 times, 8 appears 9 times. So, total for two-digit numbers: 4 appears 10 + 9 = 19 times, and 8 appears 10 + 9 = 19 times. So, again, they're equal in two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because there are three digit positions: hundreds, tens, and ones. I'll need to analyze each position separately.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, let's see when the hundreds digit is 4. That would be from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times.\n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can't be 8 because 800 is beyond 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0-9 for each hundreds group. Let's break it down:\n\n- For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each of these can have tens digits from 0-9, and ones digits from 0-9. So, for each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundreds group, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), and similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 180-189, 280-289, 380-389). Since there are three such hundreds groups, the digit 4 appears 3 * 10 = 30 times in the tens place, and the same for 8.\n\n- Now, for the hundreds group 400-488: The tens digit can be 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. Now, when does the tens digit equal 4? That would be pages 440-449. Similarly, when does the tens digit equal 8? That would be pages 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 pages because 488 is the last page. Let me check: 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place for 400-488, digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488). \n\nSo, total for the tens place in three-digit numbers: 4 appears 30 (from 100-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 40 times. 8 appears 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the ones place in three-digit numbers. Again, let's break it down by hundreds groups.\n\n- For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each hundreds group has 100 numbers, so the ones digit cycles through 0-9 ten times. So, for each hundreds group, the digit 4 appears in the ones place 10 times (e.g., 104, 114, ..., 194; same for 200s and 300s). Similarly, 8 appears 10 times in the ones place for each hundreds group. Since there are three such groups, 4 appears 3 * 10 = 30 times, and 8 appears 30 times.\n\n- For the hundreds group 400-488: The ones digit cycles from 0-9 for each tens group. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the ones place. \n\nFirst, the number of numbers in 400-488 is 89 (as calculated earlier). Each tens group (like 400-409, 410-419, etc.) has 10 numbers, except the last one, which is 480-488, which has 9 numbers. So, for each tens group from 400-479, the ones digit cycles 0-9, so 4 appears once per tens group, and 8 appears once per tens group. \n\nHow many full tens groups are there? From 400-479, that's 8 tens groups (400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479). Each contributes 1 occurrence of 4 and 8 in the ones place. So, 8 times each. \n\nThen, the last tens group is 480-488, which has 9 numbers. In the ones place, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, in 480-488, the ones digits go from 0-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). \n\nSo, total for 400-488 in the ones place: 8 (from 400-479) + 1 (from 480-488) = 9 times for 4, and similarly 8 + 1 = 9 times for 8.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because in each full tens group (400-409, 410-419, etc.), the ones digit cycles through 0-9, so for each of these 8 tens groups, 4 appears once in the ones place, and 8 appears once. So, that's 8 times each. Then, in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488), the ones digits are 0-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total for 400-488 in ones place: 8 + 1 = 9 for 4, and 8 + 1 = 9 for 8.\n\nWait, but let me count again. From 400-479, there are 8 tens groups, each contributing 1 occurrence of 4 and 1 of 8 in the ones place. So, 8 each. Then, in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, the ones digits go up to 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total for 400-488: 8 + 1 = 9 for 4, and 8 + 1 = 9 for 8.\n\nSo, in the ones place for three-digit numbers, 4 appears 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39 times. 8 appears 30 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, that can't be right because from 400-488, the ones digit 4 appears 9 times and 8 appears 9 times, so adding to the previous 30 each, making 39 each. Hmm, but let me check if that's accurate.\n\nWait, in 400-488, for the ones place, we have:\n\n- 400-409: ones digits 0-9, so 4 appears once (404), 8 appears once (408)\n- 410-419: same, 414 and 418\n- ...\n- 470-479: same, 474 and 478\n- 480-488: ones digits 0-8, so 484 and 488\n\nSo, for each of the 8 full tens groups (400-409 to 470-479), we have one 4 and one 8 in the ones place. That's 8 each. Then, in 480-488, we have one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So, that's 9 each for 4 and 8 in the ones place from 400-488. Therefore, adding to the 30 from 100-399, we get 39 each.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me think again. From 100-399, each hundreds group has 10 occurrences of 4 and 8 in the ones place, so 3 groups * 10 = 30 each. Then, from 400-488, in the ones place, 4 appears 9 times and 8 appears 9 times. So, total ones place for 4: 30 + 9 = 39, and same for 8: 39.\n\nNow, let me sum up all the occurrences for 4 and 8 in three-digit numbers.\n\nFor 4:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 times (400-488)\n- Tens place: 40 times (30 from 100-399, 10 from 400-488)\n- Ones place: 39 times (30 from 100-399, 9 from 400-488)\nTotal 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 times.\n\nFor 8:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\n- Tens place: 39 times (30 from 100-399, 9 from 400-488)\n- Ones place: 39 times (30 from 100-399, 9 from 400-488)\nTotal 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78 times.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8 in three-digit numbers again. Earlier, I thought it was 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39. But let me make sure that's correct.\n\nIn the tens place for 100-399, each hundreds group has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place (e.g., 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), so 3 groups * 10 = 30.\n\nIn 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8. So, when the tens digit is 8, the pages are 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, total 30 + 9 = 39, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the ones place, 8 appears 30 times from 100-399 and 9 times from 400-488, totaling 39.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (ones) = 168.\n\nTotal 8's in three-digit numbers: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (ones) = 78.\n\nNow, let me add up all the occurrences across all page numbers.\n\nFirst, single-digit pages:\n- 4: 1\n- 8: 1\n\nTwo-digit pages:\n- 4: 19\n- 8: 19\n\nThree-digit pages:\n- 4: 168\n- 8: 78\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check these calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with single-digit:\n- 4: 1\n- 8: 1\n\nTwo-digit:\n- Tens place: 10 each\n- Ones place: 9 each\nTotal: 19 each\n\nThree-digit:\n- 4's:\n  - Hundreds: 89\n  - Tens: 40\n  - Ones: 39\nTotal: 89 + 40 = 129; 129 + 39 = 168\n- 8's:\n  - Hundreds: 0\n  - Tens: 39\n  - Ones: 39\nTotal: 78\n\nAdding up:\n4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - 4 appears once (page 4).\n   - 8 appears once (page 8).\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - **Ones place:** 4 appears 9 times (14, 24, ..., 94), 8 appears 9 times (18, 28, ..., 98).\n   - Total for two-digit pages: 19 each.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 appears 0 times.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears 40 times (30 from 100-399, 10 from 400-488), 8 appears 39 times (30 from 100-399, 9 from 400-488).\n   - **Ones place:** 4 appears 39 times (30 from 100-399, 9 from 400-488), 8 appears 39 times (30 from 100-399, 9 from 400-488).\n   - Total for three-digit pages: 168 for 4, 78 for 8.\n\n**Total counts:**\n- 4's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188\n- 8's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I think it's easier to count the occurrences of each digit in each place and then add them up. \n\nStarting with the units place. For each complete set of ten numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears once. But since the book goes up to 488, I need to check if the last set is complete or not. \n\nLet me calculate how many complete sets of ten there are in 488 pages. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten and then an extra 8 pages (481-488). So, in the units place, for each of the 48 complete sets, both 4 and 8 appear once each. That gives 48 times for each. Now, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, the digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). Therefore, in the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, so far, they are equal in the units place. \n\nNext, let's move to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89). \n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, which means there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an extra 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 times 10 is 40 for each digit. Now, in the extra 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 480-488). Let me check how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. \n\nFrom 401-410: tens digit is 0, so no 4 or 8.\nFrom 411-420: tens digit is 1, no.\n...\nFrom 441-450: tens digit is 4, so that's 10 times.\nFrom 451-460: tens digit is 5, no.\n...\nFrom 481-490: tens digit is 8, but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 times (480-488, but wait, 480 is included? Wait, 480 is part of 401-488. Wait, 480 is 480, which is within 401-488. So, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but that's only 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, 480 is included. Wait, 480 is the first page with tens digit 8 in this range, and then up to 488, which is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages. Wait, but 480 is part of 480-488, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages. But wait, 480 is the only page with tens digit 8 in that range? No, wait, 480 is 480, which is 4 8 0, so tens digit is 8. Then 481 is 4 8 1, same tens digit, up to 488, which is 4 8 8. So, that's 9 pages where the tens digit is 8. So, in the extra 88 pages, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449, but wait, 440 is within 401-488, right? 440 is 440, which is within 401-488, so 440-449 is 10 pages where the tens digit is 4. So, 10 times for 4, and 9 times for 8. \n\nWait, but wait, 480 is part of the extra 88 pages, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times (from 480 to 488, inclusive). So, in the tens place, for the extra 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times. \n\nSo, adding up, in the tens place, 4 appears 4*10 + 10 = 50 times, and 8 appears 4*10 + 9 = 49 times. \n\nWait, let me confirm that. Each complete hundred (1-100, etc.) contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40 for 4 and 4*10=40 for 8. Then, in the extra 88 pages (401-488), 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total for tens place: 40 +10=50 for 4, and 40 +9=49 for 8. \n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times. \n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only present in three-digit numbers, which start from page 100. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so it doesn't count. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4. \n\nSo, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place? \n\nFor 4: From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nFor 8: Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place. \n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. \n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences of 4 and 8 across all digit places. \n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal for 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal for 8: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 48 complete sets of ten, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 +1=49 for 4, same for 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8. 4 hundreds, so 40 each. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), 440-449 is 10 times for 4, and 480-488 is 9 times for 8. So, 40 +10=50 for 4, and 40 +9=49 for 8. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, 89 pages, so 89 times for 4. No 8's in hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAdding up: 49+50+89=188 for 4, and 49+49+0=98 for 8. Difference is 90. \n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place in the extra 88 pages. From 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, correct. For 8 in the tens place, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 9 times for 8 in the tens place. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to check: total number of digits printed. Let me see, but that might be more complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the total number of 4's and 8's in each place.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's consider each digit place separately and count how many times each digit appears.\n\nUnits place:\n- For 488 pages, how many times does 4 appear in units place? Every 10 pages, so total number is floor(488/10) = 48, and if the last digit is >=4, add 1. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, and since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is greater than 4, so add 1, making it 49. Similarly for 8: floor(488/10)=48, and since 488 mod 10=8, which is equal to 8, so add 1, making it 49. So, units place: 49 each.\n\nTens place:\n- For 488 pages, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, number of complete hundreds is 4 (1-400), and then 88 pages left (401-488). In each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49), and 8 appears 10 times (80-89). So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10=40 each. Now, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, for tens digit 4, it's from 440-449, which is 10 pages. For tens digit 8, it's from 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, total in tens place: 40 +10=50 for 4, and 40 +9=49 for 8.\n\nHundreds place:\n- From 1-99, hundreds digit is 0, so no 4 or 8. From 100-199, hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4. So, 4 appears in hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages (488-400+1=89). 8 never appears in hundreds place because the book ends at 488. So, hundreds place: 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nAdding up:\n- 4: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think of another way. Maybe using a formula for digit counting.\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears from 1 to n can be calculated by considering each digit place separately. For each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), we can calculate the number of times d appears.\n\nFor units place:\n- The number of times d appears is given by (n // 10) * 1 + min(max(n % 10 - d + 1, 0), 10) if d !=0, else n//10.\n\nWait, maybe that's more complicated, but let's try it.\n\nFor digit 4 in units place up to 488:\n- n=488\n- d=4\n- count = (488 //10)*1 + max(0, (488 %10) -4 +1) if 4 <= (488%10) else 0\n- 488//10=48, so 48*1=48\n- 488%10=8, so 8-4+1=5, so 48 +5=53? Wait, that can't be right because earlier we thought it was 49.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misapplying the formula. Let me check the formula again. The formula for the number of times digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is:\n\ncount = (n // 10) * 1 + (if (n %10) >=d then 1 else 0)\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The correct formula is:\n\nFor units digit:\n- The number of times d appears is (n // 10) + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. For each complete set of 10, d appears once. Then, in the incomplete set, if the last digit is >=d, add 1.\n\nSo, for units digit 4 up to 488:\n- 488//10=48 complete sets, each contributing 1, so 48\n- 488%10=8, which is >=4, so add 1\nTotal: 48 +1=49, which matches our earlier count.\n\nSimilarly, for units digit 8:\n- 488//10=48\n- 488%10=8 >=8, so add 1\nTotal:48 +1=49.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nFor tens digit:\nThe formula is a bit more involved. The number of times d appears in the tens place from 1 to n is:\n\ncount = (n // 100) * 10 + (if (n % 100) >= d*10 then (n %100) - d*10 +1 else 0)\n\nWait, let's test it for d=4 and n=488.\n\nn=488, d=4\n- 488//100=4\n- 4*10=40\n- 488%100=88\n- Since 88 >=40, add (88 -40 +1)=49\nSo, total count=4*10 +49=40+49=89? Wait, that doesn't match our earlier count.\n\nWait, but earlier we had for tens place, 4 appears 50 times, but according to this formula, it's 89? That can't be right because 89 is more than the total number of pages.\n\nWait, I must be applying the formula incorrectly. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the formula for the tens digit is:\n\nFor each complete hundred, the digit d appears 10 times in the tens place. Then, in the incomplete hundred, if the tens digit is >=d, add the difference plus one.\n\nWait, let's break it down.\n\nn=488, so the number of complete hundreds is 4 (since 4*100=400). Each complete hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 for d=4.\n\nNow, the incomplete hundred is from 401 to 488, which is 88 pages. The tens digit in this range goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for d=4 in the tens place, it's from 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, add 10.\n\nThus, total for tens place: 40 +10=50, which matches our earlier count.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8 in the tens place:\n- Complete hundreds: 4*10=40\n- Incomplete hundred: from 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 pages (since 488 is included). So, add 9.\nTotal:40 +9=49, which matches our earlier count.\n\nSo, the formula works when applied correctly.\n\nFor the hundreds place, as we saw, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place, so 0 times.\n\nThus, adding up all the occurrences:\n\nFor 4:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50+89=188\n\nFor 8:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is calculated by examining each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - Each complete set of 10 pages contributes one 4.\n   - There are 48 complete sets (480 pages), contributing 48 fours.\n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) include one more 4 (page 484).\n   - Total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - Each complete set of 100 pages contributes 10 fours.\n   - There are 4 complete hundreds (400 pages), contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 fours.\n   - The last 88 pages (401-488) include 10 fours in the tens place (440-449).\n   - Total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - From page 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4, contributing 89 fours (488 - 400 + 1).\n   - Total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\n**Total 4's**: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - Similar to 4, there are 48 complete sets, contributing 48 eights.\n   - The last 8 pages include one more 8 (page 488).\n   - Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - Each complete set of 100 contributes 10 eights.\n   - There are 4 complete hundreds, contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights.\n   - The last 88 pages include 9 eights in the tens place (480-488).\n   - Total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - The hundreds digit never reaches 8 in the range 1-488.\n   - Total 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\n**Total 8's**: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference**: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll do this for both 4 and 8, and then compare the counts.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. Units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (e.g., 4, 14, 24, etc.). So, from 1 to 488, how many full sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 full sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 occurrences. But wait, after 480, we have 481 to 488, which is 8 more numbers. In this range, the units digit 4 appears once at 484. So, total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: Similarly, for the tens place, 4 appears in a block of 10 numbers every 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488? From 1 to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), or 4 (400-488). \n\n- For hundreds digit 0 (1-99): There's one block (40-49), contributing 10.\n- For hundreds digit 1 (100-199): Another block (140-149), contributing another 10.\n- Similarly, for hundreds digits 2, 3, and 4, each has a block in the tens place. But wait, for hundreds digit 4, the tens block is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's another 10. \n\nWait, let me check: 100-199: 140-149 is 10. 200-299: 240-249 is 10. 300-399: 340-349 is 10. 400-488: 440-449 is 10. So that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. But wait, does the 440-449 block go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so it's fine. So, 40 occurrences in the tens place.\n\n3. Hundreds place: Now, the hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: Units (49) + Tens (40) + Hundreds (89) = 49 + 40 = 89; 89 + 89 = 178. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 40 is 89, plus 89 is 178. Hmm, but let me double-check the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers, so each of those has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I add units, tens, and hundreds, I get 49 + 40 + 89 = 178. Hmm, that seems high, but let me see if it's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the digit 8:\n\n1. Units place: Similar to 4, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full tens are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once at 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: For the tens digit, 8 appears in blocks of 10 every 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block contributes 10 occurrences. Let's count how many such blocks are in 1-488.\n\n- Hundreds digit 0 (1-99): 80-89 is one block, contributing 10.\n- Hundreds digit 1 (100-199): 180-189 is another block, contributing 10.\n- Hundreds digit 2 (200-299): 280-289 is another block, contributing 10.\n- Hundreds digit 3 (300-399): 380-389 is another block, contributing 10.\n- Hundreds digit 4 (400-488): Now, 480-489 would be the next block, but since the book ends at 488, we only have 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (from hundreds digits 0 to 3) and one partial block of 9. So, 4*10 = 40, plus 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is another 10, 380-389 is another 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. Yes, that's correct.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but wait a second. When I calculated the tens place for 8, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, that's 9 occurrences. So, 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, totaling 49.\n\nNow, comparing the counts:\n\nNumber of 4's: 178\nNumber of 8's: 98\n\nSo, the difference is 178 - 98 = 80.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because 178 seems high for 4's. Let me recount:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: From 1-488, every 10 numbers, one 4 in units. So, 48 full sets (1-480), each contributing 1, so 48. Then, 481-488: 484 is the only one with a units 4, so 1 more. Total units: 49.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49: 10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So, 5 blocks, each 10, so 50. Wait, earlier I thought it was 4 blocks, but actually, from 40-49 (hundreds digit 0), 140-149 (hundreds digit 1), 240-249 (hundreds digit 2), 340-349 (hundreds digit 3), and 440-449 (hundreds digit 4). So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by only counting 4 blocks. So, tens place for 4's is 50, not 40.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that's different from before. So, I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49 as before.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 5 blocks, but the last block is only 9. So, 4 blocks of 10 and 1 of 9: 4*10 +9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, 8's total: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, 4's: 188, 8's:98. Difference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because earlier I thought 4's were 178, but upon recounting, it's 188. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, in the tens place for 4's, I initially thought 4 blocks, but actually, it's 5 blocks because hundreds digits go from 0 to 4 (since 400-488 is included). So, 40-49 (hundreds 0), 140-149 (hundreds 1), 240-249 (hundreds 2), 340-349 (hundreds 3), and 440-449 (hundreds 4). So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. So, 50 in tens place, 49 in units, and 89 in hundreds, totaling 188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, in the tens place, it's 5 blocks, but the last one is only 9, so 49.\n\nSo, 4's:188, 8's:98, difference:90.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I'm overcounting somewhere.\n\nWait, when I count the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4's, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 5*10=50.\n\nUnits place: For 4's, every 10 numbers, one 4. So, from 1-480, 48 sets, so 48. Then, 481-488: 484 is the only one, so 1. Total 49.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: same as 4's, 49.\n\nTens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, 5 blocks, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, 4 blocks of 10, 1 block of 9: 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, 49+49=98.\n\nThus, 4's:188, 8's:98. Difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because I thought initially it was 178, but upon recounting, it's 188. Let me check another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor units place:\n\nTotal numbers:488.\n\nFor digit d in units place: floor((488 + d)/10). Wait, no, perhaps a better way is to consider how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nIn units place, each digit from 0-9 appears equally, except possibly the last partial set.\n\nSo, for units place:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears: floor((488 + 10 - d)/10).\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of it as (n // 10) + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0), but adjusted for each digit.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute for each digit:\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears: floor(488 /10) =48 full cycles, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, check if the last partial set (481-488) includes a 4. 484 is in this range, so +1, total 49.\n\nSimilarly for 8: floor(488 /10)=48, and 488 is included, so +1, total 49.\n\nFor tens place:\n\nEach digit appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n\nSo, number of times digit d appears in tens place: (n // 100) *10 + extra.\n\nBut let's think for 4 in tens place:\n\nFrom 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n\nEach of these is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in tens place:\n\n80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n\nEach of the first four is 10, the last is 9, so 4*10 +9=49.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\n4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\n8 appears from 800-899, but since the book is only 488 pages, 8 doesn't appear in hundreds place, so 0.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 80, but after correcting the tens place for 4's, it's 50 instead of 40, leading to 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the tens place for 4's again. From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each 10, so 50. So, yes, 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 49.\n\nSo, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I initially thought 4's were 178, but after correcting, it's 188. Let me see if there's another way to compute this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in units place from 1 to n is:\n\ncount = (n // 10) + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0).\n\nBut wait, for d=4:\n\nn=488.\n\n488//10=48.\n\n488%10=8.\n\nSince 8 >=4, add 1. So, 48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly for 8:\n\n488//10=48.\n\n488%10=8 >=8, so add 1. 48+1=49.\n\nFor tens digit:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in tens place from 1 to n is:\n\ncount = (n // 100)*10 + extra.\n\nBut more accurately, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times. So, for d=4:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds:488//100=4 (since 4*100=400 <=488).\n\nEach complete hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in tens place. So, 4*10=40.\n\nNow, for the partial hundred (401-488):\n\nThe tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is 4 8 8).\n\nSo, for d=4 in tens place in this partial hundred: the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10.\n\nSo, total for tens place 4's:4*10 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8 in tens place:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds:4, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40.\n\nIn the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's:40 +9=49.\n\nFor hundreds digit:\n\nFor d=4:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in hundreds place: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nFor d=8: since the book only goes to 488, 8 never appears in hundreds place, so 0.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems consistent now. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit unsure because earlier I thought it was 80, but after correcting the tens place count, it's 90. Let me check once more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula to calculate the number of times a digit appears in each position.\n\nFor a given digit d and position (units, tens, hundreds), the count can be calculated as follows:\n\n- For units place:\n  count = n // 10 + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0).\n\n- For tens place:\n  count = (n // 100) * 10 + ((n % 100) // 10 >= d ? (n % 100) // 10 - d + 1 : 0).\n\n- For hundreds place:\n  count = (n // 1000) * 100 + ((n % 1000) // 100 >= d ? (n % 1000) // 100 - d + 1 : 0).\n\nBut since our n=488, which is less than 1000, the hundreds place is straightforward.\n\nApplying this:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 488//10=48; 488%10=8 >=4 \u2192 48+1=49.\n- Tens: 488//100=4; (488%100)=88; 88//10=8 >=4 \u2192 8-4+1=5. So, total tens place:4*10 +5=45? Wait, that doesn't match my earlier count.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misapplying the formula. Let me think again.\n\nThe formula for tens place is:\n\ncount = (n // 100) * 10 + max(0, min((n % 100) //10, d) - d +1).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute it as:\n\ncount = (n // 100) * 10 + (if (n % 100) //10 >= d then (n % 100) //10 - d +1 else 0).\n\nSo, for d=4 in tens place:\n\nn=488.\n\nn//100=4 \u2192 4*10=40.\n\nn%100=88 \u2192 88//10=8 >=4 \u2192 8-4+1=5.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's:40 +5=45.\n\nWait, but earlier I counted 50. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is not correct. Let me think differently.\n\nIn the tens place, for each hundred, the digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, for each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nFrom 1-400:\n\n- Hundreds 0: 1-99: 10 times for 4 in tens place (40-49).\n- Hundreds 1:100-199:10 (140-149).\n- Hundreds 2:200-299:10 (240-249).\n- Hundreds 3:300-399:10 (340-349).\n- Hundreds 4:400-488: Here, the tens digit goes up to 8 (since 488). So, for 4 in tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's:5 blocks *10=50.\n\nBut according to the formula, it's 45. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is considering that in the last partial hundred, the tens digit may not reach 8. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, for d=4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's:4*10 (from hundreds 0-3) +10=50.\n\nBut according to the formula, it's 45. So, perhaps the formula isn't correctly applied here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is intended for numbers beyond 1000, but let's not get bogged down. I think my manual count is more accurate here.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place:\n\nn=488.\n\nn//100=4 \u2192 4*10=40.\n\nn%100=88 \u2192 88//10=8 >=8 \u2192 8-8+1=1.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's:40 +1=41.\n\nWait, but earlier I counted 49. So, this formula is giving me 41, which contradicts my earlier count.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is not correct. Let me think again.\n\nIn the tens place, for 8's:\n\nFrom 1-488:\n\n- Hundreds 0:80-89:10.\n- Hundreds 1:180-189:10.\n- Hundreds 2:280-289:10.\n- Hundreds 3:380-389:10.\n- Hundreds 4:480-488:9.\n\nSo, total:4*10 +9=49.\n\nBut according to the formula, it's 40 +1=41. So, the formula is undercounting.\n\nI think the formula might not be correctly applied here, possibly because it's not considering the last partial block correctly.\n\nTherefore, I think my manual count is more accurate, giving 49 for 8's in tens place.\n\nThus, sticking with my initial manual count:\n\n4's:188\n\n8's:98\n\nDifference:90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I have conflicting results from the formula. Let me try to reconcile this.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nFor tens place digit d:\n\ncount = (n // 100) * 10 + max(0, (n % 100) // 10 - d + 1).\n\nBut only if (n % 100) //10 >=d.\n\nSo, for d=4 in tens place:\n\nn=488.\n\n(n//100)=4 \u2192 4*10=40.\n\n(n%100)=88 \u2192 88//10=8 >=4 \u2192 8-4+1=5.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's:40 +5=45.\n\nBut this contradicts my manual count of 50.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is correct, and my manual count is wrong. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the hundreds 4 (400-488), the tens digit goes up to 8, so the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10.\n\nSimilarly, in hundreds 0-3, each has a tens block of 40-49, etc., which is 10 each. So, 4 blocks *10=40, plus 10 in hundreds 4, totaling 50.\n\nBut the formula is giving me 45, which suggests that in the last partial hundred, it's only adding 5, not 10. So, perhaps the formula is not suitable for cases where the last partial hundred has a full block.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misapplying the formula. Let me try to understand it better.\n\nThe formula for the number of times digit d appears in the tens place up to n is:\n\ncount = (n // 100) * 10 + max(0, (n % 100) // 10 - d + 1).\n\nBut only if (n % 100) //10 >=d.\n\nSo, for n=488, d=4:\n\n(n//100)=4 \u2192 4*10=40.\n\n(n%100)=88 \u2192 88//10=8 >=4 \u2192 8-4+1=5.\n\nSo, total 40+5=45.\n\nBut according to my manual count, it's 50. So, where is the discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is considering that in the last partial hundred, the tens digit may not reach the full 10 numbers. But in reality, in hundreds 4 (400-488), the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10.\n\nSo, the formula is undercounting by 5 in this case. Therefore, perhaps the formula is not correctly applied here, or I'm misapplying it.\n\nGiven that, I think my manual count is more accurate in this context, as it's easier to visualize.\n\nTherefore, I'll stick with my manual count:\n\n4's:188\n\n8's:98\n\nDifference:90.\n\nBut to ensure I'm not making a mistake, let me check with another approach.\n\nAnother way is to consider each digit place separately and count the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFor 4's: every 10 numbers, one 4. From 1-488, there are 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20,...,481-490), but since we're only going up to 488, the last decade is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in each full decade, one 4, so 48. In the last partial decade, 481-488, 484 is present, so +1. Total 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's: same logic, 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, and the last partial decade has 488, so +1. Total 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4's: in each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears in 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). From 1-488, we have 4 full hundreds (0-399), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is another 10. So, total 40+10=50.\n\nFor 8's: in each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears in 10 numbers (e.g.,80-89). From 1-399, we have 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. In the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor 4's: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nFor 8's: since the book ends at 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent now. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, and hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit '4':**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, '4' appears once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 full sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 '4's.\n   - The last partial set (481-488) includes 484, adding 1 more.\n   - Total: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - '4' appears in blocks of 10 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149).\n   - There are 5 such blocks (0-400, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), each contributing 10.\n   - Total: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - From 400-488, each page has '4' in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total '4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit '8':**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Similar to '4', '8' appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - 48 full sets contribute 48, with 488 adding 1 more.\n   - Total: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - '8' appears in blocks of 10 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189).\n   - There are 4 full blocks contributing 40, and the last partial block (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No pages have '8' in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total '8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by analyzing each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll do this for both 4 and 8. \n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. Units place: I need to count how many times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. Every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9, so 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That's 48 times. But wait, in the 480-488 range, the units digit goes from 0 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. So, actually, it's 48 times. But wait, let me check: from 1-480, there are 48 groups of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. Then from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so no 4. So, units place gives 48 fours.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, 4 appears in the tens place for 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, from 101-200, 140-149 is another 10 times, and so on. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4 hundreds would give 4*10 = 40 times. Now, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 0-8. So, does 4 appear in the tens place here? From 440-449, the tens digit is 4, so that's another 10 times. So, total tens place fours would be 40 + 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. Hundreds place: Now, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. Units place: How many times does 8 appear in the units place? Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. From 1-488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. That's 48 times. Now, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1-8, so 8 appears once more. So, units place eights: 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. Tens place: How many times does 8 appear in the tens place? The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. From 1-100, 8 appears in the tens place for 80-89, which is 10 times. Similarly, from 101-200, 180-189 is another 10 times, and so on. Now, how many hundreds are there in 488? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). So, in each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times, so 4*10 = 40 times. Now, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit can be 0-8. So, does 8 appear in the tens place? From 480-488, the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 numbers (480-488, but 488 is the last, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but wait, 480 is included, so actually, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 numbers. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's 9 times. So, total tens place eights: 40 (from the first 400) + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but wait, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-409) to 8 (480-488). So, for each hundred, like 400-499, the tens digit cycles 0-9. So, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 480 is included and 488 is the last). So, that's 9 times. So, total tens place eights: 4*10=40 (from 1-400) + 9=49.\n\n3. Hundreds place: Now, how many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 only from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check the units place for 8. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Every 10 numbers, once. So, 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so that's one more 8. So, 48 +1=49, which matches what I had earlier.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 4*10=40 from the first 400 pages, plus 9, totaling 49.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I calculated the fours, I got 187 fours. So, the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the fours in the tens place again. From 1-400, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times per hundred, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is another 10 times. So, 40 +10=50, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the units place, 48 fours from 1-480, and then 481-488 doesn't add any more fours in the units place, so 48 is correct.\n\nSo, total fours: 48 +50 +89=187.\n\nEights: 49 +49=98.\n\nSo, 187 -98=89.\n\nWait, but let me check the eights in the tens place again. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 4*10=40 from the first 400, plus 9=49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but hold on, in the units place, from 1-488, 488 is included, so when counting units digits, 8 appears in 8,18,28,...,488. How many times is that? Let's see: the first occurrence is 8, then every 10 numbers. So, the number of eights in the units place is floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 is included, and 488 has an 8 in the units place, it's 48 +1=49, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, from 1-488, how many times does 8 appear? In each hundred, 10 times, so 4*10=40, plus in the last partial hundred (401-488), 9 times, so 49.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 +49=98.\n\nTherefore, the number of fours is 187, and eights is 98, so the difference is 187 -98=89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first thought about it, I thought maybe the hundreds place for 4 would be 89, which is correct, but the eights don't have any in the hundreds place. So, yeah, 89 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me think again: the hundreds place for 4 is 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours there. For the eights, hundreds place is zero because the book doesn't go beyond 488. So, that's correct.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 89 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** Every 10 numbers, '4' appears once. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups of 10, contributing 48 fours. The last partial group (481-488) doesn't add any more fours in the units place.\n   - **Tens place:** In each hundred, '4' appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). With 4 complete hundreds, that's 40 fours. In the last 88 pages (401-488), '4' appears in 440-449, adding another 10 fours. Total: 50 fours.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, the hundreds digit is '4' for 89 numbers.\n   - **Total fours:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** Every 10 numbers, '8' appears once. From 1 to 488, 48 groups contribute 48 eights. The last partial group adds one more eight (488), totaling 49.\n   - **Tens place:** In each hundred, '8' appears 10 times. With 4 complete hundreds, that's 40 eights. In the last 88 pages, '8' appears in 480-488, adding 9 eights. Total: 49 eights.\n   - **Hundreds place:** '8' never appears in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total eights:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** Subtract the number of eights from fours: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 89 times more than the digit '8'.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digit 4 appears once (page 4) and the digit 8 appears once (page 8). So, for single-digit pages, both digits appear once each, meaning the difference is zero so far.\n\nNext, I'll move on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I should calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place separately and then add them up.\n\nStarting with the tens place for two-digit numbers: The tens digit can be from 1 to 9. So, for the tens place being 4, the numbers would be 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, for the tens digit being 8, the numbers are 80-89, which is another 10 numbers, so 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers: For each ten's group (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group, the digit 4 appears once (like 14, 24, etc.), and the same for 8 (like 18, 28, etc.). There are 9 groups of ten in two-digit numbers (10-99), so 4 appears 9 times in the units place, and 8 also appears 9 times.\n\nAdding up the tens and units places for two-digit numbers: 4's total is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times. Similarly, 8's total is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times. So, in two-digit pages, both digits appear 19 times each, which again makes the difference zero so far.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which go from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because each page number has hundreds, tens, and units places. I'll need to consider each place separately.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, for the hundreds digit being 4, the numbers are 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. For the hundreds digit being 8, well, since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears zero times in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be from 0 to 9, and the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. I need to calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place across all these numbers.\n\nLet's break it down by hundreds:\n\n- For hundreds digit 1 (100-199): The tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, for each hundreds group, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 140-149), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 180-189). Since there are 10 groups (0-9) in the tens place, but wait, actually, for each hundreds group, each tens digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the units place, but I'm considering the tens place. Wait, no, the tens digit is fixed for each group. So, for each hundreds group, the tens digit cycles 0-9, so each digit appears exactly 10 times in the tens place across the 100 numbers. So, for 100-199, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\n- Similarly, for hundreds digit 2 (200-299): The same applies. 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\n- For hundreds digit 3 (300-399): Again, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\n- For hundreds digit 4 (400-488): Now, this is a bit different because the range isn't 400-499 but only up to 488. So, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, actually, 400-488 includes tens digits from 0 to 8, but wait, 480-488 is the last part. Wait, actually, the tens digit for 400-488 can be 0-8, but when the tens digit is 8, the units digit only goes up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in the tens place for 400-488, how many times does 4 and 8 appear?\n\nWait, let's correct that. The hundreds digit is 4, so the tens digit can be 0-9, but since the book ends at 488, when the tens digit is 8, the units digit only goes up to 8, not 9. So, for the tens digit 4 in 400-488: The numbers would be 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nFor the tens digit 8 in 400-488: The numbers would be 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but I'm considering the tens place, so for each hundreds group, the tens digit cycles through 0-9, but in the case of 400-488, when the tens digit is 8, the units digit only goes up to 8, so it's 9 numbers instead of 10. So, in the tens place for 400-488, the digit 8 appears 9 times, not 10.\n\nSo, putting this together, for the tens place across all three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\n- Hundreds digit 3: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: 4 appears 10 times (from 440-449), 8 appears 9 times (from 480-488).\n\nSo, total for tens place:\n\n4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 times.\n\n8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. For hundreds digit 4, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, yes, 39 times for 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, considering each hundreds group separately.\n\nFor each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the units digit cycles from 0-9 for each tens digit. So, for each hundreds group, the digit 4 appears once in each ten's group, so 10 times per hundreds group (since there are 10 ten's groups). Similarly, 8 appears once per ten's group, so 10 times per hundreds group.\n\nBut wait, for the hundreds group 400-488, the units digit can go up to 8 when the tens digit is 8, so does that affect the count? Let me think. No, because for each ten's group, the units digit cycles from 0-9, except when the ten's digit is 8 in the 400-488 group, where units go only up to 8. So, for the units digit, in the 400-488 group, when the ten's digit is 8, the units digit only goes up to 8, so the digit 4 in the units place would be present in 484, but wait, 484 is within 480-488, so yes, 4 appears once in the units place for that ten's group. Similarly, 8 appears once in the units place for each ten's group except when the ten's digit is 8, where it only goes up to 8, so 8 appears once in the units place for that ten's group as well.\n\nWait, no, let me correct that. For the units place, in each ten's group, the units digit cycles through 0-9, except when the ten's digit is 8 in the 400-488 group, where it only goes up to 8. So, in the 400-488 group, for the ten's digit 8, the units digits are 0-8, so the digit 4 appears once (at 484), and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). But in other ten's groups, the units digits go from 0-9, so 4 and 8 each appear once per ten's group.\n\nSo, for the units place:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1 (100-199): 10 ten's groups, each contributing 1 occurrence of 4 and 1 of 8. So, 10 times each.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2 (200-299): Same as above, 10 times each.\n\n- Hundreds digit 3 (300-399): Same, 10 times each.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4 (400-488): Here, the ten's digits go from 0-8, so 9 ten's groups. For each ten's group except 8, the units digit goes 0-9, so 4 and 8 each appear once. For the ten's group 8, the units digit goes 0-8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, in total, for each digit, it's 9 times (once per ten's group). Wait, but let me check: For each ten's group, whether it's 0-7 or 8, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, except when the ten's digit is 8, where 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, actually, for hundreds digit 4, the units place has 9 ten's groups, each contributing one 4 and one 8, except that in the ten's group 8, both 4 and 8 appear once. Wait, that would mean 9 times for 4 and 9 times for 8 in the units place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because for each ten's group, whether it's 0-7 or 8, the units digit cycles through 0-9 except when the ten's digit is 8, where it only goes up to 8. So, for ten's digits 0-7, each contributes 1 occurrence of 4 and 1 of 8 in the units place. For ten's digit 8, it contributes 1 occurrence of 4 (at 484) and 1 occurrence of 8 (at 488). So, total for hundreds digit 4:\n\n- 4's in units place: 8 times (from ten's digits 0-7) + 1 (from ten's digit 8) = 9 times.\n\n- 8's in units place: 8 times (from ten's digits 0-7) + 1 (from ten's digit 8) = 9 times.\n\nWait, but that seems incorrect because for each ten's group, regardless of the ten's digit, the units digit cycles through 0-9 except when the ten's digit is 8, where it stops at 8. So, for ten's digits 0-7, each contributes 1 occurrence of 4 and 1 of 8. For ten's digit 8, it contributes 1 occurrence of 4 (at 484) and 1 occurrence of 8 (at 488). So, total for hundreds digit 4:\n\n- 4's in units place: 8 (from ten's digits 0-7) + 1 (from ten's digit 8) = 9 times.\n\n- 8's in units place: 8 (from ten's digits 0-7) + 1 (from ten's digit 8) = 9 times.\n\nSo, for the units place across all three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 10 times each.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2: 10 times each.\n\n- Hundreds digit 3: 10 times each.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: 9 times each.\n\nSo, total for units place:\n\n4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\n8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, that can't be right because I thought earlier that in the tens place, 4's were 40 and 8's were 39, but in the units place, both are 39. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the tens place calculation.\n\nWait, let me double-check the tens place for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: tens digits 0-9, each appearing 10 times. So, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2: same as above, 10 each.\n\n- Hundreds digit 3: same, 10 each.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: tens digits 0-8, because the book ends at 488. So, for tens digits 0-7, each appears 10 times in the tens place (since units digits go 0-9). But when tens digit is 8, the units digits only go up to 8, so that's 9 numbers (480-488). Therefore, for tens digit 8 in hundreds digit 4, it appears 9 times, not 10.\n\nSo, for hundreds digit 4:\n\n- Tens digit 4: 10 times (440-449).\n\n- Tens digit 8: 9 times (480-488).\n\nSo, total for tens place:\n\n4's: 10 (from hundreds 1) + 10 (hundreds 2) + 10 (hundreds 3) + 10 (hundreds 4, tens digit 4) = 40 times.\n\n8's: 10 (hundreds 1) + 10 (hundreds 2) + 10 (hundreds 3) + 9 (hundreds 4, tens digit 8) = 39 times.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNow, for the units place in three-digit numbers:\n\nAs calculated earlier, for each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the units digit 4 appears 10 times each, and 8 appears 10 times each.\n\nFor hundreds group 400-488:\n\n- For ten's digits 0-7: Each contributes 1 occurrence of 4 and 1 of 8 in the units place, so 8 ten's groups \u00d7 1 = 8 each.\n\n- For ten's digit 8: Units digits go up to 8, so 484 is 4, and 488 is 8. So, 1 each.\n\nSo, total for units place in hundreds group 4:\n\n4's: 8 + 1 = 9.\n\n8's: 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nTherefore, total units place across all three-digit numbers:\n\n4's: 10 (hundreds 1) + 10 (hundreds 2) + 10 (hundreds 3) + 9 (hundreds 4) = 39.\n\n8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, 4's appear 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 79 times.\n\nWait, no, wait: The hundreds place, tens place, and units place are all separate. So, in three-digit numbers, the total count for 4's is:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 times (from 400-488).\n\n- Tens place: 40 times.\n\n- Units place: 39 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0 times.\n\n- Tens place: 39 times.\n\n- Units place: 39 times.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78 times.\n\nNow, let's add up all the digits from single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1.\n\n- Two-digit: 19.\n\n- Three-digit: 168.\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1.\n\n- Two-digit: 19.\n\n- Three-digit: 78.\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the three-digit counts because that's where most of the digits are.\n\nIn three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), which is correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n- Tens place: 40 times for 4's, 39 times for 8's.\n\n- Units place: 39 times for both 4's and 8's.\n\nSo, 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\n8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nAdding single and two-digit counts:\n\n4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\n8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each place and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's:\n\n1. Units place:\n   - In the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups and an extra 8 numbers (481-488). \n   - In each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.). So, 48 groups \u00d7 1 = 48 times.\n   - Now, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once in 484. So, that's 1 more.\n   - Total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place:\n   - The tens place cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place within each hundred. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n   - How many hundreds do we have? From 1 to 488, that's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and an extra 88 pages (401-488).\n   - In each of the 4 full hundreds, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Now, in the extra 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. Let's see how many times 4 appears in the tens place here.\n   - From 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So, that's another 10 times.\n   - So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 = 50.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 only in the pages from 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place?\n   - From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 times.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me make sure I'm not overcounting. Each page number is only counted once, and each digit is considered in its place. So, for the hundreds place, it's correct that from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those 89 pages. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, seems a bit high, but let's go on.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. Units place:\n   - Similar to 4's, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups and 8 extra numbers.\n   - Each group contributes 1 eight in the units place (8, 18, 28, etc.), so 48 \u00d7 1 = 48.\n   - In the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 8 appears once in 488. So, 1 more.\n   - Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place:\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100. Each digit appears 10 times in the tens place per hundred.\n   - From 1 to 488, we have 4 full hundreds and 88 extra pages.\n   - In each full hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Now, in the extra 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place here?\n   - The tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 480-489. But wait, our extra pages go up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's 9 numbers, meaning the tens digit is 8 for 9 times.\n   - Wait, but 480-489 is 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 times here.\n   - So, total 8's in tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-489). So, when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times the tens digit is 8. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up all the 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 1-400, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 sets of 10, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, 40+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, when counting the 4's in the hundreds place, I said from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's. But let me confirm that: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nFor the 8's, in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems right.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place for 4's. From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 48 full groups (1-480) and then 481-488. So, 48 \u00d7 1 = 48, plus 484, which is one more. So, 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place, it's 48 full groups (1-480) giving 48 eights, plus 488, which is one more. So, 49. Correct.\n\nWait, but when I added up the 4's, I got 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. But wait, the tens place for 4's: from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Each hundred block has 10 times, so 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, 40 + 10 = 50. That's correct.\n\nSo, 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if I'm overcounting somewhere. Let me take a smaller example to check.\n\nSuppose the book has 48 pages. Let's count the 4's and 8's.\n\nPage numbers 1-48.\n\n4's:\n- Units: 4,14,24,34,44 \u2192 5 times.\n- Tens: 40-49, but since we only go up to 48, it's 40-48. So, the tens digit is 4 for 9 times (40-48).\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal 4's: 5 + 9 = 14.\n\n8's:\n- Units: 8,18,28,38,48 \u2192 5 times.\n- Tens: 40-48, the tens digit is 4, not 8. So, in 1-48, the tens digit is 8 only in 80-89, which doesn't exist here. So, 0.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal 8's: 5.\n\nDifference: 14 - 5 = 9.\n\nWait, but according to my method above, for 48 pages:\n\n4's units: 48/10 = 4.8, so 4 full groups, each contributing 1, so 4. Plus, in the extra 8 pages (41-48), 44 is one more. So, 4 + 1 = 5. Correct.\n\nTens place for 4's: 4 full hundreds? Wait, no, 48 is less than 100, so only one hundred block, which is 1-48. The tens digit is 4 for 40-48, which is 9 times. So, 9. So, total 4's: 5 + 9 = 14.\n\n8's units: 48/10 = 4.8, so 4 full groups (8,18,28,38) = 4. Plus, in the extra 8 pages (41-48), 48 is one more. So, 4 +1=5.\n\nTens place for 8's: Since 48 < 80, there are no tens digits of 8. So, 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: 5.\n\nDifference: 14 -5=9. That seems correct.\n\nSo, my method works for a smaller case. Therefore, I think my calculation for 488 pages is correct.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When counting the hundreds place for 4's, I considered pages 400-488, which is 89 pages, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. But wait, the hundreds digit is only present in three-digit numbers. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's 0. From 100-488, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, the hundreds digit is 4 only in 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place for 4's, I had 50, which includes 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, right? So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the 8's in the units place again. From 1-488, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 488 is the last one, so that's 1 more. So, 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the units place, it's 48 full groups (1-480) and then 484, which is one more. So, 49.\n\nI think I've double-checked all the parts, and everything seems consistent. So, the final answer is that there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers contain a 4 in the units place.\n   - Total groups of 10: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8)\n   - Each group contributes 1 occurrence: 48 \u00d7 1 = 48\n   - In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 484 has a 4: 1 more\n   - **Total 4's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contains 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149).\n   - Full hundreds: 4 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400)\n   - Occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40\n   - In 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (440-449)\n   - **Total 4's in tens place:** 40 + 10 = 50\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total pages: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n   - **Total 4's in hundreds place:** 89\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers contain an 8 in the units place.\n   - Total groups of 10: 48\n   - Occurrences: 48 \u00d7 1 = 48\n   - In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 488 has an 8: 1 more\n   - **Total 8's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contains 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189).\n   - Full hundreds: 4\n   - Occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40\n   - In 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers (480-488)\n   - **Total 8's in tens place:** 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - **Total 8's in hundreds place:** 0\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten pages (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten and then an extra 8 pages (481-488). So, in each of these 48 sets, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is within this range, which adds one more 4. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of ten pages. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block contributes ten 4's in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are up to 488. The first block is 40-49, which is 10 pages. The next would be 140-149, then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, how many blocks is that? Let's count: 40-49 is one, 140-149 is two, 240-249 is three, 340-349 is four, and 440-449 is five. So, five blocks, each contributing ten 4's in the tens place. That's 5 * 10 = 50. \n\nWait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, total 4's in the tens place: 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. \n\nWait, let me make sure: 400 is the first, then 401, up to 488. So, 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten pages, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of ten are there? As before, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, the extra 8 pages (481-488) include 488, so the units digit is 8 in 488. So, that's one more 8. So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many such blocks there are. \n\nFirst block: 80-89 (10 numbers). Second: 180-189 (10). Third: 280-289 (10). Fourth: 380-389 (10). Fifth: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, since 488 is the last page. So, how many 8's in the tens place here? Each full block (80-89, etc.) contributes ten 8's in the tens place, so four blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four blocks, each contributing ten 8's, so 4*10=40. Then, the fifth block is 480-488, which has 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 in all of them, so that's 9 more 8's. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so total 98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit place again for both 4's and 8's.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 48 complete sets of ten, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), 484 is there, so one more, total 49.\n- Tens place: Five blocks where tens digit is 4: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block has ten 4's, so 5*10=50.\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, 488 adds one more, total 49.\n- Tens place: Four full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing ten 8's, so 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 contributes 9 more 8's in the tens place, total 49.\n- Hundreds place: None, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. The fifth block is 480-488. The tens digit here is 8, so each number from 480 to 488 has an 8 in the tens place. That's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so 9 8's. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nI think my counts are correct. So, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. For each place, I'll calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.) and the digit 8 appears once (like 8, 18, 28, etc.). \n\nFirst, I'll figure out how many complete blocks of 10 there are in 488 pages. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, that means there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 pages (481 to 488). \n\nIn each complete block, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, for 48 blocks, that's 48 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place. Now, in the partial block from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). \n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 48 (from complete blocks) + 1 (partial block) = 49. \nTotal 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. \n\nWait, that's interesting. So, in the units place, 4 and 8 appear the same number of times. So, no difference there. Hmm, maybe the difference comes from the tens place or hundreds place.\n\nMoving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, in the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each hundred block. \n\nSo, for the digit 4 in the tens place, each hundred block contributes 10 occurrences. Similarly, the digit 8 in the tens place also contributes 10 occurrences per hundred block. \n\nNow, let's figure out how many hundred blocks we have in 488 pages. The page numbers go up to 488, so that's 4 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). \n\nWait, but the last block is only up to 488, which is 88 pages. So, I need to check if the tens digit in the last partial hundred block affects the count.\n\nFirst, for each complete hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each of these three blocks, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times as well. \n\nSo, for the first three hundreds, that's 3 blocks * 10 = 30 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, the last block is 400-488. Let's look at the tens digit here. The tens digit goes from 0 (400-409) to 8 (480-488). So, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place here?\n\nFrom 400-409: tens digit is 0, so 4 doesn't appear here.\n410-419: tens digit is 1, so no 4 or 8.\n...\n440-449: tens digit is 4, so 4 appears 10 times here.\n450-459: tens digit is 5.\n460-469: 6.\n470-479:7.\n480-488: tens digit is 8, so 8 appears 9 times because from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, no, actually, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, so 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the last block.\n\nSo, in the last block, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). \n\nTherefore, total 4's in tens place: 3 blocks *10 (from 100-399) +10 (from 440-449) = 40.\nTotal 8's in tens place: 3 blocks *10 +9 (from 480-488) =39.\n\nSo, 4's in tens place:40, 8's:39. So, 4's are more by 1 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1,2,3,4 for the respective hundreds. So, 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, 200-299:2, 300-399:3, 400-488:4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would be where 8 appears in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8's in hundreds place:0.\n\nTherefore, 4's in hundreds place:89, 8's:0. So, 4's are more by 89 here.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:40\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's:49+40+89= 178.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:39\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49+39=88.\n\nNow, the difference is 178 (4's) -88 (8's)=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because the difference seems a bit high.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 49 for both 4 and 8, correct. In the tens place, 4's had 40, 8's had 39. So, 4's are up by 1 there. In the hundreds place, 4's have 89, 8's have 0, so that's 89 more. So total difference is 1 (from tens) +89 (from hundreds) =90. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place (units, tens, hundreds):**\n\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n     - There are 48 complete decades (1-480) and 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n     - 48 occurrences of 4 and 8 each in complete decades.\n     - In 481-488, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n     - Total 4's in units: 48 + 1 = 49.\n     - Total 8's in units: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - Each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place.\n     - For 400-488, 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n     - Total 4's in tens: 3*10 +10 =40.\n     - Total 8's in tens: 3*10 +9=39.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n     - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n     - Total 4's in hundreds:89.\n     - Total 8's in hundreds:0.\n\n2. **Sum the totals:**\n   - Total 4's: 49 (units) +40 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =178.\n   - Total 8's:49 (units) +39 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =88.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - 178 (4's) -88 (8's) =90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's. So, the final answer is \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. \n\nFirst, the units place. In the units place, the digits cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's 4; in 11-20, it's 14; and so on. So, I need to figure out how many complete blocks of 10 there are in 488 pages. \n\nWait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). In each complete block, there's one 4 in the units place. So, 48 blocks would give 48 fours. Then, in the partial block from 481-488, I need to check if there's a 4 in the units place. Looking at 484, that's a 4 in the units place. So, that adds one more. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, no, actually, 488 is the last page. So, the units digits go up to 8 in the last partial block. So, 481-488: the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So, yes, 48 complete blocks give 48 fours, plus 1 more from 484, totaling 49 fours in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred from 401-488. \n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so that's 10 fours per hundred. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 fours in the tens place. Now, in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, that's 10 more fours. So, total fours in the tens place would be 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but 488 is less than 500, so the last partial hundred is 401-488. So, in 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is indeed 10 numbers. So, yes, 10 fours. So, total in tens place is 4*10 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.\n\nWait, but actually, each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. So, total fours in hundreds place: 89.\n\nNow, adding up all the fours: units place 49 + tens place 50 + hundreds place 89 = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Wait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, yes, that's 89 fours. But in the tens place, I had 50, and units place 49. So, 89 + 50 = 139, plus 49 is 188. Hmm, seems correct.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, every block of 10 has one 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing 1 eight, so 48. Then, the partial block is 481-488, which has 8 in the units place at 488. So, that's one more. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place.\n\nTens place: For the tens digit, in each block of 100, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, how many hundreds? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the partial hundred 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0.\n\nSo, total eights: units 49 + tens 49 + hundreds 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought the units place eights were 49, and tens place 49, so total 98. But let me check again.\n\nWait, in the tens place, in the partial block, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 eights. So, 40 + 9 = 49. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nUnits place: 48 complete blocks (each contributing 1 eight) plus 1 in the partial block (488), so 49.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought the hundreds place would have 0 eights, so total eights are 98.\n\nBut wait, I think I made a mistake in the units place. Let me check again. The units place: every 10 numbers have one 8. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing 1 eight, so 48. Then, in the partial block, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 is the only one with an 8 in the units place. So, that's 1 more. So, 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place eights: 49.\n\nTens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 (from partial hundred) = 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, when counting fours, I got 188 fours. So, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts.\n\nFirst, fours:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nEights:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But let me think again.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place for fours, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place for fours, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, and then in the partial hundred, 440-449, which is another 10 fours. So, 4*10 + 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is within the 400-488 range, so that's correct.\n\nFor the eights, in the tens place, in the partial hundred 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nUnits place: 48 complete blocks, each giving 1 eight, so 48, plus 1 in 488, so 49.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, fours: 188, eights: 98, difference: 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the tens place for fours again. Each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, 4 hundreds would give 40 fours, and then in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 fours. So, total 50 fours in the tens place. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights, in the tens place, each hundred has 10 eights in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, 4 hundreds give 40 eights, and in the partial hundred, 480-488, which is 9 eights. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nUnits place: 48 +1=49.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 +49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a big difference. Let me try another approach. Maybe I can count the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nAnother way: For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFor 4's: In each block of 10, one 4. So, total blocks: floor(488/10)=48, so 48 fours. Then, check if the last partial block (488%10=8, so 481-488) has a 4 in the units place. Yes, 484. So, +1. Total units fours:49.\n\nFor 8's: Similarly, each block of 10 has one 8. So, 48 blocks, 48 eights. Then, check the last partial block: 481-488. The units digit goes up to 8, so 488 has an 8. So, +1. Total units eights:49.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4's: Each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place (40-49). So, total blocks: floor(488/100)=4. So, 4*10=40 fours. Then, in the partial block (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, +10. Total tens fours:50.\n\nFor 8's: Each block of 100 has 10 eights in the tens place (80-89). So, 4*10=40 eights. In the partial block (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, +9. Total tens eights:49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor 4's: The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488. So, 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89 fours.\n\nFor 8's: The hundreds digit is 8 from 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so no eights in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nNow, adding up:\n\nFours: units 49 + tens 50 + hundreds 89 = 188.\n\nEights: units 49 + tens 49 + hundreds 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for fours was 89, but I want to make sure that's correct. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights, since the book doesn't go beyond 488, there are no hundreds digits of 8, so 0.\n\nI think I've checked it enough times, so I'm confident the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. But since page numbers start at 1, the first block is 1-10, where the units digits are 1-0. Wait, actually, from 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does the digit 8. \n\nBut I need to check how many complete blocks of 10 there are in 488 pages. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and an extra 8 pages (481-488). So, in each complete block of 10, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 blocks, that's 48 4's and 48 8's in the units place. Now, for the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, the digit 4 appears once (484), and the digit 8 appears once (488). So, in the units place, total 4's are 48 + 1 = 49, and total 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, so in the units place, they are equal. That's interesting.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, in each 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89). \n\nNow, since the book has 488 pages, we can think of it as 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times in each hundred, so 4 * 10 = 40 times. \n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. \n\nLooking at 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 401-488 is up to page 488, so 440-449 is within this range. So, that's 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 pages, right? 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's 9 times. \n\nWait, but let me check: from 401-488, the tens digits are 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages, right? Because 440 to 449 is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 times. The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages because 488 is the last page. So, 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488: that's 9 numbers. \n\nWait, but 480 is included, so from 480 to 488 is 9 pages, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here. \n\nSo, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times. \n\nTherefore, total tens digit 4's: 4*10 (from the hundreds) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50 times. \n\nTotal tens digit 8's: 4*10 (from the hundreds) + 9 (from 401-488) = 49 times. \n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times. So, 4's are more by 1 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, meaning the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nHow about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. The hundreds digits are only 1,2,3,4. So, the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit position.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Wait, in the tens place, I had 49 for 8's, right? Let me double-check.\n\nWait, earlier, in the tens place, for the first 400 pages, 4*10=40 times. Then, in 401-488, it was 9 times. So, 40+9=49 times for 8's in the tens place. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place: 4*10=40, plus 10 in 401-488, so 50.\n\nUnits place: 49 each, so 49 for 4's and 49 for 8's.\n\nHundreds place: 89 for 4's, 0 for 8's.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 +89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98. So, how many more 4's than 8's? 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting.\n\nLet me go through each digit position again.\n\nUnits place:\n- Each 10 pages, 1 four and 1 eight. 488 pages means 48 full tens, so 48 each. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488). So, total 4's:48+1=49, 8's:48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each 100 pages, 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. 400 pages have 4*10=40 fours and 40 eights. Then, 401-488: tens digits from 0-8. The fours in tens place occur in 440-449: 10 pages. Eights occur in 480-488: 9 pages. So, total fours in tens:40+10=50, eights:40+9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 400-488: 89 pages, so 89 fours. Eights: none, so 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, so the answer would be 90 more 4's than 8's. That seems correct based on my calculations. I don't see any errors in the reasoning. So, I think the answer is 90.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we need to count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks of 10 pages, contributing 48 each.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) contribute one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - Total 4's in units place: \\(48 + 1 = 49\\)\n   - Total 8's in units place: \\(48 + 1 = 49\\)\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 pages contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - There are 4 complete blocks of 100 pages, contributing 40 each.\n   - The remaining 88 pages (401-488) contribute 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n   - Total 4's in tens place: \\(40 + 10 = 50\\)\n   - Total 8's in tens place: \\(40 + 9 = 49\\)\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 contribute 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n   - There are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's in hundreds place: \\(89\\)\n   - Total 8's in hundreds place: \\(0\\)\n\nSumming up the counts:\n- Total 4's: \\(49 + 50 + 89 = 188\\)\n- Total 8's: \\(49 + 49 + 0 = 98\\)\n\nThe difference between the number of 4's and 8's is:\n\\[ 188 - 98 = 90 \\]\n\nThus, the number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\(\\boxed{90}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then a partial block of 8. In each full block, there's one 4 in the units place. So that's 48 times. Then, in the partial block from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which is another 4. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 40-49: that's one block. Then 140-149: another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's five blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, let me check: 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10. That's five sets, so 5*10=50. So the tens place contributes 50 4's.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. Wait, no, the hundreds digit is 4 only for numbers from 400 to 488, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488. So how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but wait, let me check if I counted correctly.\n\nWait, for the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. Then, for the tens place, 5 blocks of 10, so 50 4's. Units place, 49 4's. So 89 + 50 = 139, plus 49 is 188. So 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many full blocks of 10 are there? 48 full blocks (since 488 / 10 = 48.8). Each contributes one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the partial block from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 is included, which is another 8. So total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let me check: 80-89 is one block (10 numbers), 180-189 another, 280-289 another, 380-389 another, and 480-488 is a partial block. Each full block contributes 10 8's in the tens place. So how many full blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89 is one, 180-189 is another, 280-289 another, 380-389 another. That's four full blocks, each contributing 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Now, the partial block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). In these, the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So that's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So yes, 9 more. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only for numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So the hundreds place contributes 0 8's.\n\nTherefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so total 98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's and 8's.\n\nWait, for the 4's in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Then, for the tens place, 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 4's, so 50. Units place: 49. So 89 + 50 = 139, plus 49 is 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's, units place: 49, tens place: 49, so 98. So 188 - 98 = 90. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check again, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the number of 4's in the tens place. Let me recount:\n\nIn the tens place, the digit 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So that's correct.\n\nFor the 8's in the tens place, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five blocks, but the last one is partial. So 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 8's, so 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So that's correct.\n\nSo, the total 4's are 188, and 8's are 98. The difference is 90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each place and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, for each 10 pages, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. \n\nNow, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 complete sets of 10, and then an extra 8 pages (481 to 488). Wait, actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so it's 48 full decades and 8 extra pages. \n\nIn each full decade, the units digit 4 appears once, so 48 times. Similarly, the units digit 8 appears once in each decade, so 48 times. Now, looking at the extra 8 pages: 481 to 488. The units digits here are 1 through 8. So, in this partial set, the units digit 4 appears once (at 484), and the units digit 8 appears once (at 488). So, in the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 + 1 = 49, and the total number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49. So, so far, in the units place, they are equal.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8. \n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So, for the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in each hundred. So, in the first 100 pages (1-100), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49), and 8 appears 10 times (80-89). Similarly, in the next 100 pages (101-200), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (140-149), and 8 appears 10 times (180-189). This pattern continues for each subsequent hundred. \n\nSince there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 instances of 4 and 10 instances of 8 in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds times 10 gives 40 for both 4's and 8's in the tens place. \n\nNow, we have the remaining 88 pages (401-488). Let me check the tens digit in this range. From 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. Let's see: \n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 481-488 is only 8 pages, not a full 10. \n\nSo, in the tens place for 401-488:\n\n- The digit 4 appears in the tens place from 441-450, which is 10 pages (441 to 450). So, that's 10 times.\n- The digit 8 appears in the tens place from 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 pages (481-488). So, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times here.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. The tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 pages, but 480 is page 480, and 481 is the next. Wait, no, 480 is part of the 480-489 range, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 pages. But wait, 480 is included, right? So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place from 480-488.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 481-488 is 8 pages, but actually, 480 is included, so it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the last partial hundred.\n\nWait, but let me double-check: 480 is page 480, so the tens digit is 8. Then 481-488: each of these has 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 times.\n\nBut wait, in the range 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 pages, right? Because 440 is included, so 440-449 is 10 pages. So, 10 times for 4 in the tens place.\n\nSo, in the tens place for the last partial hundred (401-488):\n\n- 4 appears 10 times\n- 8 appears 9 times\n\nTherefore, adding this to the previous 400 (from the 4 full hundreds), the total for the tens place is:\n\n- 4's: 40 (from 4 hundreds) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50\n- 8's: 40 (from 4 hundreds) + 9 (from 401-488) = 49\n\nWait, so in the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 49. That means in the tens place, there's one more 4 than 8.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought 480-488 is 9 pages, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the last partial hundred. So, the 8's in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49, and 4's are 40 +10=50. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, from 1-99, there's no hundreds digit. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1. From 200-299, it's 2. From 300-399, it's 3. From 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit 4 appears in pages 400-488. How many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Let's see, 400-488 is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWhat about the hundreds digit 8? Well, in the hundreds place, 8 would appear from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, the hundreds digit 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each digit place.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\n- 4's: 49\n- 8's: 49\n\nTens place:\n\n- 4's: 50\n- 8's: 49\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 +89=188.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 +49=98.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's printed is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 188 - 98 = 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n- 488 pages, so 48 full decades (48*10=480 pages) and 8 extra pages (481-488).\n- In each decade, 1 four and 1 eight in the units place, so 48 each.\n- In the extra 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48+1=49 for both.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place.\n- 4 hundreds, so 40 each.\n- In 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449: 10 pages.\n- Tens digit 8 appears from 480-488: 9 pages (since 480 is included, making it 9 pages).\n- So, tens place: 4's = 40+10=50; 8's=40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears from 400-488: 89 pages.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place in this book.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49+0=98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nI think that's the answer. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, another way to check: perhaps using a formula or another method.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) + (if the last partial set has a 4, add 1). So, floor(488/10)=48, and since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is less than 4? No, wait, the last partial set is 481-488, so units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 is within that range, so add 1. So, 48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's: same logic, 48+1=49.\n\nFor tens digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100)*10 + extra in the last partial hundred.\n\nfloor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40.\n\nIn the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so add 10. So, total 40+10=50.\n\nFor 8's in tens place: floor(488/100)*10=40, and in the last partial hundred, tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488-480+1=9), so 40+9=49.\n\nFor hundreds digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: if the hundreds digit is 4, then the count is the number of pages from 400-488, which is 89.\n\nNumber of 8's: since 800-899 is beyond 488, it's 0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188\n\n8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. So, I'm confident the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and an extra 8 numbers. In each group of 10, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Plus, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is the only number where 4 appears in the units place. So, that's one more 4. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place: Similarly, the digit 4 appears once every 100 numbers in the tens place. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. So, how many times does this happen up to 488? Let's see, the first occurrence is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, the next would be 140-149, another 10, then 240-249, another 10, and 340-349, another 10. Now, 440-449 would be the next, but wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's another 10. So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. But wait, let me check. From 0-99, 40-49 is one set (10 numbers). Then 100-199, 140-149 is another set. Similarly, 200-299, 240-249; 300-399, 340-349; and 400-488, 440-449. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 5*10=50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 48 full decades and then 1 more, so 49. In the tens place, 5 sets of 10, so 50. In the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades (1-480) and then 8 more numbers (481-488). In each full decade, there's one 8, so 48 times. In the partial decade, 481-488, the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more 8. So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, how many sets of 100 have a full set of 10 8's in the tens place? Let's see:\n\n- 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers.\n- 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10.\n- 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10.\n- 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10.\n- 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 numbers because 488 is the last page.\n\nWait, so in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 instead of 10.\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) \u2192 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only for numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's are 188, total 8's are 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 48 full decades (1-480) \u2192 48, plus 484 in 481-488 \u2192 49.\n- Tens: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 5 sets, each with 10 4's \u2192 50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488 \u2192 89 numbers \u2192 89.\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 48 full decades (1-480) \u2192 48, plus 488 \u2192 49.\n- Tens: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 5 sets, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 (40) and 1 set of 9 (9), total 49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's correct. So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49.\n\nYes, that seems right. So, the final answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. For each place, I'll calculate how many 4's and 8's appear. \n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. \n\nNow, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 more pages (481 to 488). In each complete set of 10, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 and the number of 8's is also 48. But wait, I also have those 8 extra pages (481-488). Let me check if any of these have a 4 or 8 in the units place. 481 has 1, 482 has 2, 483 has 3, 484 has 4, 485 has 5, 486 has 6, 487 has 7, and 488 has 8. So, in the units place, we have one more 4 and one more 8 in these extra pages. Therefore, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, they are equal.\n\nNext, the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. For example, in the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 80-89, also 10 times. \n\nNow, how many hundreds do we have? The book goes up to 488, so we have 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Let me check each hundred.\n\nFrom 100-199: The tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (140-149) and 8 appears 10 times (180-189).\n\nFrom 200-299: Similarly, the tens digit cycles again, so 4 appears 10 times (240-249) and 8 appears 10 times (280-289).\n\nFrom 300-399: Again, 4 appears 10 times (340-349) and 8 appears 10 times (380-389).\n\nFrom 400-488: Here, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for 4's in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 times. For 8's in the tens place, it's 480-488. Wait, that's only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 480-488 is 9 pages, so 8's in the tens place here are 9 times. \n\nWait, but let me confirm. From 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, for each ten's digit, it's 10 numbers except for the last one, which is 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the end. So, for 4's in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. For 8's, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 4's: 10, and 8's: 9.\n\nSo, adding up across all hundreds:\n\n100-199: 4's =10, 8's=10\n\n200-299: 4's=10, 8's=10\n\n300-399: 4's=10, 8's=10\n\n400-488: 4's=10, 8's=9\n\nTotal 4's in tens place: 10+10+10+10=40\n\nTotal 8's in tens place: 10+10+10+9=39\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's are 40, 8's are 39. So, 4's are more by 1 here.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 only in 400-488, which is 89 pages (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4, not 8. So, 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89, 8's: 0.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n4's: 49, 8's:49\n\nTens place:\n\n4's:40, 8's:39\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's:89, 8's:0\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +40 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 49+40=89, 89+89=178\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +39 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =49+39=88\n\nSo, total 4's:178, total 8's:88\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 178 -88=90 more than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place:\n\nEach 10 numbers contribute one 4 and one 8. There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 480, and then 8 more pages (481-488). In those 8 pages, 484 has a 4 in units, and 488 has an 8. So, units place 4's:48+1=49, 8's:48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nFrom 100-199: 4's in tens place:140-149, 10 times. Similarly, 8's:180-189,10 times.\n\n200-299: same, 4's:240-249, 10; 8's:280-289,10.\n\n300-399: same, 4's:340-349,10; 8's:380-389,10.\n\n400-488: 4's in tens place:440-449,10. 8's in tens place:480-488, which is 9 pages because 488 is the end. So, 8's:9.\n\nTotal tens place 4's:10+10+10+10=40\n\nTotal tens place 8's:10+10+10+9=39\n\nSo, 4's in tens place:40, 8's:39.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n400-488: 4 appears in hundreds place for each page, so 488-400+1=89 pages. So, 4's:89, 8's:0.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's:49 (units) +40 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=178\n\n8's:49 (units) +39 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=88\n\nDifference:178-88=90\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each set of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10, contributing 48 each.\n   - Pages 481-488 add one more 4 and one more 8.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's for the first three hundreds (100-399).\n   - For the 400-488 range, 4's appear 10 times (440-449), while 8's appear 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40\n   - Total 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 178\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 39 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 88\n\n**Difference:** 178 - 88 = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For each complete set of ten numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. Now, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten, and then an additional 8 pages (481-488). \n\nIn each complete set of ten, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 sets, that's 48 fours and 48 eights. Now, looking at the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, there's a 4 in 484 and an 8 in 488. So that's one more 4 and one more 8. So, in the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's, 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that can't be right because 484 is within the 481-488 range, so 484 has a 4 in the units place, and 488 has an 8. So, yes, that's correct, 49 each.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place within each hundred. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (like 40-49), and similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times (like 80-89). \n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an additional 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each of the 4 complete hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 fours. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times in each hundred, so 4 * 10 = 40 eights. \n\nNow, looking at the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). Wait, but in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. \n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits cycle as follows:\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nSo, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, that's 8 numbers (481-488). Wait, no, 481-488 is 8 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 8 times in 481-488. Wait, but wait, 481-488 is part of the 401-488 range, so the tens digit 8 occurs in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. From 401-488, the tens digits go up to 8, but the number of times 8 appears in the tens place is 10 times if it's a full set, but here we only have 8 numbers (481-488). So, actually, in the tens place, 8 appears 8 times in this partial hundred. \n\nWait, but hold on, 481-488 is 8 numbers, each with tens digit 8, so that's 8 times. Similarly, 441-450 is 10 numbers with tens digit 4. \n\nSo, in the tens place for the remaining 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times. \n\nTherefore, total in the tens place:\n- 4's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50\n- 8's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 8 (from 401-488) = 48\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me confirm. Each complete hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 hundreds give 40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (441-450), and 8 occurs 8 times (481-488). So, yes, 50 fours and 48 eights in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. For pages 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, which we can ignore. So, let's consider pages 100-488. \n\nThe hundreds digit cycles as follows:\n- 100-199: hundreds digit is 1\n- 200-299: hundreds digit is 2\n- 300-399: hundreds digit is 3\n- 400-488: hundreds digit is 4\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. \n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place at all. \n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences of 4 and 8 across units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nNow for 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 49 + 48 is 97, yes. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. So, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again because 188 - 97 is indeed 91, but I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me go through each position again.\n\nUnits place:\n- Each ten has one 4 and one 8.\n- 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 and one 8.\n- 48 * 1 = 48 fours, 48 eights.\n- The remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 484 has a 4, and 488 has an 8.\n- So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 fours, 48 + 1 = 49 eights.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred has 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place.\n- 4 hundreds (1-400) contribute 4*10=40 fours and 40 eights.\n- The remaining 88 pages (401-488) have:\n  - 441-450: 10 fours in tens place.\n  - 481-488: 8 eights in tens place.\n- So, tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 fours, 40 + 8 = 48 eights.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 400-488: 89 fours in hundreds place.\n- 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each set of 10 pages (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) has one '4' and one '8' in the units place.\n   - Total complete sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 sets (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8).\n   - Each set contributes 1 '4' and 1 '8', so 48 each.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488) have '4' in 484 and '8' in 488.\n   - Total '4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total '8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred (e.g., 1-100) has 10 '4's and 10 '8's in the tens place.\n   - Total complete hundreds in 488 pages: 4 (1-400).\n   - Each contributes 10 '4's and 10 '8's, so 40 each.\n   - Remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n     - '4's in tens place: 10 (441-450).\n     - '8's in tens place: 8 (481-488).\n   - Total '4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total '8's in tens place: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so no '4's or '8's.\n   - Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is '4', appearing 89 times (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - '8's: 0, as the book doesn't reach page 800.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (number of '4's) - 97 (number of '8's) = 91.\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 91 more times than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll handle each position for both digits 4 and 8 and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. Units place: In the units place, the digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a count, we take the integer part, which is 48 times. Wait, but let me check: from 1 to 480, there are exactly 48 occurrences (since 480/10 = 48), and then from 481 to 488, the units digit 4 appears once more at 484. So, actually, it's 48 + 1 = 49 times. Hmm, maybe my initial approach was a bit off. Let me think again. For every block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But then, in the incomplete block (481-488), there's 484, which is another occurrence. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for a block of 10 numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: the first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks. Each contributes 10 4's, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does the last block go up to 449? Yes, because 440-449 is within 488. So, that's 50 times.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\nAdding these up: units place 49, tens place 50, hundreds place 89. So total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8:\n\n1. Units place: Similar to 4, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Using the same logic, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8. Then, in the incomplete block (481-488), 488 is the last number, so that's another 8 in the units place. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers instead of 10. Each complete block contributes 10 8's in the tens place. So, how many complete blocks are there? From 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's four blocks, each contributing 10 8's, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, the incomplete block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. In this block, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers (480-488), so that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding these up: units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds place 0. So total 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets of ten and then 8 extra numbers. Each set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, the 49th set is from 480 to 488, so within that, the units digit 4 appears once at 484. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, in every set of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, etc. How many such sets are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 extra numbers (401-488). Each full set contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4*10 = 40. Now, in the partial set from 401-488, how many 4's are in the tens place? From 401-410, the tens digit is 0, so no 4's. From 411-420, tens digit is 1, etc. Wait, actually, in the range 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, ..., up to 8 for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488. So, the tens digit is 8 only in 481-488, but we're looking for 4's in the tens place. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0 in 401-410, 1 in 411-420, ..., up to 8 in 481-488. None of these have a tens digit of 4, so the tens place 4's only come from the full sets. So, total tens place 4's: 40.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. How many numbers are there in this range? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (including both 400 and 488). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these 89 numbers, contributing 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: Units (49) + Tens (40) + Hundreds (89) = 49 + 40 + 89 = 178. Wait, let me check that addition again. 49 + 40 is 89, plus 89 is 178. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, in every set of ten numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full sets of ten are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the last partial set is 481-488, which includes 488, so that's another 8 in the units place at 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: In every set of 100 numbers, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 numbers (401-488). Each full set contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10 = 40. Now, in the partial set 401-488, how many 8's are in the tens place? The tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488. That's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. Each of these has an 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 more 8's. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait a minute, that can't be right because when I counted the 4's, I got 178, and the 8's are 98, so the difference would be 178 - 98 = 80. But I feel like I might have made a mistake somewhere because the difference seems a bit large. Let me double-check my counting.\n\nFirst, let me recount the 4's:\n\nUnits place: For every 10 numbers, one 4. From 1 to 488, how many 4's in the units place? Let's see: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The last term is 484, which is 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1 = 48, so n=49. So, 49 4's in the units place. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: In each hundred, 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 hundreds (1-400), so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0 in 401-410, 1 in 411-420, ..., up to 8 in 481-488. So, no 4's in the tens place beyond the first 400. So, 40 4's in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 40 + 89 = 178. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the 8's:\n\nUnits place: Same as 4's, 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus 488, which is another 8 in the units place. So, 49 8's in the units place.\n\nTens place: In each hundred, 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: As before, none, since the book ends at 488. So, 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 178 - 98 = 80. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me think again. When counting the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. Let me check: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the units place, for 8's, I counted 48 full sets (each contributing one 8) and then 488, which is another 8, making it 49. That seems right.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 178, and the total number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 80 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n- **Units place:** Every 10 numbers contribute 1 occurrence. There are 48 full sets (1-480) and one more at 484, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** Every 100 numbers contribute 10 occurrences. Four full sets (1-400) give 40, and none in 401-488, totaling 40.\n- **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 contribute 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 40 + 89 = 178.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n- **Units place:** Every 10 numbers contribute 1 occurrence. There are 48 full sets (1-480) and one more at 488, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** Every 100 numbers contribute 10 occurrences. Four full sets (1-400) give 40, and pages 480-488 add 9, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 178 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 80.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{80}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in each block of 10 numbers. So, in every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit appears once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n\nNow, let's figure out how many complete blocks of 10 there are in 488 pages. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each complete block, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 blocks, that's 48 times 4's and 48 times 8's in the units place.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so I need to check if 488 is included. Since 488 is 48*10 + 8, the 48th block ends at 480, and then we have 8 more pages: 481 to 488. So, in these 8 extra numbers, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in these, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, adding to the previous, units place 4's: 48 +1 =49, and units place 8's:48 +1=49. Wait, but 488 is 488, so in 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so yes, 8 is included. So, units place has 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once. So total units place 4's:48+1=49, same for 8's:48+1=49. So, units place contributes equally to both 4's and 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89).\n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages left (401-488). So, for each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10=40 4's and 4*10=40 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the remaining 88 pages (401-488) need to be checked for the tens digit. Let's break this down. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, in the tens place, each digit from 0-8 appears, but we need to see how many times each digit appears.\n\nWait, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. Each tens digit appears 10 times except possibly the last one if it's cut short. Let's see: 401-410: tens digit 0, 10 numbers. 411-420: tens digit 1, 10 numbers. Similarly, up to 480-488: tens digit 8, but only 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the remaining 88 pages.\n\nWait, but actually, 401-488 is 88 pages. Let me check: 488-400=88, so yes. So, starting at 401, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Each tens digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times, and the tens digit 8 appears 9 times because 480-488 is 9 numbers.\n\nWait, no, actually, 401-410: tens digit 0, 10 numbers. 411-420: tens digit 1, 10 numbers. 421-430: tens digit 2, 10 numbers. 431-440: tens digit 3, 10 numbers. 441-450: tens digit 4, 10 numbers. 451-460: tens digit 5, 10 numbers. 461-470: tens digit 6, 10 numbers. 471-480: tens digit 7, 10 numbers. 481-488: tens digit 8, 8 numbers (since 488-480=8, but including 480? Wait, 480 is included in 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 numbers, so tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the remaining 88 pages.\n\nWait, but let me recount. From 401-488, that's 88 pages. Each block of 10 in the tens place contributes 10 numbers. So, 401-410: 10 numbers, tens digit 0. 411-420: 10 numbers, tens digit 1. Similarly, up to 471-480: 10 numbers, tens digit 7. Then, 481-488: 8 numbers, tens digit 8. Wait, that's 8 numbers, but 481-488 is 8 numbers, so tens digit 8 appears 8 times, not 9. Wait, but 480 is included in the previous block, 471-480, so 480 is part of that 10 numbers. So, 481-488 is 8 numbers, so tens digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place in the remaining 88 pages.\n\nWait, so in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (in 441-450) and the tens digit 8 appears 8 times (in 481-488). So, in the tens place, for the remaining 88 pages, 4's:10, 8's:8.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 4 hundreds *10=40 plus 10 in the remaining 88 pages, so 50. Tens place 8's:4 hundreds *10=40 plus 8 in the remaining 88 pages, so 48.\n\nWait, so in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 48 times. So, that's a difference of 2 more 4's than 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me make sure I did that correctly. For the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-8. Each digit from 0-7 appears 10 times, but 8 appears only 8 times because the last block is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, yes, 4's in the tens place: 10 times (441-450). 8's in the tens place:8 times (481-488). So, adding to the 4 hundreds, which each had 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, that's 40 each. So, total tens place 4's:40+10=50, and 8's:40+8=48. So, 50-48=2 more 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case because the book has 488 pages. So, page numbers 1-99 have no hundreds digit, or the hundreds digit is 0, but we're only considering the actual digits printed, so 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit. Pages 100-199 have hundreds digit 1, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in 1-488, the hundreds digit can only be 1,2,3,4. There's no page number with hundreds digit 8 because 800 is beyond 488. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, hundreds place contributes 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the digits:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's:49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:48\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49+48=97.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 188-97=91.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 49 4's and 49 8's. In the tens place, 50 4's and 48 8's. In the hundreds place, 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the tens place.\n\nWait, in the tens place, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 times, correct. The tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times, correct. So, adding to the 40 each from the hundreds, that's 50 and 48, correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 4's, correct. No 8's in the hundreds place, correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each, plus the last 8 pages (481-488) contributing one 4 and one 8, so 49 each, correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, 8's:97, difference 91.\n\nWait, but let me check if I considered all the digits correctly. Another way to approach this is to iterate through each page number and count the digits, but that would be tedious. Alternatively, I can use a formula-based approach for each digit position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the units place. Let me recount the units place.\n\nEach block of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. There are 48 full blocks (1-480), which is 480 pages. Then, 481-488 is 8 more pages. So, in the units place:\n\nFrom 1-480: 48 blocks, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each.\n\nFrom 481-488: units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, one 4 and one 8.\n\nSo, total units place 4's:48+1=49, 8's:48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nFrom 1-400: each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) contribute 4*10=40 each.\n\nFrom 401-488: the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 441-450:10 numbers, so 10 4's. 8 appears in 481-488:8 numbers, so 8 8's.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's:40+10=50, 8's:40+8=48.\n\nHundreds place:400-488:89 numbers, so 89 4's, 0 8's.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again: 488 pages. So, pages 1-488. Let me check the hundreds place again. Pages 400-488: that's 89 pages, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nWait, but another way: for the hundreds digit, only pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. So, 488-400+1=89. Correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 97, so 188-97=91. So, there are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just think if there's another way to approach this problem, perhaps by considering each digit position separately and using a formula.\n\nFor each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), we can calculate the number of times a digit appears.\n\nIn the units place, as calculated, it's 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nIn the tens place, 50 4's and 48 8's.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's:49+50+89=188, 8's:49+48+0=97.\n\nDifference:91.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, another way: the total number of digits in the page numbers. But that might not be necessary here since we've already broken it down per digit position.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me consider the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 4's. The tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 8's. So, that's correct.\n\nIn the units place, as before, 49 each.\n\nSo, yes, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes one '4' and one '8' in the units place.\n   - There are 48 full blocks (1-480), contributing 48 each.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) contribute one '4' and one '8'.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 '4's and 10 '8's in the tens place.\n   - Four full hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 each.\n   - Remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n     - '4' appears 10 times (441-450).\n     - '8' appears 8 times (481-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 contribute 89 '4's.\n   - No '8's in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89.\n   - Total 8's: 0.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - Total 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91.\n\n**Answer:** There are 91 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For each position in the page number (units, tens, hundreds), I can calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear. Maybe I can handle each digit position separately. \n\nStarting with the units place: In every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, 4 appears once and 8 appears once in each block of 10. \n\nNow, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). So, in the units place, the number of 4's is 48 times 1 (from each block) plus any additional 4's in the partial block. Similarly for 8's.\n\nWait, but in the partial block from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial block, does 4 appear? Yes, at 484. Does 8 appear? Yes, at 488. So, in the units place, the number of 4's is 48 + 1 = 49, and the number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49 as well. Wait, that can't be right because when I count, 488 is included, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, actually, each full block of 10 contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 blocks would give 48 4's and 48 8's. Then, the partial block from 481 to 488 has 8 numbers: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, in the units place here, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, they are equal in the units place. Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers. So, in each 100-number block, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8.\n\nSo, how many full 100-number blocks are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block from 401-488. \n\nIn each full block, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4 blocks give 4*10 = 40 4's in the tens place. Similarly, 8's in the tens place would be 4*10 = 40. \n\nNow, the partial block from 401-488. Let's see, how many numbers are there here? 488 - 400 = 88, so 88 numbers. The tens digits in this range go from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 480-488). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? Well, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, our range is up to 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488, right? Wait, 440 is within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Similarly, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, in the partial block, 4's in the tens place: 10 times, and 8's: 9 times.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 401-488, the tens digits go as follows: 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, 4's: 10, 8's: 9.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 40 (from full blocks) + 10 (from partial) = 50. Tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, 8's appear 49 times. So, 4's are more by 1 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers 100 and above. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's 0. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; 400-488, it's 4. \n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the pages 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 page numbers. \n\nHow about the hundreds digit for 8? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nTherefore, hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place: 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8. So, 48 each. Then, the partial block from 481-488, which adds 1 4 (at 484) and 1 8 (at 488). So, total units 4's: 48 + 1 = 49; units 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each full 100 has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 blocks give 40 each. Then, the partial block from 401-488: 440-449 is 10 numbers with tens digit 4, and 480-488 is 9 numbers with tens digit 8. So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. 8's in hundreds place: 0. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Total 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place. Is it 89 numbers from 400 to 488 inclusive? Let's check: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAnother thing to check: when counting the tens place in the partial block, I considered 440-449 as 10 numbers, which is correct, and 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct because 488 is the last page. So, 9 numbers there.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, does 480-488 include 9 numbers? Let me list them: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers, so yes, 9 times the tens digit 8. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but another thought: when I'm counting the tens digit 8 in the partial block, I'm only considering 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but does the hundreds digit affect anything? No, because we're only looking at the tens place. So, that's fine.\n\nSimilarly, for the units digit in the partial block, 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once and 8 appears once. Correct.\n\nSo, adding it all up, 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can calculate the total number of digits printed and see if this makes sense, but that might be overcomplicating. Alternatively, I can recount each digit place to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place: 488 pages. Each 10 pages contribute 1 4 and 1 8 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, meaning 48 full sets, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8. So, 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) contribute 1 4 and 1 8. So, total units 4's: 48 + 1 = 49; units 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nTens place: Each 100 pages contribute 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's. So, 40 each. Then, the remaining 88 pages (401-488) contribute 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488). So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: Only pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's. 8's in hundreds place: 0. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Total 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - 488 pages = 48 full blocks of 10, contributing 48 each.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one 4 and one 8.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 pages contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - 488 pages = 4 full blocks of 100, contributing 40 each.\n   - The remaining 88 pages (401-488) add 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 (89 pages) have 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - 8's in the hundreds place: 0\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. For each place, I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's and then sum them up across all places.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each block of 10 numbers. For example, in 1-10, the units digits go from 1 to 0, so each digit appears once. So, for each complete set of 10 numbers, the digit in the units place cycles through 0-9. \n\nLet me figure out how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488 pages. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). \n\nIn each complete set of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 appears once. So, for 48 complete sets, the number of 4's in the units place is 48, and the number of 8's is also 48. \n\nNow, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (484), and the digit 8 appears once (488). So, adding these, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the total number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that can't be right because I think I might have made a mistake. Let me check again. \n\nWait, when I have 48 complete sets of 10, each contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so that's 48 each. Then, the last partial set from 481-488 has units digits 1-8, so 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place, and 488 is the only one with an 8 in the units place. So, that adds 1 more 4 and 1 more 8. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, they are equal.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. \n\nLet me figure out how many hundreds are in 488. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (40-49), and the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (80-89). So, for each hundred, 10 4's and 10 8's. Since there are 4 complete hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 4's and 4 * 10 = 40 8's in the tens place from the complete hundreds. \n\nNow, the last partial hundred is from 401-488. The tens digit here ranges from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. \n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for the numbers 440-449, which is 10 numbers. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, in the partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 9 times. \n\nWait, but wait, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit, the numbers are 10 each except for the last one, which might be shorter. So, for the tens digit 0: 401-410 (10 numbers), 1: 411-420 (10), 2: 421-430 (10), 3: 431-440 (10), 4: 441-450 (10), 5: 451-460 (10), 6: 461-470 (10), 7: 471-480 (10), 8: 481-488 (8 numbers). So, the tens digit 8 appears in 8 numbers, not 10. \n\nSo, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). \n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 = 50. The number of 8's in the tens place is 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 = 49. \n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times. So, 4's have 1 more in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. Let's see, the hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. \n\nSo, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the highest page is 488, so the hundreds digit only goes up to 4. \n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, units place:\n- 48 complete sets of 10: 48 * 1 = 48\n- Partial set 481-488: 484 and 488, so 2 more? Wait, no, units digit 4 is only in 484, and 8 is only in 488. So, units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49, 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Complete hundreds: 4 * 10 = 40 each\n- Partial hundred (401-488): 4's in tens place: 10 (440-449), 8's in tens place: 9 (480-488). So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's: 89 times (400-488)\n- 8's: 0 times. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to make a mistake in the partial sets. Let me verify the counts again.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\nEvery 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484). So, total 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in 481-488, 8 appears once (488). So, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n- For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9, each appearing 10 times. So, 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digits go up to 8. The 4 in tens place appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. The 8 in tens place appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 10 + 40 = 50 for 4's, and 9 + 40 = 49 for 8's. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- Only from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up:\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is 188, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I think this approach will make it easier to count without missing any numbers. \n\nFirst, for the units place. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the units place across all page numbers, and similarly for 8. \n\nStarting with 4's in the units place: The numbers would be 4, 14, 24, 34, ..., up to the largest number less than or equal to 488. Let me figure out how many such numbers there are. The first number is 4, and each subsequent number is 10 more. So, the sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. Wait, 484 is the last one because 494 would be 494, which is beyond 488. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? \n\nThe formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. Here, the first term is 4, the last term is 484, and the common difference is 10. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place.\n\nNow, for 8's in the units place: Similarly, the numbers would be 8, 18, 28, 38, ..., up to 488. Let me check the last term. 488 is within the range, so the last term is 488. So, using the same formula: first term 8, last term 488, common difference 10. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 8 in the units place.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So, the difference here is zero. But I need to check the other digit places as well.\n\nNext, let's move to the tens place. Again, I'll count the number of 4's and 8's in the tens position across all page numbers.\n\nStarting with 4's in the tens place: The numbers would be 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, 440-449 is okay because 449 is less than 488, but 540-549 would be beyond 488, so we don't need to consider that. So, how many numbers are there in each of these ranges?\n\nEach range like 40-49 has 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges. So, 5 ranges * 10 numbers each = 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Wait, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, right? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nNow, for 8's in the tens place: The numbers would be 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the range. So, how many numbers are in 480-488? That's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, each of the other ranges (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers, but the last one, 480-488, has only 9. So, how many ranges? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 ranges. The first four each contribute 10 numbers, and the fifth contributes 9. So, total occurrences of 8 in the tens place would be (4 * 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, so 4's in the tens place: 50, 8's in the tens place: 49. So, so far, 4's are ahead by 1 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. Here, I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds digit.\n\nFor 4's in the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences of 4.\n\nFor 8's in the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, the count is 0.\n\nSo, 4's in the hundreds place: 89, 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place for 4's: 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 8's: 8,18,...,488. (488 -8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place for 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nTens place for 8's: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. The first four ranges have 10 each, last has 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 8's: None, so 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89=188. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98. Correct.\n\nDifference:188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first thought about the units place, I thought maybe 4's and 8's would have the same count, but the tens and hundreds places give 4's more counts. So, the final difference is 90.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just think if there's any other way this could be approached or if I might have missed something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula for counting digits in each position. For example, in the units place, for numbers from 1 to N, the number of times a digit d appears is calculated by (N // (10)) * 1 + min(max(N % 10 - d + 1, 0), 10). But maybe that's overcomplicating it. Alternatively, for each digit position, calculate how many full groups of 10, 100, etc., there are, and then the remainder.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try this method to confirm.\n\nLet's try for 4's in the units place.\n\nTotal numbers:488.\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10:488 //10=48. Each group contributes 1 occurrence of 4 in the units place. So, 48*1=48.\n\nThen, the remainder is 488%10=8. So, in the incomplete group, we check if 4 <=8. Yes, so add 1 more. So total 48+1=49. Which matches my earlier count.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place:\n\n488//10=48, so 48 occurrences.\n\n488%10=8. Now, since 8 is the digit we're counting, and 8<=8, so add 1. So, total 48+1=49. Correct.\n\nNow, for the tens place, let's try the formula.\n\nFor 4's in the tens place:\n\nWe can think of each 100 numbers as having a block where the tens digit cycles through 0-9. For each block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49). So, for N=488, how many full hundreds are there? 488//100=4 (since 4*100=400). Each contributes 10 occurrences, so 4*10=40.\n\nNow, the remainder is 488%100=88. So, in the remaining 88 numbers (from 400 to 488), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? The tens digit in 400-488 is 0-8. So, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But since 488 is less than 449? Wait, no, 449 is less than 488. Wait, no, 449 is 449, and 488 is higher. So, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total in the remainder is 10. So, total 4's in tens place:40+10=50. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place:\n\nEach full hundred contributes 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place (80-89). So, 4 full hundreds contribute 4*10=40.\n\nNow, the remainder is 88, so from 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 9 occurrences.\n\nThus, total 8's in tens place:40+9=49. Correct.\n\nNow, for hundreds place:\n\nFor 4's, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences.\n\nFor 8's, the hundreds digit is 8 from 800-899, but since our book ends at 488, there are 0 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 4's:49(units)+50(tens)+89(hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49(units)+49(tens)+0(hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the number of times the digits 4 and 8 appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **4's:** Numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **8's:** Numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - **4's:** Ranges 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each range contributes 10, totaling 50.\n   - **8's:** Ranges 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. First four ranges contribute 10 each, last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **4's:** Numbers 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n   - **8's:** No numbers in the book have 8 in the hundreds place, so 0.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll handle each place for both digits 4 and 8. \n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's. I'll go through each place one by one.\n\n1. **Units place (4's):** For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra numbers. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times. But wait, I think I should check if the last partial set (481-488) includes a 4 in the units place. 484 is within that range, so that's one more. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place (4's):** Now, for the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of 10 numbers. For example, 40-49 have 4 in the tens place. Each such block contributes 10 occurrences. How many such blocks are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds. But wait, actually, each block of 100 has one such block of 10. So from 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So that's 5 blocks, but the last one is only up to 488. Let's check each:\n\n   - 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers\n   - 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers\n   - 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers\n   - 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers\n   - 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but 440-449 is entirely within that, so 10 numbers. So total tens place 4's are 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but from 400-488, does 440-449 count? Yes, because 440 is within 400-488. So that's 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place (4's):** Now, for the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears from 400-488. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. The hundreds digit is 4 only when the number is between 400 and 499, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488. So the hundreds digit is 4 for 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So 89 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So total 4's are 188.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is indeed 188. Okay.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place (8's):** Similar to 4's, in every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the last partial set is 481-488, which includes 488, so that's one more 8. So total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place (8's):** For the tens place, the digit 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each such block contributes 10 occurrences. Let's see how many such blocks are there up to 488.\n\n   - 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers\n   - 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers\n   - 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers\n   - 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers\n   - 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488)\n\nWait, so in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So for the tens place, each of the first four blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) contributes 10, and the last block (400-488) contributes 9. So total tens place 8's are 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10\n100-199: 180-189 \u219210\n200-299:280-289\u219210\n300-399:380-389\u219210\n400-488:480-488\u21929\nTotal: 10+10+10+10+9=49. So yes, 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place (8's):** The hundreds digit is 8 only when the number is between 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So hundreds place 8's are 0.\n\nNow, summing up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo total 4's are 188, and total 8's are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But let me check another way. Maybe I can think of each digit place separately and see if I counted correctly.\n\nAnother approach: For each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: Every 10 numbers, one 4. So from 1-488, how many 4's in units? 488 \u00f710 =48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, check the last partial ten: 481-488. 484 is there, so one more. So 48 +1=49.\n\n- Tens place: Every 100 numbers, there's a block of 10 where tens digit is 4. So 40-49, 140-149, etc. From 1-488, how many such blocks? 488 \u00f7100=4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing one block of 10, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, check the last partial hundred: 400-488. In this, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total tens place 4's: 40 +10=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, hundreds digit is 4. So how many numbers? 488 -400 +1=89. So 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: Similar to 4's. 488 \u00f710=48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. Last partial ten: 481-488 includes 488, so one more. So 48 +1=49.\n\n- Tens place: Every 100 numbers, there's a block of 10 where tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, etc. From 1-488, how many such blocks?\n\n   - 0-99:80-89\u219210\n   - 100-199:180-189\u219210\n   - 200-299:280-289\u219210\n   - 300-399:380-389\u219210\n   - 400-488:480-488\u21929 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers)\nTotal: 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: As before, 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98.\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nI think that's correct. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n1. **Counting 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each place and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's consider the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). In each complete set, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, for 48 sets, that's 48 times each. Now, looking at the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, the digit 8 appears once in the units place, and 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. So, adding that, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48, and the number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, hold on, let me check that again. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for 488 numbers, the number of times each digit appears in the units place is 48 full cycles (each contributing one 4 and one 8) plus the remaining 8 numbers. In those 8 numbers, units digits are 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear, but 8 does. So, 4's in units place: 48, and 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place contributes 48 fours and 49 eights.\n\nNext, let's move to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, it appears 10 times in each 100 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), same for 8 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). Now, how many full hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each full hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times per hundred, so 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, looking at the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, but wait, 440-449 is part of 401-488? Let me check. 401-488 includes 440-449, yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times here. For 8, does it appear in the tens place in 401-488? The tens digit goes up to 8 in 480-488, so 8 appears 10 times in 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 9 times? Wait, no, because from 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers (480-488). So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the remaining 88 pages. \n\nWait, let me clarify. The tens digit in 401-488: from 401 to 409, the tens digit is 0; 410-419, tens digit 1; ... up to 480-488, tens digit 8. So, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). \n\nSo, total in the tens place: 4's are 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50. 8's are 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 (from 401-488) = 49. \n\nWait, but wait, when I calculated the full hundreds, each hundred contributes 10 times for both 4 and 8 in the tens place. So, 4 full hundreds give 4*10=40 for both. Then, in the remaining 88 pages, 440-449 gives 10 fours, and 480-488 gives 9 eights. So, total fours in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. Eights: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 for all these 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place in the remaining pages.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's zero. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, and 3 for 300-399, etc. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so the hundreds digit is 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours and 0 eights.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- Each 10 numbers: 1 four and 1 eight.\n- 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1 four and 1 eight, so 48 fours and 48 eights.\n- Remaining 8 numbers: 481-488, units digits 1-8, so one eight, no fours.\n- Total fours: 48, eights: 48 +1 =49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each 100 numbers: 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place.\n- 4 full hundreds (1-400), so 4*10=40 fours, 40 eights.\n- Remaining 88 numbers (401-488):\n  - Fours in tens place: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours.\n  - Eights in tens place: 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights.\n- Total fours: 40 +10=50, eights:40 +9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- Fours: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n- Eights: 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 +50 +89=187.\n\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98.\n\nDifference:187-98=89.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers because 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nAnother way to check: total number of digits. Let me see, but maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider each digit place again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the units place as 48 fours and 49 eights. Tens place: 50 fours and 49 eights. Hundreds place:89 fours and 0 eights. So, adding up, 48+50+89=187 fours, and 49+49+0=98 eights. 187-98=89. So, 89 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. In the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit for 440-449 is 4, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. For 480-488, the tens digit is 8, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. That seems correct.\n\nWait, another thought: when calculating the units place, I considered 488 as the last page, so units digits go up to 8 in 488. So, in the units place, for each full set of 10, 4 and 8 each appear once. So, 48 full sets, then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 times, and 8 appears 48 +1=49 times. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, for the remaining 88 pages, 440-449 is 10 fours, and 480-488 is 9 eights. So, that adds 10 fours and 9 eights. So, total fours in tens place:40 +10=50, eights:40 +9=49.\n\nWait, but 401-488 is 88 pages. So, 401-488 is 88 numbers. So, in the tens place, 440-449 is 10 numbers, which is part of 401-488. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, that's 10+9=19 numbers accounted for in the tens place. The rest of the tens digits in 401-488 don't contribute to fours or eights. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the hundreds place again. From 1-99, hundreds digit is 0, so no fours or eights there. From 100-399, hundreds digit is 1,2,3, so no fours or eights. From 400-488, hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 fours. So, correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the total number of fours is 48 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =187.\n\nTotal eights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:187-98=89.\n\nSo, the answer should be 89 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Analyze Each Digit Place Separately:**\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - For every 10 numbers, each digit (0-9) appears once in the units place.\n     - In 488 pages, there are 48 complete sets of 10, contributing 48 fours and 48 eights.\n     - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) add one more eight in the units place.\n     - Total fours in units place: 48\n     - Total eights in units place: 49\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - For every 100 numbers, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n     - In 488 pages, there are 4 complete sets of 100, contributing 40 fours and 40 eights.\n     - The remaining 88 numbers (401-488) include 10 fours (440-449) and 9 eights (480-488).\n     - Total fours in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50\n     - Total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - From 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, contributing nothing.\n     - From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times.\n     - The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n     - Total fours in hundreds place: 89\n     - Total eights in hundreds place: 0\n\n2. **Sum the Counts:**\n   - **Total Fours:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187\n   - **Total Eights:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference:**\n   - Difference = Total Fours - Total Eights = 187 - 98 = 89\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 89 more times than the digit 8.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. For each place, I'll calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear. \n\nStarting with the units place. For any range of numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in the units place, right? So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits go from 1 to 0, so each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers. But wait, in this case, since the book starts at page 1, the first page is 1, not 0, so the units digits from 1 to 9 each appear once in the first 9 pages, and then 0 appears once at page 10. But maybe it's easier to think in terms of complete groups of 10. \n\nSo, for the units place, the number of times 4 appears would be the number of complete groups of 10 multiplied by 1 (since each group has exactly one 4 in the units place). Similarly for 8. But I also need to check if there's an incomplete group at the end. \n\nThe total number of pages is 488. Let's see how many complete groups of 10 there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra pages. \n\nIn each complete group of 10, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so each digit, including 4 and 8, appears exactly once per group. Therefore, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 times 1, which is 48. Similarly, the number of 8's in the units place is also 48. \n\nBut wait, I have 8 extra pages after the 480th page. These are pages 481 to 488. Let's check the units digits here: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So, in these 8 pages, the units digit is 4 once and 8 once. So, adding these to the previous counts, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49 as well. \n\nHmm, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So, the difference in the units place is zero. \n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-99, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. \n\nSo, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89). \n\nNow, how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 extra pages (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times for 4, and similarly 40 times for 8. \n\nNow, let's look at the incomplete hundred, which is from 401 to 488. The tens digit here goes from 0 (for 401-410) to 8 (for 480-488). So, let's break it down: \n\n- Pages 401-410: tens digit is 0\n- Pages 411-420: tens digit is 1\n- Pages 421-430: tens digit is 2\n- Pages 431-440: tens digit is 3\n- Pages 441-450: tens digit is 4\n- Pages 451-460: tens digit is 5\n- Pages 461-470: tens digit is 6\n- Pages 471-480: tens digit is 7\n- Pages 481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nSo, in this incomplete hundred, the tens digit is 4 in pages 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 4 appears 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit is 8 in pages 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 appears 8 times. \n\nTherefore, in the tens place, the total number of 4's is 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from incomplete hundred) = 50. The total number of 8's is 40 + 8 = 48. \n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 48 times, giving a difference of 2 more 4's than 8's in the tens place. \n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers from 100 onwards. For pages 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, which we can ignore since we're only counting 4's and 8's. \n\nFrom 100 to 488, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place. \n\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1\n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2\n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4\n\nSo, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488. That's 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nWhat about 8? Well, the hundreds digit cycles through 1,2,3,4, etc., so 8 would appear in the hundreds place if there were pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0. \n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. The difference here is 89 - 0 = 89. \n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each digit place. \n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nNow, the difference is total 4's minus total 8's: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49 for both, correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 4's and 10 8's. 4 hundreds, so 40 each. Then, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (441-450) and 8 for 8 pages (481-488). So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 8 = 48 for 8's. That seems right.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 doesn't appear at all, so 0. That's correct.\n\nAdding up: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 for 4's, and 49 + 48 + 0 = 97 for 8's. 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because when I think about the hundreds place, 488 is the last page, so from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, which is correct. So, 4 appears 89 times there, and 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider whether the hundreds digit is being counted correctly. For example, page 400 has hundreds digit 4, and so does 401, etc., up to 488. So, that's 89 pages, correct.\n\nAnother way to check: total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 97, so the difference is 91. Hmm, that seems plausible, but let me see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately and then sum them up. Let's try that again.\n\nUnits place:\n- For 488 pages, how many 4's in units place? As before, 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have one more 4 (page 484). So, total 49.\n- Similarly, 48 + 1 = 49 for 8's (page 488).\n\nTens place:\n- For each hundred, 10 times each digit appears in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds, 10 each, so 40 for 4's and 40 for 8's.\n- Then, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (440-449) and 8 for 8 pages (480-488). So, 10 more 4's and 8 more 8's.\n- Total: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 8 = 48 for 8's.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 doesn't appear.\n\nAdding up:\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n- Difference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. We analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n- Complete groups: 48 groups \u2192 48 occurrences each.\n- Pages 481-488 add one more 4 and one more 8.\n- Total 4's: 49, Total 8's: 49.\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n- Complete hundreds: 4 \u2192 40 each.\n- Pages 401-488: 10 more 4's (441-450) and 8 more 8's (481-488).\n- Total 4's: 50, Total 8's: 48.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n- 8 does not appear.\n- Total 4's: 89, Total 8's: 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n- 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91.\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 91.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering single-digit page numbers. These are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digit 4 appears once (page 4), and the digit 8 appears once (page 8). So, in single-digit pages, both 4 and 8 occur once each. That means the difference here is zero. \n\nNext, I'll move on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I should count the occurrences of 4 and 8 in both places separately. \n\nStarting with the tens place for two-digit numbers: The tens digit can be from 1 to 9. For the digit 4 in the tens place, the numbers would be 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place, the numbers are 80-89, which is another 10 numbers, so 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. \n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers: The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each ten. So, for each ten (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place (e.g., 14, 24, ..., 94). There are 9 tens (10-99), so 4 appears 9 times in the units place. Similarly, 8 appears once in each ten's units place, so 8 appears 9 times in the units place. \n\nAdding these up for two-digit numbers: 4's in tens place (10) + 4's in units place (9) = 19 times. 8's in tens place (10) + 8's in units place (9) = 19 times. So, again, the difference between 4's and 8's in two-digit numbers is zero. \n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me check again. For two-digit numbers, the tens place for 4 is 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. The units place for 4 is 14,24,...,94, which is 9 times because from 10-99, there are 9 sets of ten. Similarly, for 8, tens place is 80-89 (10 times) and units place is 18,28,...,98 (9 times). So, yes, 10+9=19 for both 4's and 8's, so no difference there. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because each number has a hundreds, tens, and units place. I need to count the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each of these places. \n\nLet's start with the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit ranges from 1 to 4. \n\nFor the digit 4 in the hundreds place: This occurs in the numbers 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nFor the digit 8 in the hundreds place: Wait, the hundreds digit can only be up to 4 because the book ends at 488. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all in three-digit numbers. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place. \n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be from 0 to 9, and the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. \n\nFirst, let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. For each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.). \n\nBut wait, for the 400-488 group, the tens digit goes up to 8, so the numbers with tens digit 4 would be 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, for each hundred group, the number of times 4 appears in the tens place is 10. There are 4 hundred groups (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), so 4 times 10 equals 40. But wait, in the 400-488 group, the tens digit can go up to 8, but since we're only considering up to 488, does that affect the count? Hmm, no, because 440-449 is within 400-488, so it's still 10 numbers. So, 4 appears 40 times in the tens place across all three-digit numbers. \n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place: Let's check each hundred group. In 100-199, the tens digit 8 occurs in 180-189, which is 10 numbers. Same for 200-299 (280-289), 300-399 (380-389), and 400-488 (480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers). Wait, that's a problem. So, in the 400-488 group, the tens digit 8 would be from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, for 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times. \n\nSo, let's calculate this. For the first three hundred groups (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so 3 x 10 = 30. Then, for 400-488, it's 9 numbers. So, total 8's in the tens place are 30 + 9 = 39 times. \n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me double-check. For 400-488, the tens digit 8 would be in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, yes, 9 times. So, total 8's in the tens place across all three-digit numbers is 3 x 10 + 9 = 39. \n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each combination of hundreds and tens digits. \n\nFirst, let's count how many times 4 appears in the units place. For each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), and for each tens digit (0-9), the units digit 4 occurs once every 10 numbers. \n\nSo, for each hundreds group, there are 10 possible tens digits (0-9), and for each, the units digit 4 occurs once. So, per hundreds group, that's 10 x 1 = 10 occurrences. \n\nBut wait, for the 400-488 group, the tens digits go up to 8, so the tens digits are 0-8, which is 9 tens digits. So, in this group, the units digit 4 would occur 9 times (once for each tens digit from 0-8). \n\nSo, let's calculate this. For the first three hundred groups (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each has 10 tens digits, so 10 occurrences each. That's 3 x 10 = 30. For the 400-488 group, it's 9 occurrences. So, total 4's in the units place across all three-digit numbers is 30 + 9 = 39 times. \n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place: Let's check each hundreds group. For 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each has 10 tens digits, so the units digit 8 occurs 10 times per hundred group. So, 3 x 10 = 30. For the 400-488 group, the tens digits go up to 8, so again 9 tens digits, each contributing one occurrence of 8 in the units place. So, 9 times. Thus, total 8's in the units place are 30 + 9 = 39 times. \n\nWait, but let me think again. For the units digit, in each hundred group, regardless of the hundreds and tens digits, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, for each hundred group, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is 10, except for the last hundred group (400-488), where the units digit can only go up to 8 in the last set. Wait, no, that's not correct. The units digit can still go up to 9, but the page numbers only go up to 488, so in the 400-488 group, the units digit can go up to 8 only when the tens digit is 8. Wait, no, actually, the units digit is independent. So, for example, in 400-488, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, the units digit can be 0-9, except that when the tens digit is 8, the units digit can only go up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). \n\nSo, for the 400-488 group, the units digit 8 occurs in each tens group except when the tens digit is 8, where it only occurs once (at 488). Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me try a different approach. \n\nFor the units digit 8 in the 400-488 group: \n\n- For tens digits 0-7: Each of these has units digits 0-9, so 8 occurs once per tens digit, so 8 occurrences (tens digits 0-7). \n\n- For tens digit 8: The units digit can only go up to 8, so 8 occurs once at 488. \n\nSo, total in the 400-488 group: 8 + 1 = 9 times. \n\nTherefore, total 8's in the units place across all three-digit numbers: \n\n- 100-199: 10 times \n\n- 200-299: 10 times \n\n- 300-399: 10 times \n\n- 400-488: 9 times \n\nTotal: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 39, but now I'm breaking it down more precisely and still getting 39. So, 39 times for 8's in the units place. \n\nSo, summarizing three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4's in hundreds place: 89 times \n\n- 4's in tens place: 40 times \n\n- 4's in units place: 39 times \n\nTotal 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 times \n\nFor 8's in three-digit numbers:\n\n- 8's in hundreds place: 0 times \n\n- 8's in tens place: 39 times \n\n- 8's in units place: 39 times \n\nTotal 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78 times \n\nWait, but let me check that again. Earlier, I thought 8's in tens place were 39 and units place 39, so total 78. \n\nNow, adding up all the 4's and 8's across all page numbers:\n\nTotal 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1 \n\n- Two-digit: 19 \n\n- Three-digit: 168 \n\nTotal: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188 times \n\nTotal 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1 \n\n- Two-digit: 19 \n\n- Three-digit: 78 \n\nTotal: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98 times \n\nWait, but let me double-check the three-digit counts because that's where most of the numbers are. \n\nWait, earlier I calculated 4's in three-digit numbers as 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168. \n\n8's in three-digit numbers: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78. \n\nSo, total 4's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188 \n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98 \n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I did the three-digit counts correctly. Let me check again, especially the tens and units places. \n\nLet me recalculate the tens place for 4's in three-digit numbers. \n\nFor each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers in each group except possibly the last one. \n\nIn 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers \n\n200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 \n\n300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 \n\n400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 \n\nSo, that's 4 x 10 = 40 times. Correct. \n\nFor 8's in the tens place in three-digit numbers: \n\n100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 \n\n200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 \n\n300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 \n\n400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 \n\nTotal: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 \n\nThat's correct. \n\nFor units place, 4's in three-digit numbers: \n\nEach hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) has 10 occurrences of 4 in the units place per hundred. So, 10 x 3 = 30. \n\nIn 400-488: For each tens digit from 0-8, the units digit 4 occurs once, so 9 times. \n\nTotal: 30 + 9 = 39 \n\nCorrect. \n\nFor units place, 8's in three-digit numbers: \n\nEach of the first three hundreds has 10 occurrences. \n\nIn 400-488: For tens digits 0-7, units digit 8 occurs once each (8 occurrences), and for tens digit 8, units digit 8 occurs once at 488. \n\nSo, 8 + 1 = 9 \n\nTotal: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 \n\nCorrect. \n\nSo, total 4's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188 \n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98 \n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90 \n\nWait, but I'm getting 90, but I think I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me check the three-digit counts again. \n\nWait, in the hundreds place for 4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times. \n\nTens place for 4's: 40 times \n\nUnits place for 4's: 39 times \n\nTotal: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nFor 8's: \n\nHundreds place: 0 \n\nTens place: 39 \n\nUnits place: 39 \n\nTotal: 78 \n\nSo, total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188 \n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98 \n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90 \n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I counted the units place correctly for 4's and 8's in the three-digit numbers. Let me think about the units digit again. \n\nIn each hundreds group (100-199, etc.), the units digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers, so 10 times per hundred. So, 3 hundreds give 30, and the last hundred (400-488) gives 9, as the tens digit only goes up to 8, so 9 units digits. So, 30 + 9 = 39. Correct. \n\nSimilarly, for units digit 8, same logic applies: 30 from the first three hundreds, and 9 from the last hundred, totaling 39. \n\nSo, I think the counts are correct. \n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90. \n\nWait, but I think I might have missed something. Let me check the two-digit numbers again. \n\nIn two-digit numbers, 4's: tens place 10, units place 9, total 19 \n\n8's: tens place 10, units place 9, total 19 \n\nSo, correct. \n\nSingle-digit: both 1 \n\nSo, total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188 \n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98 \n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90 \n\nHmm, I think that's correct. \n\nWait, but let me think about the three-digit numbers again. \n\nWait, in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times 4. \n\nIn the tens place, 40 times 4 \n\nIn the units place, 39 times 4 \n\nTotal 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 \n\nSimilarly, for 8's: \n\nTens place: 39 \n\nUnits place: 39 \n\nTotal: 78 \n\nSo, yes, 168 + 19 + 1 = 188 for 4's \n\n78 + 19 + 1 = 98 for 8's \n\nDifference: 90 \n\nI think that's correct. \n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit page numbers.\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - 4 appears once (page 4).\n   - 8 appears once (page 8).\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **4's:**\n     - Tens place: 40-49 (10 occurrences).\n     - Units place: 14, 24, ..., 94 (9 occurrences).\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **8's:**\n     - Tens place: 80-89 (10 occurrences).\n     - Units place: 18, 28, ..., 98 (9 occurrences).\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **4's:**\n     - Hundreds place: 400-488 (89 occurrences).\n     - Tens place: 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 (40 occurrences).\n     - Units place: 104, 114, ..., 484 (39 occurrences).\n     - Total: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n   - **8's:**\n     - Hundreds place: 0 occurrences (since the book ends at 488).\n     - Tens place: 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 (39 occurrences).\n     - Units place: 108, 118, ..., 488 (39 occurrences).\n     - Total: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\n**Total occurrences:**\n- 4's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n- 8's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. For each place, I'll calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every group of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for 8 (like 8, 18, 28, etc.). \n\nNow, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then a partial group of 8 pages (481 to 488). \n\nIn each complete group of 10, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 complete groups, that's 48 times 1 for 4's and 48 times 1 for 8's. So, 48 4's and 48 8's from the units place so far.\n\nNow, let's look at the partial group from 481 to 488. The units digits here are 1 through 8. So, the digit 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, adding these, we have 48 + 1 = 49 4's and 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place. Wait, but 488 is included, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's correct, both 4 and 8 appear once in the partial group. So, units place gives us 49 of each.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (like 40-49), and the same for 8 (like 80-89). \n\nHow many complete hundreds are there in 488? There are four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. Wait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so we have four complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488, which is 88 pages. \n\nIn each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times. So, for four hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 4's and 40 8's from the tens place.\n\nNow, looking at the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digit in this range is 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-488). So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place when the tens digit is 4, which is 440-449. That's 10 pages, so 10 4's in the tens place. The digit 8 appears when the tens digit is 8, which is 480-488. That's 9 pages (480-488 inclusive). Wait, 480-488 is 9 pages because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, 9 8's in the tens place for the partial hundred.\n\nSo, adding this up, in the tens place, we have 40 (from the four complete hundreds) + 10 = 50 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 8's.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. From 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. When the tens digit is 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page, so 9 8's. So, yes, 10 4's and 9 8's in the tens place for the partial hundred. So, total tens place: 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. That's 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, let me confirm: 400-488 is 89 pages, correct. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place, and 0 8's.\n\nNow, let me sum up all the occurrences of 4 and 8 across units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each group of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n- 48 complete groups (1-480) give 48 4's and 48 8's.\n- The partial group (481-488) adds one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n- Total: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n- Four complete hundreds (1-400) give 40 4's and 40 8's.\n- The partial hundred (401-488) adds 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n- Total: 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, contributing 89 4's.\n- No 8's appear in the hundreds place.\n- Total: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll count the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each place and then add them up. \n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, every 10 consecutive numbers will have exactly one 4 and one 8. For example, in 1-10, 4 is in 4 and 8 is in 8. This pattern repeats every 10 numbers. So, I can figure out how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488 and then multiply by 1 for each digit (4 and 8). But wait, 488 isn't a multiple of 10, so I'll have to check the remaining numbers after the last complete set of 10.\n\nLet me calculate how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete sets of 10 and 8 extra numbers. Each complete set contributes 1 four and 1 eight in the units place. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48, and the number of 8's is also 48. Now, I need to check the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) to see if there are any additional 4's or 8's in the units place. Looking at 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, there's one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). Therefore, the total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49, and the 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, both digits appear 49 times. \n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), then 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), and so on up to 9 (90-99). So, in each block of 100, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. \n\nSince the book has 488 pages, we can think of it as 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of 4's and 8's in the tens place in each complete hundred. Each hundred contributes 10 instances of each digit in the tens place. So, for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times for each digit. \n\nNow, let's look at the remaining 88 pages (401-488). The tens digit in this range goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, we need to check how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. \n\nIn the range 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410 (10 numbers), 1 for 411-420 (10 numbers), and so on up to 8 for 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last page). \n\nSo, the tens digit 4 appears in the block 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 would be in 440-449, but 440-449 is within 401-488. So, that's 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. \n\nTherefore, in the tens place, the number of 4's is 40 (from the complete hundreds) plus 10 (from 440-449) = 50. The number of 8's is 40 (from the complete hundreds) plus 9 (from 480-488) = 49. \n\nWait, let me check that again. The complete hundreds contribute 4*10=40 for each digit. Then, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times, so adding 10 to the 40 gives 50 for 4's. For 8's, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 times, so adding 9 to the 40 gives 49 for 8's. So, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times. \n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only present in three-digit numbers, which are from 100-999. In our case, the book goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. \n\nFor each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the hundreds digit is constant for all numbers in that block. \n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199 (100 numbers), 2 for 200-299 (100 numbers), 3 for 300-399 (100 numbers), and 4 for 400-488 (89 numbers, since 400-488 is 89 numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). \n\nSo, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488, which is 89 times. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4 at maximum. Therefore, the number of 4's in the hundreds place is 89, and the number of 8's is 0. \n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each place. \n\nStarting with the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours.\n\nNow for the 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The question asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's, so we subtract 98 from 188.\n\n188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with units place: 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing 1 four and 1 eight, so 48 each. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), we have 484 and 488, so 1 four and 1 eight. So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 fours, 48 + 1 = 49 eights. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each complete hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens digit. 4 complete hundreds give 40 fours and 40 eights. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449 (10 numbers) and 8 in 480-488 (9 numbers). So, tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 fours, 40 + 9 = 49 eights. That adds up.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 never appears. So, hundreds place: 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\nAdding up fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. \n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each set of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 each.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) add one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - Total: 49 fours, 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights.\n   - 4 complete hundreds contribute 40 each.\n   - In 401-488, fours appear 10 times (440-449), and eights appear 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 fours, 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Fours appear 89 times (400-488).\n   - Eights do not appear.\n   - Total: 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- Fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- Eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 fours - 98 eights = 90 more fours.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). \n\nSo, total units place 4's: 48 (from complete groups) + 1 (from partial) = 49. Similarly, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that's interesting. So, in the units place, 4 and 8 appear the same number of times. Hmm, but maybe this is different in other digit places. Let me check the tens place next.\n\nIn the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers, same with 8. \n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are four hundreds: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so I need to be careful here.\n\nFor each hundred, except the last one, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for 100-199, 200-299, and 300-399, each of these is a full hundred, so the tens digit 4 appears 10 times in each, and same for 8. So, that's 3 hundreds, so 3 times 10 = 30 for 4's and 30 for 8's. \n\nNow, the last hundred is 400-488. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. From 400 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit, there are 10 numbers, except for the last one which only goes up to 88, but wait, 488 is the last page, so the tens digit in 400-488 goes from 0 to 8. \n\nWait, actually, in 400-488, the tens digit cycles through 0 (400-409), 1 (410-419), ..., up to 8 (480-488). So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which is only 9 times because 488 is the end. Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place. Hmm, but wait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, 400-409: tens digit 0, 10 numbers.\n410-419: tens digit 1, 10 numbers.\n...\n470-479: tens digit 7, 10 numbers.\n480-488: tens digit 8, 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488).\n\nSo, in the tens place for 400-488, the digit 4 appears in the tens place when the tens digit is 4, which would be 440-449, right? Wait, no, that's the hundreds place. Wait, no, in the tens place, 4 would be when the tens digit is 4, so 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in 400-488. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, in 400-488, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that for each full hundred, 4 and 8 appear 10 times each in the tens place. So, for 100-199, 200-299, and 300-399, each has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place. Then, in 400-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total tens place 4's: 3*10 + 10 = 40. Tens place 8's: 3*10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 40 times and 8 appears 39 times. So, so far, units place: 49 each, tens place: 40 and 39. Now, let's move on to the hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, the digits go from 1 to 4 because the book has 488 pages. So, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nFor each hundred, the hundreds digit is fixed. So, in 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4.\n\nNow, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8? The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89. 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 40\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 40 + 89 = let me calculate that. 49+40 is 89, plus 89 is 178.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 39\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 39 + 0 = 88.\n\nWait, so total 4's are 178, and total 8's are 88. So, the difference is 178 - 88 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- Each group of 10 has one 4 and one 8.\n- 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1 to 4 and 1 to 8.\n- Then, the last partial group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. The units digits here are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n- So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- For each full hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each, so 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in each hundred. So, 3 hundreds give 3*10=30 for 4 and 30 for 8.\n- In 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit, there are 10 numbers except for the last one, which is 480-488, only 9 numbers.\n- The digit 4 in the tens place occurs when the tens digit is 4, which is 440-449, so 10 numbers.\n- The digit 8 in the tens place occurs when the tens digit is 8, which is 480-488, 9 numbers.\n- So, total tens place: 4's = 30 + 10 = 40, 8's = 30 + 9 = 39. That adds up.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so hundreds digit is 4, 3, 2, or 1. So, 0 times for 8. That makes sense.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49+40=89, 89+89=178.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 39 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 88.\n\nDifference: 178 - 88 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, right? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nWait, another way to check: For 4's, we have 49 in units, 40 in tens, and 89 in hundreds, totaling 178. For 8's, 49 in units, 39 in tens, and 0 in hundreds, totaling 88. The difference is 90. That seems correct.\n\nI think I did everything right. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total complete groups of 10 in 488 pages: 48 groups (480 pages), contributing 48 '4's and 48 '8's.\n   - Partial group (481-488): '4' appears once (484), '8' appears once (488).\n   - Total units place: 49 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - For 100-399: 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30 '4's and 30 '8's.\n   - For 400-488: '4' appears 10 times (440-449), '8' appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total tens place: 40 '4's and 39 '8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - '4' appears in 400-488: 89 times.\n   - '8' never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total hundreds place: 89 '4's and 0 '8's.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - '4's: 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 178.\n   - '8's: 49 (units) + 39 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 88.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 178 (4's) - 88 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' appears 90 more times than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digit 4 appears exactly once, on page 4. The digit 8 also appears once, on page 8. So, in single-digit pages, both 4 and 8 occur once each. That means the count for 4 and 8 is tied at 1 each so far.\n\nNext, I'll move on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I think I should calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each place separately. \n\nStarting with the tens place for two-digit numbers: The tens digit can be from 1 to 9. For the tens digit being 4, the numbers would be from 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are from 80 to 89, which is another 10 numbers, so 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers: The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each tens digit. So, for each ten's group (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. Since there are 9 groups (10-19 up to 90-99), the digit 4 appears 9 times in the units place. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the units place. \n\nWait, let me check that. From 10-19, the units digits go 0-9, so 4 is in 14, and 8 is in 18. That's one each. Then 20-29: 24 and 28. Again, one each. So, for each of the 9 tens groups, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 9 times each. \n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. Similarly, the total number of 8's is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. So, in two-digit pages, both 4 and 8 appear 19 times each. That means so far, the counts are 1 (single-digit) + 19 (two-digit) = 20 for both 4 and 8.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because each page number has a hundreds, tens, and units place. I need to consider each place separately again.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's see how 4 and 8 appear here. \n\n- When the hundreds digit is 4, the numbers range from 400 to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the hundreds digit is only 1, 2, 3, or 4, not 8. So, 8's count in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be from 0 to 9 for each hundreds group. Let's see how often 4 and 8 appear here.\n\nFor each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, for each hundreds group, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 140-149 for the 100-199 group). Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 180-189). \n\nBut wait, the last hundreds group is 400-488, which only goes up to 488. So, for the 400-488 group, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, for the 400-488 group, the digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but the digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. Hmm, that might affect the count. Let me think carefully.\n\nWait, for each hundreds group except the last one, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9, so 10 possibilities. But in the last group (400-488), the tens digit goes up to 8, because 488 is the last page. So, the tens digit in 400-488 is from 0 to 8, which is 9 possibilities. So, for 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because in the 400-488 group, the tens digit for 8 would be from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, for the tens place:\n\n- In 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: each of these has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 and 10 where it's 8.\n- In 400-488: the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. The tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's in the tens place across all three-digit numbers would be 3 groups * 10 (for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) + 10 (for 400-488) = 3*10 +10 = 40.\n\nSimilarly, the total number of 8's in the tens place would be 3 groups *10 +9 = 39.\n\nWait, let me check that again. For each of the first three hundreds groups (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times each, so 3*10=30. Then in 400-488, it's 10 times (440-449). So total 40.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place: each of the first three hundreds groups has 10 times, so 3*10=30. In 400-488, it's 9 times (480-488). So total 30+9=39.\n\nOkay, so 40 4's and 39 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each combination of hundreds and tens digits. So, for each hundreds group and each tens group, the units digit 4 and 8 each appear once every 10 numbers.\n\nLet's calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in the units place across all three-digit numbers.\n\nFirst, for the first three hundreds groups (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each has 100 numbers. In each hundred, for each tens group (0-9), the units digit 4 appears once, and 8 appears once. So, for each hundred, that's 10 (tens groups) *1 (units digit) = 10 times each. So, for three hundreds, that's 3*10=30 times each for 4 and 8.\n\nNow, for the 400-488 group, which has 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). Each tens group in this range is from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). For each tens group, the units digit 4 and 8 each appear once, except when the tens group is 8, where the units digit can only go up to 8, so in 480-488, the units digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in the tens group 8, the units digit 8 appears only once (at 488), but the units digit 4 appears once (at 484). Wait, no, actually, for each tens group, the units digit cycles through 0-9, except for the last tens group in 400-488, which is 8, where the units digit only goes up to 8.\n\nWait, so for tens groups 0-7 in 400-488, each has 10 units digits, so 4 and 8 each appear once per tens group. For tens group 8, units digits go from 0-8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, in total, for 400-488:\n\n- For tens groups 0-7: 8 tens groups, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8 in units place. So, 8*1=8 for 4 and 8 each.\n- For tens group 8: 1 4 and 1 8.\nSo, total in 400-488: 8+1=9 4's and 8+1=9 8's in the units place.\n\nWait, that seems off because 400-488 has 89 numbers, which is 8 full tens groups (0-7) of 10 numbers each, and then the 8th tens group (80-88) has 9 numbers. So, for each tens group 0-7, units digits 0-9, so 4 and 8 each appear once per tens group. That's 8 tens groups, so 8*1=8 for each digit. Then, in tens group 8 (480-488), units digits go from 0-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total in units place for 400-488: 8+1=9 for 4 and 8 each.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 480-488 is 9 numbers, so units digits 0-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, yes, that's correct. So, in 400-488, units place contributes 9 4's and 9 8's.\n\nWait, but that's 9 each, but 400-488 has 89 numbers, which is 8 full tens groups (0-7) and one partial (8). So, for units digits, each full tens group contributes 1 4 and 1 8, so 8*1=8 each. The partial tens group (8) contributes 1 4 and 1 8, so total 9 each. That makes sense.\n\nSo, total units place counts:\n\n- For 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: 30 each (3*10).\n- For 400-488: 9 each.\n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 30 +9=39.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: 30+9=39.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, in the units place across all three-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear 39 times each.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. For each of the first three hundreds groups, each has 10 occurrences of 4 and 8 in the units place per hundred, so 3*10=30 each. Then, in 400-488, we have 9 each, so total 39 each. That seems correct.\n\nSo, summarizing the three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 4's, 0 8's.\n- Tens place: 40 4's, 39 8's.\n- Units place: 39 4's, 39 8's.\n\nSo, total in three-digit numbers:\n\n4's: 89 +40 +39 = 168.\n\n8's: 0 +39 +39 =78.\n\nWait, let me add that again. 89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (units) = 168 for 4's. For 8's, 0 (hundreds) +39 (tens) +39 (units) =78.\n\nSo, now, adding up all the counts from single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers:\n\n4's:\n\n- Single-digit:1\n- Two-digit:19\n- Three-digit:168\nTotal:1+19=20; 20+168=188.\n\n8's:\n\n- Single-digit:1\n- Two-digit:19\n- Three-digit:78\nTotal:1+19=20; 20+78=98.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's printed is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me go through each part again.\n\nSingle-digit:\n\n- 4:1\n- 8:1\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- Tens place:40-49 (10 4's), 80-89 (10 8's).\n- Units place: each ten's group has one 4 and one 8, so 9 ten's groups, so 9 each.\nTotal for two-digit: 10+9=19 for 4's, same for 8's.\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. 8 doesn't appear in hundreds place, so 0.\n- Tens place: For 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each has 10 4's and 10 8's in tens place. So, 3*10=30 each. For 400-488, tens digit 4 appears in 440-449 (10 numbers), so 10 4's. Tens digit 8 appears in 480-488 (9 numbers), so 9 8's. So, total tens place: 4's=30+10=40, 8's=30+9=39.\n- Units place: For 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each has 10 4's and 10 8's in units place, so 3*10=30 each. For 400-488, units place 4's: in each tens group (0-7), 1 per group, so 8 groups *1=8, plus in tens group 8, 484, so 1 more, total 9. Similarly, units place 8's: 8 groups *1=8, plus 488, so 1 more, total 9. So, units place: 30+9=39 each.\n\nSo, three-digit counts:\n\n4's: 89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (units)=168.\n\n8's:0 (hundreds) +39 (tens) +39 (units)=78.\n\nAdding single and two-digit:\n\n4's:1+19=20; 20+168=188.\n\n8's:1+19=20; 20+78=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nI think that's the answer. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. Maybe I should check the three-digit counts again.\n\nIn three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Correct.\n- Tens place: 3 hundreds groups (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each contribute 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 30 each. Then, 400-488: tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, 30+10=40 for 4's, 30+9=39 for 8's. Correct.\n- Units place: 3 hundreds groups contribute 30 each for 4's and 8's. Then, 400-488: 9 each, so 39 each. Correct.\n\nYes, so the total counts seem accurate. Therefore, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Single-Digit Pages (1-9):**\n   - Digit 4 appears once (page 4).\n   - Digit 8 appears once (page 8).\n   - Count: 4's = 1, 8's = 1.\n\n2. **Two-Digit Pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - 4 appears in 40-49: 10 times.\n     - 8 appears in 80-89: 10 times.\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - For each ten's group (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place.\n     - Total: 9 groups \u00d7 1 = 9 times each.\n   - Total for two-digit pages:\n     - 4's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n     - 8's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\n3. **Three-Digit Pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - 4 appears in 400-488: 89 times.\n     - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - For 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: 10 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n     - Total for these groups: 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 each.\n     - For 400-488: 4 appears in 440-449 (10 times), 8 appears in 480-488 (9 times).\n     - Total: 4's = 30 + 10 = 40, 8's = 30 + 9 = 39.\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - For 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: 10 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place.\n     - Total: 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 each.\n     - For 400-488: 9 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place.\n     - Total: 30 + 9 = 39 each.\n   - **Total for three-digit pages:**\n     - 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n     - 8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n\n4. **Overall Total:**\n   - 4's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n   - 8's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering the single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digits 4 and 8 each appear exactly once. So, for single-digit pages, the count for both 4 and 8 is 1. Therefore, the difference here is 1 - 1 = 0. So, no difference yet.\n\nNext, I'll move on to the two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nStarting with the tens place: For two-digit numbers, the tens digit can be from 1 to 9. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, the numbers would be 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place, the numbers would be 80-89, which is also 10 numbers, so 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the units place: In the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in every block of 10 numbers. So, for two-digit numbers, from 10 to 99, there are 9 blocks of 10 (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99). In each block, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 9 times in total for 4. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once in each block, so 9 times in total for 8.\n\nWait, but hold on, I think I made a mistake here. Because in the two-digit numbers, the units place for 4 and 8 would each appear 9 times, right? Because from 10-19, the units digit 4 is 14, and 8 is 18, and this repeats for each ten. So, yes, 9 times each.\n\nSo, adding up the tens and units places for two-digit numbers: For 4, it's 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times. For 8, it's 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times. So, again, the difference here is 19 - 19 = 0. So, still no difference.\n\nNow, moving on to the three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because each page number has a hundreds place, a tens place, and a units place. I need to count the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each of these places.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book has 488 pages. So, from 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; from 200-299, it's 2; from 300-399, it's 3; and from 400-488, it's 4.\n\nFor the digit 4 in the hundreds place, it appears from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nFor the digit 8 in the hundreds place, looking at the range 100-488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. Therefore, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place in the three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be from 0 to 9 for each hundred. But since our upper limit is 488, the last hundred (400-488) has tens digits from 0 to 8 (because 488 is the last page). Wait, no, actually, the tens digit in 400-488 can go up to 8 because 480-488 is part of that range. So, the tens digit can be 0-9 for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 0-8 for 400-488.\n\nSo, let's break it down:\n\nFor 4 in the tens place:\n\n- In 100-199: The tens digit is 4 for 140-149. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n- Similarly, in 200-299: 240-249, 10 times.\n- In 300-399: 340-349, 10 times.\n- In 400-488: The tens digit can be 0-8. So, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, 10 times.\n\nSo, total for 4 in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 times.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place:\n\n- In 100-199: 180-189, 10 times.\n- In 200-299: 280-289, 10 times.\n- In 300-399: 380-389, 10 times.\n- In 400-488: The tens digit can be 0-8, so 480-488 is part of this. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), but the tens digit here is 8, so that's 9 times (since 488 is the last page). Wait, but actually, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place for 400-488.\n\nSo, adding up: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. For 400-488, the tens digit can be up to 8, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, so 9 times. So, yes, 39 times total for 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in the three-digit numbers. The units digit can be from 0 to 9 for each combination of hundreds and tens digits. So, for each hundred, each tens digit, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, for each hundred, each tens digit, the digit 4 and 8 will each appear once in the units place.\n\nSo, let's calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in the units place across all three-digit numbers up to 488.\n\nFirst, for the hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, and 4 (but 4 only goes up to 488). Let's break it down:\n\nFor hundreds digits 1, 2, 3:\n\nEach of these has full sets of tens digits (0-9) and units digits (0-9). So, for each hundred, there are 10 tens digits, each with 10 units digits. So, for each hundred, the units digit 4 appears 10 times (once for each ten), and similarly for 8.\n\nSo, for hundreds 1, 2, 3:\n\n- Each contributes 10 (tens) * 1 (units digit 4) = 10 times for 4.\n- Similarly, 10 times for 8.\n\nSo, for three hundreds (1, 2, 3), that's 3 * 10 = 30 times for 4, and 3 * 10 = 30 times for 8.\n\nNow, for the hundreds digit 4 (400-488):\n\nHere, the tens digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, for each tens digit, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place.\n\nSo, number of tens digits here is 9 (0-8). Therefore, for units digit 4: 9 times, and for units digit 8: 9 times.\n\nWait, but wait, when the tens digit is 8, the units digit goes up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for tens digit 8, the units digits go from 0-8, meaning 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, actually, even though the units digits stop at 8, both 4 and 8 still appear once in that last tens group.\n\nTherefore, for hundreds digit 4, units digit 4 appears 9 times (once for each tens digit 0-8), and same for 8.\n\nWait, but let me check: For each tens digit from 0-8, the units digit 4 appears once, so 9 times. Similarly, units digit 8 appears once for each tens digit, so 9 times. So, yes, 9 each.\n\nTherefore, total for units place in three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4 appears 30 (from 1-3 hundreds) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39 times.\n- 8 appears 30 (from 1-3 hundreds) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39 times.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because earlier in the tens place, 4 appeared 40 times and 8 appeared 39 times. But in the units place, both are 39 times. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the units place calculation.\n\nWait, let me think again. For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each has 10 tens digits, each with 10 units digits. So, for each hundred, units digit 4 appears 10 times (once per ten), so 3 * 10 = 30. Similarly for 8.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4 (400-488): The tens digits go from 0 to 8, which is 9 tens digits. For each of these, the units digit 4 appears once, so 9 times. Same for 8: 9 times.\n\nSo, total units digit counts:\n\n- 4: 30 + 9 = 39\n- 8: 30 + 9 = 39\n\nSo, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 39 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences for each digit across all places.\n\nStarting with 4:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 times (from 400-488)\n- Tens place: 40 times (as calculated earlier)\n- Units place: 39 times\n\nTotal for 4: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 times.\n\nNow for 8:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\n- Tens place: 39 times (as calculated earlier)\n- Units place: 39 times\n\nTotal for 8: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78 times.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8. Earlier, I thought it was 39 times, but let me confirm.\n\nIn the tens place for three-digit numbers:\n\n- For hundreds 1, 2, 3: Each contributes 10 times (e.g., 180-189, etc.), so 3 * 10 = 30.\n- For hundreds 4: Tens digits go up to 8, so 480-488. The units digits go up to 8, but the tens digit is 8, so the numbers are 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nSo, total for 8 in tens place: 30 + 9 = 39 times. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, as calculated, 39 times.\n\nSo, total for 8: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78 times.\n\nNow, total for 4 is 168, and for 8 is 78. So, the difference is 168 - 78 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in each place.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times (from 400-488 inclusive). That seems correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40. That's correct.\n\nIn the units place, 30 (from 1-3 hundreds) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39. Correct.\n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nFor 8:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0\n- Tens place: 30 (from 1-3 hundreds) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39\n- Units place: 30 (from 1-3 hundreds) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39\nTotal: 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nSo, 168 - 78 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other digits. For example, in the two-digit numbers, we had 19 each, and single-digit 1 each. So, total for 4: 19 (two-digit) + 1 (single-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 19 + 1 + 168 = 188? Wait, no, wait a second. I think I messed up.\n\nWait, no, because when I broke it down earlier, I considered single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit separately. But in the three-digit numbers, I included the hundreds, tens, and units places, which already include all three-digit numbers. But the single-digit and two-digit numbers are separate.\n\nWait, hold on. I think I made a mistake in my initial breakdown. Let me correct this.\n\nEarlier, I considered single-digit (1-9), two-digit (10-99), and three-digit (100-488). But when I calculated the three-digit numbers, I included all the 100-488, which includes the hundreds, tens, and units digits. However, when I calculated the two-digit numbers, I considered 10-99, which is correct.\n\nBut when I calculated the total for 4 and 8, I only considered three-digit numbers, but I also need to add the counts from single-digit and two-digit numbers.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because in the three-digit calculation, I included all the digits from 100-488, which includes the hundreds, tens, and units places. But the single-digit and two-digit numbers are separate and were already accounted for in their respective calculations.\n\nWait, no, I think I confused myself. Let me start over and structure this properly.\n\nTotal digits to consider: 1-488.\n\nWe can break this down into:\n\n1. Single-digit pages: 1-9\n2. Two-digit pages: 10-99\n3. Three-digit pages: 100-488\n\nWe need to count the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each of these ranges.\n\nFirst, single-digit pages (1-9):\n\n- 4 appears once (page 4)\n- 8 appears once (page 8)\nSo, counts so far:\n- 4: 1\n- 8: 1\n\nTwo-digit pages (10-99):\n\nEach two-digit number has a tens place and a units place.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For 4 in the tens place: 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n- For 8 in the tens place: 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- For 4 in the units place: In each ten (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), 4 appears once, so 9 times (since there are 9 tens).\n- For 8 in the units place: Similarly, 9 times.\n\nSo, total for two-digit pages:\n\n- 4: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n- 8: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n\nAdding to previous counts:\n\n- 4: 1 + 19 = 20\n- 8: 1 + 19 = 20\n\nNow, three-digit pages (100-488):\n\nEach three-digit number has hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place in this range.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For 4 in the tens place: In each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times per hundred except for 400-488, where it appears 10 times (440-449). Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, total for 4 in tens place: 3 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each contribute 10, and 400-488 contributes 10, so 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\n- For 8 in the tens place: Similarly, in 100-199: 180-189 (10 times), 200-299: 280-289 (10 times), 300-399: 380-389 (10 times), and in 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total for 8 in tens place: 3 * 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- For 4 in the units place: In each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), for each tens digit (0-9), 4 appears once in the units place. So, 10 tens digits * 1 occurrence = 10 per hundred. So, 3 hundreds * 10 = 30.\n\nIn 400-488, the tens digits go from 0-8, so for each of these 9 tens digits, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 9 times.\n\nThus, total for 4 in units place: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\n- For 8 in the units place: Similarly, in each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), 10 times per hundred, so 3 * 10 = 30.\n\nIn 400-488, for each tens digit from 0-8, 8 appears once in the units place, so 9 times.\n\nTotal for 8 in units place: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nNow, summing up for three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4: Hundreds (89) + Tens (40) + Units (39) = 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n- 8: Hundreds (0) + Tens (39) + Units (39) = 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nAdding this to the previous totals:\n\n- 4: 20 (from single and two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188\n- 8: 20 (from single and two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98\n\nWait, but wait a second. Earlier, when I considered two-digit numbers, I added 19 each, and single-digit 1 each, giving 20 each. Then, in three-digit numbers, I added 168 for 4 and 78 for 8. So, total for 4 is 20 + 168 = 188, and for 8, 20 + 78 = 98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 90, but now I'm getting the same number. So, I think that's correct.\n\nBut let me just cross-verify. Another way to approach this is to calculate the total number of 4's and 8's in each digit place across all page numbers.\n\nLet's consider each digit place separately.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the units place?\n\nIn each block of 10 numbers, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, for 488 numbers, there are 48 full blocks of 10 (since 48 * 10 = 480), and then 8 more numbers (481-488).\n\nSo, for units digit:\n\n- 4 appears 48 times (once per block) + 1 more if 484 is included. Wait, 481-488: 484 is within this range, so 4 appears once more. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears 48 times (once per block) + 1 more if 488 is included. Since 488 is within the range, 8 appears once more. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier count. Wait, in the units place, I had 39 for 4 and 39 for 8 in three-digit numbers, plus in two-digit numbers, 9 each, and single-digit 1 each. Wait, perhaps this method is different.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to use this block method.\n\nTotal numbers: 488.\n\nNumber of complete decades (blocks of 10): 48 (since 48*10=480), and then 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n\nIn each complete decade, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place, so 48 times each.\n\nIn the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n\nSo, total units digit counts:\n\n- 4: 48 + 1 = 49\n- 8: 48 + 1 = 49\n\nHmm, that's different from my earlier count of 39 each. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's see.\n\nIn the three-digit numbers, I calculated units digits as 39 for both 4 and 8, but according to this block method, it's 49 each. That suggests an error in my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I didn't account for all the units digits correctly. Let me try again.\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers (100-488), how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the units place?\n\nFor each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the units digit cycles 0-9 for each tens digit.\n\nSo, for each hundred, each tens digit, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place.\n\nSo, for 100-199: 10 tens digits (0-9), each with 10 units digits, so 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8.\n\nSimilarly, 200-299: same, 10 each.\n\n300-399: same, 10 each.\n\n400-488: Here, the tens digits go from 0-8, so 9 tens digits. For each, the units digits go from 0-9, except for the last tens digit (8), where units go up to 8.\n\nSo, for 400-488:\n\n- For tens digits 0-7: Each has 10 units digits, so 4 and 8 each appear 10 times per tens digit. So, 8 tens digits (0-7) contribute 8 * 10 = 80 each for 4 and 8.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, for each tens digit, units digits 0-9, so 4 and 8 each appear once per tens digit. So, for tens digits 0-7, that's 8 tens digits, each contributing 1 occurrence of 4 and 1 of 8. So, 8 times each.\n\nThen, for tens digit 8: Units digits go from 0-8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, total for 400-488:\n\n- 4: 8 (from tens 0-7) + 1 (from tens 8) = 9\n- 8: 8 (from tens 0-7) + 1 (from tens 8) = 9\n\nTherefore, total units digit counts for three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39\n- 8: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n\nAdding the two-digit and single-digit units digits:\n\n- From 1-99: 9 (two-digit) + 1 (single-digit) = 10 each\nWait, no, in the two-digit numbers, units digits for 4 and 8 each appeared 9 times (from 10-99). Plus, single-digit pages 4 and 8 each appeared once. So, total units digits for 4: 9 + 1 = 10, and same for 8.\n\nSo, total units digits:\n\n- 4: 10 (from 1-99) + 39 (from 100-488) = 49\n- 8: 10 + 39 = 49\n\nWhich matches the block method. So, I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought it was 39 each. It's actually 49 each.\n\nSo, going back, let's recalculate the total occurrences.\n\nStarting over:\n\nSingle-digit (1-9):\n\n- 4: 1\n- 8: 1\n\nTwo-digit (10-99):\n\n- Tens place: 10 each\n- Units place: 9 each\nTotal: 19 each\n\nThree-digit (100-488):\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 for 4, 0 for 8\n- Tens place: 40 for 4, 39 for 8\n- Units place: 39 for 4, 39 for 8 (but wait, now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 49 each when including two-digit and single-digit, but in three-digit alone, it's 39 each)\n\nWait, perhaps I need to separate the counts properly.\n\nWait, in three-digit numbers, the units digits for 4 and 8 are 39 each, as calculated earlier. But when considering the entire range (1-488), the units digits for 4 and 8 are 49 each, as per the block method. So, that suggests that in three-digit numbers, the units digits for 4 and 8 are 39 each, and in two-digit and single-digit, they are 10 each (from 1-99). So, total units digits: 39 + 10 = 49 each.\n\nTherefore, to correctly calculate the total occurrences, I should sum across all digit places:\n\nFor 4:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89\n- Tens place: 40\n- Units place: 49\nTotal: 89 + 40 + 49 = 178\n\nFor 8:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0\n- Tens place: 39\n- Units place: 49\nTotal: 0 + 39 + 49 = 88\n\nWait, but earlier using the block method, units digits were 49 each, but according to the three-digit calculation, units digits in three-digit numbers were 39 each, plus 10 each from 1-99, totaling 49 each.\n\nSo, total for 4: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 49 (units) = 178\n\nFor 8: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 49 (units) = 88\n\nThus, the difference is 178 - 88 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 90, but when I added 188 - 98, I also got 90. So, perhaps 90 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the tens place counts again.\n\nIn three-digit numbers, for the tens place:\n\n- For 4: 40 times\n- For 8: 39 times\n\nWhich seems correct because in 400-488, the tens digit 8 only goes up to 488, so 9 numbers instead of 10, hence 39 times.\n\nSo, yes, 40 for 4 and 39 for 8 in the tens place.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 49 each, as per the block method.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nSo, total for 4: 89 + 40 + 49 = 178\n\nTotal for 8: 0 + 39 + 49 = 88\n\nDifference: 178 - 88 = 90.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - '4' appears once.\n   - '8' appears once.\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** '4' appears 10 times (40-49), '8' appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - **Units place:** '4' appears 9 times, '8' appears 9 times.\n   - Total for two-digit pages: '4' = 19, '8' = 19.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** '4' appears 89 times (400-488), '8' does not appear.\n   - **Tens place:** '4' appears 40 times, '8' appears 39 times.\n   - **Units place:** '4' appears 49 times, '8' appears 49 times (considering all pages up to 488).\n\n4. **Total counts:**\n   - '4': 1 (single-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 49 (units) = 178.\n   - '8': 1 (single-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 39 (tens) + 49 (units) = 108.\n\n5. **Difference:** 178 (number of '4's) - 108 (number of '8's) = 70.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{70}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each place value separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each of these 48 sets, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the extra numbers from 481-488, does the units digit include a 4? Let me check: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. Yes, 484 has a 4 in the units place. So that's one more. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for every 100 numbers, specifically from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there? Well, from 0-488, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 5 * 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me do that math: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, for every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of 10 and 8 extra numbers (481-488). Each set contributes 1 8, so 48 times. Now, in the extra numbers, 481-488, the units digits are 1 through 8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So that's one more. So total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for every 100 numbers, specifically in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, so that's 4 blocks * 10 = 40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me double-check. For units place, 48 full tens with 1 each, plus 1 in the extra 8 numbers, so 49. For tens place, 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9, so 4*10 + 9 = 49. Yep, that adds up.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, right? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So that's correct. And for the 8's, since the book ends at 488, there are no 800-899 pages, so no 8's in the hundreds place. So, yes, 0 there.\n\nAnother check: Let me recount the 4's in the tens place. It's 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nFor the 8's in the tens place, it's 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So that's five blocks, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So 4*10 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nUnits place for both digits: 48 full sets of 10, plus the extra numbers where the digit appears once each if applicable. For 4's, in the extra 481-488, 484 has a 4 in the units, so 1 more. For 8's, 488 has an 8 in the units, so 1 more. So both have 49 in units place.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188. 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 98. Difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full sets of 10 (48 \u00d7 1 = 48) plus one more in 484, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 5 blocks of 10 (40-49, 140-149, etc.), each contributing 10, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 numbers from 400-488, each with a 4, totaling 89.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full sets of 10 (48 \u00d7 1 = 48) plus one more in 488, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 full blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, etc.) and 9 numbers in 480-488, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in the range 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48 full cycles, and then there's a remainder of 8. In each full cycle, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 doesn't appear again in the units place. So, total 4's in the units place: 48.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For each block of 100 numbers, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, in each block of 100, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. How many full hundreds are there in 488? There are four full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so there are four full hundreds (1-400) and then 401-488. \n\nWait, let me correct that. From 1-488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, but the tens digit is part of the two-digit part. So, in each hundred block, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, for each hundred, 10 times 4 in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds? Wait, no, because 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So, actually, how many full hundreds are there? From 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400: that's four full hundreds. Then, 401-488 is another 88 pages. So, in each of the four full hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, 4 times 10 is 40. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in 401-409, the tens digit is 0; 410-419, it's 1; 420-429, 2; 430-439, 3; 440-449, 4; 450-459, 5; 460-469, 6; 470-479,7; 480-488,8. So, in the 401-488 block, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 (from the four full hundreds) + 10 (from the partial hundred) = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the pages 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages, so the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Wait, but wait, page 400 is the first page with 4 in the hundreds place, and it goes up to 488. So, that's 89 pages. So, 89 times 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, each of those 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Then, in the tens place, as I calculated, 50. And in the units place, 48. So, 89 + 50 = 139, plus 48 is 187. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. Starting with the units place: similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full cycles, with a remainder of 8. So, 48 times 8 in the units place. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once more in the units place (at 488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: Similar to 4's, in each block of 100, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, in each block, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for four full hundreds (1-400), that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so that's 9 times 8 in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so total 98. \n\nNow, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. \n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me verify each step again.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nUnits place: From 1-488, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full times, and in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 4 doesn't appear again. So, 48 times.\n\nTens place: In each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, four full hundreds: 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\nUnits place: Similarly, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 times, plus in the last partial set (481-488), 8 appears once at 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: In each hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, four full hundreds: 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), so 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0, as before.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 89 seems like a large difference. Let me think if I counted correctly.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to consider each digit place separately and calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) = 48, plus if the last digit is >=4, but since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is greater than 4, so we add 1 more? Wait, no, that's for counting how many times a digit appears in a range. Wait, actually, the formula is:\n\nFor units digit, the number of times a digit d appears is floor((n + 10 - d)/10). Wait, maybe I should use a more accurate method.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use a formula for counting digit occurrences. The standard approach is to consider each digit position separately and calculate how many times each digit appears.\n\nFor a given position (units, tens, hundreds), the count can be calculated as follows:\n\nLet's denote the current digit position as i (starting from 0 for units, 1 for tens, 2 for hundreds, etc.), and the divisor as 10^(i+1), the higher divisor as 10^i.\n\nFor each digit position, the count of digit d is:\n\nhigher = n / (divisor * 10)\ncurrent = (n / divisor) % 10\nlower = n % divisor\n\nif current > d: count += (higher + 1) * divisor\nelif current == d: count += higher * divisor + lower + 1\nelse: count += higher * divisor\n\nBut since we're dealing with digits 4 and 8, let's apply this formula for each digit position.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of 4's:\n\nFor units place (i=0):\n\ndivisor = 10^1 = 10\nhigher = 488 / 10 = 48\ncurrent = (488 / 10) % 10 = 8\nlower = 488 % 10 = 8\n\nSince current (8) > 4:\ncount += (48 + 1) * 1 = 49 * 1 = 49\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, discrepancy here. Let me check.\n\nWait, according to this formula, for units place, the count of 4's is 49, but earlier I thought it was 48. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, let's list the units digits from 1-488. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. How many are there? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1= 48 +1=49. So, yes, 49 times. So, I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought it was 48. So, the correct count for units place 4's is 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place, using the formula:\n\nhigher = 488 /10=48\ncurrent=(488/10)%10=8\nlower=488%10=8\n\nSince current (8) >=8, so count += (48 +1)*1=49. So, 49 times, which matches my earlier count.\n\nSo, I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought units place 4's were 48. Actually, it's 49. So, that changes things.\n\nLet me recalculate the total number of 4's and 8's.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49\nTens place: Let's use the formula again.\n\nFor tens place (i=1):\n\ndivisor = 100\nhigher = 488 / 100 = 4\ncurrent = (488 / 100) % 10 = 8\nlower = 488 % 100 = 88\n\nSince current (8) >4:\ncount += (4 +1) *10=5*10=50\n\nSo, tens place 4's: 50\n\nHundreds place (i=2):\n\ndivisor=1000\nhigher=488/1000=0\ncurrent=(488/1000)%10=0\nlower=488%1000=488\n\nSince current (0) <4:\ncount +=0*100=0\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times. So, there's a discrepancy here. The formula might not be capturing that correctly because it's considering the hundreds digit as 0, but in reality, the hundreds digit is 4 for numbers 400-488.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misapplying the formula. Let me check the formula again.\n\nThe formula for the hundreds place (i=2):\n\ndivisor=1000\nhigher=488 / 1000=0\ncurrent=(488 / 1000) %10=0\nlower=488 %1000=488\n\nSince current (0) <4, count += higher * divisor=0*100=0\n\nBut that's not correct because in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. So, perhaps the formula isn't directly applicable here because the hundreds digit is 4, which is higher than the current digit (0). Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the formula.\n\nWait, the formula is for counting how many times a specific digit d appears in a particular position. So, in this case, d=4, and we're looking at the hundreds place.\n\nWait, let me try to apply the formula correctly.\n\nFor the hundreds place (i=2), d=4:\n\nhigher = 488 / (10^(2+1)) = 488 / 1000 = 0\ncurrent = (488 / 1000) % 10 = 0\nlower = 488 % 1000 = 488\n\nSince current (0) < d (4):\ncount += higher * 100 = 0 * 100 = 0\n\nBut this is incorrect because in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times from 400-488. So, perhaps the formula isn't directly applicable here because it's considering the hundreds digit as 0, but in reality, the hundreds digit can be 4, which is greater than 0.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is intended for digits beyond the highest digit in the number. Since 488 is a three-digit number, the hundreds digit can be 0-4, but when using the formula for d=4, higher is 0, current is 0, which is less than d, so it returns 0. But in reality, the hundreds digit is 4 for 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, the formula isn't capturing that. Maybe I need a different approach for the hundreds place.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1 =89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times.\n\nSo, for the hundreds place, 4's:89\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89)=49+50=99+89=188\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was 187, but now it's 188. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let's recount:\n\nUnits place:49\nTens place:50\nHundreds place:89\nTotal:49+50=99; 99+89=188\n\nSo, 188 4's.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\nUsing the formula for each digit place.\n\nUnits place:\n\ndivisor=10\nhigher=488/10=48\ncurrent=(488/10)%10=8\nlower=488%10=8\n\nSince current (8) >=8:\ncount += (48 +1)*1=49\n\nTens place:\n\ndivisor=100\nhigher=488/100=4\ncurrent=(488/100)%10=8\nlower=488%100=88\n\nSince current (8) >=8:\ncount += (4 +1)*10=5*10=50\n\nHundreds place:\n\ndivisor=1000\nhigher=488/1000=0\ncurrent=(488/1000)%10=0\nlower=488%1000=488\n\nSince current (0) <8:\ncount += higher *100=0*100=0\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (0)=99\n\nWait, so 8's total is 99.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 8's were 98. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let's check the tens place for 8's. Using the formula, it's 50, but earlier I thought it was 49.\n\nWait, let's list the tens digits where 8 appears. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in the ranges:\n\n80-89: 10 numbers\n180-189:10\n280-289:10\n380-389:10\n480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, 10+10+10+10+9=49\n\nWait, so according to this, the tens place 8's are 49, not 50. So, the formula gave 50, but actual count is 49. So, perhaps the formula overcounts by 1 in this case.\n\nWait, let me check the formula again. For the tens place (i=1), d=8:\n\nhigher=488 / 100=4\ncurrent=(488 /100)%10=8\nlower=488%100=88\n\nSince current >=d (8 >=8), count += (4 +1)*10=5*10=50\n\nBut in reality, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, the formula counts 50, but actual is 49. So, perhaps the formula isn't perfect when the current digit is exactly d and the lower part is less than 10.\n\nWait, in the formula, when current ==d, it adds higher*divisor + lower +1. So, in this case, higher=4, divisor=10, lower=88.\n\nSo, count +=4*10 +88 +1=40+88+1=129? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, I think I'm misapplying the formula.\n\nWait, the formula is:\n\nif current > d: count += (higher +1)*divisor\nelif current ==d: count += higher*divisor + lower +1\nelse: count += higher*divisor\n\nSo, in this case, current=8, d=8, so we use the elif case:\n\ncount += higher*divisor + lower +1\n\nhigher=4, divisor=10, lower=88\n\nSo, 4*10 +88 +1=40+88+1=129\n\nWait, that can't be right because the tens digit 8 can't appear 129 times in 488 numbers. So, I must be misunderstanding the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is intended for counting the number of times a specific digit appears in a specific position across all numbers up to n. So, for the tens place, d=8, the count would be:\n\nhigher = floor(488 / 100) =4\ncurrent = floor(488 /10) %10=8\nlower =488 %10=8\n\nSo, if current >8: count += (higher +1)*10\nif current ==8: count += higher*10 + lower +1\nif current <8: count += higher*10\n\nBut wait, current is 8, which is equal to d=8, so count +=4*10 +8 +1=40+8+1=49\n\nAh, I see. Earlier, I think I misapplied the formula by using lower=88, but actually, lower is 488%100=88, but in the formula, it's lower modulo 10, which is 8. Wait, no, the formula as I read it uses lower as is, not modulo anything. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the formula.\n\nWait, let me look up the correct digit counting formula.\n\nUpon checking, the standard formula for counting the number of times a digit d appears in the i-th position (units, tens, hundreds) up to number n is:\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- higher = n / (divisor * 10)\n- current = (n / divisor) % 10\n- lower = n % divisor\n\nwhere divisor is 10^i.\n\nThen:\n- If current > d: count += (higher + 1) * divisor\n- If current == d: count += higher * divisor + lower + 1\n- If current < d: count += higher * divisor\n\nSo, applying this correctly:\n\nFor tens place (i=1), d=8:\n\ndivisor =10^(1+1)=100\nhigher =488 / 100=4\ncurrent=(488 /10) %10=8\nlower=488%100=88\n\nSince current ==d (8==8):\ncount += higher * divisor + lower +1=4*100 +88 +1=400+88+1=489\n\nWait, that can't be right because the tens digit can't appear 489 times in 488 numbers. Clearly, I'm misunderstanding the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm using the wrong divisor. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, for the tens place (i=1), divisor should be 10^(1)=10, not 100.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nFor each digit position i (starting from 0 for units), divisor is 10^(i+1), and higher is n / divisor.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to define divisor as 10^i for the current digit, and higher_divisor as 10^(i+1).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the divisor. Let me try again.\n\nFor the tens place (i=1):\n\ndivisor =10^1=10\nhigher =488 / (10*10)=488/100=4\ncurrent=(488 /10) %10=48%10=8\nlower=488 %10=8\n\nSo, since current ==d (8==8):\ncount += higher * divisor + lower +1=4*10 +8 +1=40+8+1=49\n\nAh, that makes sense. So, the correct count is 49 for tens place 8's.\n\nSo, using the formula correctly, for tens place 8's, it's 49.\n\nSo, total 8's:\n\nUnits place:49\nTens place:49\nHundreds place:0\nTotal:49+49=98\n\nWait, so earlier when I used the formula, I thought it was 50, but actually, it's 49. So, the correct total for 8's is 98.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's:\n\nUnits place:49\nTens place:50\nHundreds place:89\nTotal:49+50=99+89=188\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 =90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 89. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, let me recount the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's.\n\nSo, 4's total:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n\n8's total:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98\n\nDifference:188 -98=90\n\nWait, so the correct difference is 90, not 89 as I initially thought. So, I must have made a mistake in the hundreds place earlier.\n\nWait, let me confirm the hundreds place for 4's:\n\nFrom 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 -400 +1=89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, yes, 89.\n\nSo, 4's:49+50+89=188\n\n8's:49+49=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nSo, the answer should be 90.\n\nWait, but earlier when I used the formula for 4's in the hundreds place, I thought it was 0, but that was incorrect. The correct count is 89.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. There are 48 full cycles (480 numbers) and 8 remaining numbers (481-488). In the remaining numbers, 4 doesn't appear. So, 48 times.\n   - **Tens Place:** In each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For four full hundreds (1-400), that's 40 times. In 401-488, 4 appears in 440-449, adding 10. Total: 50 times.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times.\n   - **Total '4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** Every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. There are 48 full cycles and 8 remaining numbers (481-488), where 8 appears once. Total: 49 times.\n   - **Tens Place:** In each hundred, 8 appears 10 times. For four full hundreds, that's 40 times. In 401-488, 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. Total: 49 times.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 187\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 187 - 98 = 89\n\n**Answer:**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 89. \n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. Dividing 488 by 10 gives me 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 488 include a 4 in the units place? The last number with a 4 in the units place would be 484, which is within 488. So, the units place contributes 48 instances of the digit 4. \n\nNext, the tens place: Here, the digit 4 appears in a block of 10 numbers. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block of 100 numbers has exactly 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, for each hundred, there are 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. That's 4 times 10, which is 40. Now, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 from 440-449. That's another 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 more. So, total tens place 4's would be 40 + 10 = 50. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. From 1-100, the tens digit 4 is from 40-49: 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149: another 10, so that's two hundreds. Wait, actually, 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400: that's four hundreds. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 4 is from 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total is 40 + 10 = 50. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 more 4's. \n\nAdding up all the 4's: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. From 1 to 488, that's 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8. The last group is 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the 8 in the units place appears in 488. So, 48 instances. Wait, 488 is included, so yes, 48 times.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Let's see: 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers), 101-200: 180-189 (10), 201-300: 280-289 (10), 301-400: 380-389 (10). That's four blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Now, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 8 would be from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 more. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1-400, we have four blocks of 10 numbers each where the tens digit is 8, contributing 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, yes, 40 + 9 = 49. Okay.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units place (48) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 48 + 49 = 97.\n\nWait, let me confirm that again. Units place: 48, tens place:49, so total 97 8's. \n\nSo, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 187 - 97 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me double-check the counts.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 times)\n- Tens: 50 (40 from the first four hundreds, 10 from 440-449)\n- Hundreds: 89 (400-488)\nTotal: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 times)\n- Tens: 49 (40 from the first four hundreds, 9 from 480-488)\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 48 + 49 = 97. That also seems correct.\n\nDifference: 187 - 97 = 90. So, yes, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** Every 10 numbers have one 4. There are 48 full sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 4's.\n- **Tens place:** Every 100 numbers have 10 4's in the tens place. From 1-400, there are four sets (40-49, 140-149, etc.), contributing 40 4's. Additionally, 440-449 adds 10 more, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, there are 89 numbers with 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** Similarly, 48 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** From 1-400, four sets (80-89, etc.) contribute 40 8's. From 401-488, 480-488 adds 9 more, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 48 + 49 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of ten consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place, and the same for 8. For example, from 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, 4 appears once, and 8 appears once. \n\nNow, how many such groups of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of ten and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in each of the 48 complete groups, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. That gives 48 times each. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once and 8 appears once here as well. Therefore, in the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's, so 49 each. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nNext, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). In each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers: 40-49. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in 80-89. So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers.\n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each of the 4 complete hundreds, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so that's 4*10 = 40 times. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times per hundred, so 4*10 = 40 times. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 401-488. So, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place here. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. Hmm, so in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in 480-488. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. The tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, that's 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's 9 numbers. Therefore, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in the last partial hundred. So, total in the tens place for 488 pages: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50 times for 4's. For 8's, it's 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49 times. So, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times, so the difference here is 1 more 4 than 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, 400-488 is the fifth hundred, but let me check: 1-99 is 1-99, 100-199 is 100-199, 200-299 is 200-299, 300-399 is 300-399, and 400-488 is 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 1,2,3,4, but 4 only goes up to 488, not 499. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). \n\nSo, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the highest page is 488, so the hundreds digit is 4, not 8. Therefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times and 8 appears 0 times. So, the difference here is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts from each digit position.\n\nUnits place:\n- 4's: 49\n- 8's: 49\nDifference: 0\n\nTens place:\n- 4's: 50\n- 8's: 49\nDifference: +1\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\nDifference: +89\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nFirst, units place: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the units digit. Each ten has one 4 and one 8. There are 48 full tens (since 488 /10 = 48.8), so 48 times each, and then in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So, total units place: 48 +1 =49 for both 4 and 8. So, units place difference is 0.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens digit. So, 4 complete hundreds (1-400) give 4*10=40 each. Then, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, in 401-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, total tens place: 40 +10=50 for 4's, and 40 +9=49 for 8's. So, difference of +1.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, difference of +89.\n\nAdding up the differences: 0 (units) +1 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =90.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the hundreds place again. From 1-99, hundreds digit is 0 or 1? Wait, no, page numbers start at 1, so 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit, but when considering three-digit numbers, pages 100-999 have hundreds digits. So, in our case, pages 1-99 are one or two digits, so the hundreds digit is 0, but we don't count leading zeros, so the hundreds digit only exists from 100 onwards. So, from 100-199, hundreds digit is 1; 200-299 is 2; 300-399 is 3; 400-488 is 4. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to calculate the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. So, 488 -400 +1 =89 pages. So, 89 times 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up, the total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nTotal number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) =49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference per digit place was 0, +1, +89, totaling 90. So, that's consistent.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can calculate the total number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract.\n\nCalculating total 4's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, plus the last 8 numbers where 4 appears once. So, 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, plus in the last partial hundred (401-488), 440-449 is 10. So, 4*10 +10=50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n\nUnits place: same as 4's, 49.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds, 4*10=40, plus in the last partial hundred, 480-488 is 9, so 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I didn't miss any cases. For example, in the units place, when considering 488, the last number is 488, so units digits go up to 8. So, in the last partial ten, 481-488, units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So, that's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digits go up to 8 (480-488). So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, adding up, the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. We analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each ten numbers (e.g., 1-10) have one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 complete groups of ten, contributing 48 each.\n   - The last 8 numbers (481-488) add one 4 and one 8.\n   - Total 4's: 49, Total 8's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8.\n   - 4 complete hundreds contribute 40 each.\n   - In 401-488, 440-449 adds 10 4's, and 480-488 adds 9 8's.\n   - Total 4's: 50, Total 8's: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89, Total 8's: 0.\n\nSumming up:\n- Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- Total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I think this approach will help me avoid missing any numbers. \n\nFirst, for the units place. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the units place and how many times 8 appears there. \n\nFor the units digit, in every block of 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once. So, for example, in 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. \n\nNow, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). \n\nWait, actually, 488 is the last page, so the units digit cycles every 10. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 times 1 (since each block contributes one 4) plus any additional 4's in the partial block. Similarly for 8's.\n\nWait, let me think again. The total number of units digits from 1 to 488 is 488. Each digit 0-9 appears equally in the units place. So, how many times does each digit appear? Well, for the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears floor(488/10) = 48 times, and then there's a remainder of 8 pages (since 48*10=480, so 480+8=488). So, the digits 1-8 appear one more time each in the units place. So, the digit 4 appears 48 times plus one more time in the units place, making it 49. Similarly, 8 appears 48 times plus one more time, making it 49 as well. Wait, that can't be right because the last page is 488, so the units digit is 8, so yes, 8 gets an extra count. But 4's units digit would only go up to 484, which is 480 +4, so 484 is the last 4 in the units place before 488. So, maybe I was correct the first time, that 4 appears 48 times in the units place, and 8 appears 48 times plus one more, making it 49. Wait, no, because from 1 to 480, each digit 0-9 appears exactly 48 times in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once more (at 484), and 8 appears once more (at 488). So, total for units place: 4 appears 48 +1 =49 times, and 8 appears 48 +1=49 times. So, in the units place, they are equal. \n\nWait, but 488 is included, so from 1 to 488, the units digits for 4 and 8 each have 49 occurrences. So, that's 49 each in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. Similarly, I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every block of 100. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each block of 100, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times as well.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488? There are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then a partial block from 401-488.\n\nSo, for each complete block, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times. So, for 4 blocks, that's 4*10=40 times for 4, and 4*10=40 times for 8.\n\nNow, the partial block from 401-488. Let's see, the tens digit here ranges from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). Wait, no, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So, in the tens place, for 401-488, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see: 440-449 would be when the tens digit is 4. But wait, 401-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Similarly, 480-488 would have the tens digit as 8 for 480-488, but wait, 480 is 480, 481, ..., 488, so that's 9 numbers, right? Because 480 is included, so from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. Wait, no, 480 has a tens digit of 8? Wait, 480 is 4 8 0, so yes, the tens digit is 8. So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8.\n\nWait, but 401-488: the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for the tens digit being 4, it's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. For the tens digit being 8, it's from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nSo, in the partial block, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nTherefore, total in the tens place: 4 appears 40 (from complete blocks) +10=50 times, and 8 appears 40 +9=49 times.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. From 1-400, each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place (4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10 times). Then, from 401-488, the tens digits go up to 8. So, for 4 in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. For 8 in the tens place, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, total for tens place: 4 appears 40+10=50 times, and 8 appears 40+9=49 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. How many times does 4 and 8 appear here?\n\nIn the hundreds place, each digit from 1 to 4 appears in the hundreds place for 100 numbers each. For example, 100-199 have 1 in the hundreds place, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, for 4 in the hundreds place, it's from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nFor 8 in the hundreds place, since the book only goes up to 488, there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, that seems correct because the hundreds digit can only be 1,2,3,4 in this case, and 8 would require pages from 800-899, which are beyond 488. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all.\n\nSo, total in the hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences.\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89 = 188 times.\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's: 49 +49 +0 = 98 times.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high, but let me check my calculations again.\n\nFirst, units place:\n- 4's: 49\n- 8's:49\n\nTens place:\n- 4's:50\n- 8's:49\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's:89\n- 8's:0\n\nSo, 4's total:49+50+89=188\n8's total:49+49+0=98\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the counts, especially in the tens and units places.\n\nStarting with units place: from 1 to 488, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times, plus an extra 8 digits (1-8) in the last partial block, so 48+1=49 for 4 and 8 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each block of 100 contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place. So, 4 blocks contribute 40 times each. Then, in the partial block (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (440-449) and 8 for 9 numbers (480-488). So, 40+10=50 for 4, and 40+9=49 for 8. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. 8 doesn't appear at all in the hundreds place, so 0 times. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's total 188, 8's total 98, difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Break Down by Digit Places:**\n   - Consider units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n2. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears equally in the units place.\n   - Total numbers: 488.\n   - Each digit appears floor(488/10) = 48 times.\n   - Remainder: 8 numbers (481-488) add one more occurrence for digits 1-8.\n   - **4's:** 48 +1 = 49.\n   - **8's:** 48 +1 = 49.\n\n3. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times per block of 100.\n   - Complete blocks: 4 (1-400), contributing 40 times each.\n   - Partial block (401-488):\n     - **4's:** 10 times (440-449).\n     - **8's:** 9 times (480-488).\n   - **4's:** 40 +10 = 50.\n   - **8's:** 40 +9 = 49.\n\n4. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Digits range from 1-4.\n   - **4's:** 89 times (400-488).\n   - **8's:** 0 times.\n\n5. **Total Counts:**\n   - **4's:** 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **8's:** 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n6. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll go through each place one by one for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place**: For every group of ten numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. How many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of ten, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 fours. But wait, the last group is from 481 to 490, but since the book only goes up to 488, the units digit 4 appears in 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. Wait, no, in the units place, it's only 484. So actually, each full ten contributes one, so 48 times, plus the 484, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, because 488 is less than 490, so the units digit 4 in 484 is the 49th occurrence. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then an additional 4 in 484, making it 49 times. But wait, let me check that. From 1 to 480, there are 480 numbers, which is 48 groups of ten, so 48 fours in the units place. Then from 481 to 488, the next group is 481-490, but we only go up to 488. In this range, the units digit 4 appears in 484, so that's one more. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place**: Now, for the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of ten numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes ten 4's in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the blocks are:\n\n   - 40-49: 10 numbers\n   - 140-149: 10 numbers\n   - 240-249: 10 numbers\n   - 340-349: 10 numbers\n   - 440-449: 10 numbers\n\n   Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: Now, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, 99 + 89 is 188? Wait, 99 + 80 is 179, plus 9 is 188. Hmm, but let me double-check that addition. 49 + 50 is 99, yes. 99 + 89: 99 + 80 is 179, plus 9 is 188. So total fours: 188.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place**: Similarly, in the units place, the digit 8 appears once every ten numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's see, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last one is 488, which is the units digit 8 in 488. So how many such numbers? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, and then the 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So units place 8's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place**: For the tens place, the digit 8 appears in blocks of ten numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many full blocks there are:\n\n   - 80-89: 10 numbers\n   - 180-189: 10 numbers\n   - 280-289: 10 numbers\n   - 380-389: 10 numbers\n   - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\n   So, the first four blocks are full, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, and the last block contributes 9 eights. So total tens place 8's: (4 * 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: Now, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check the tens place for 8. The blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (480,481,...,488). Wait, no, actually, in the tens place, 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers. So from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So that's 9 eights. So total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49, as I had before.\n\nSo total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nNow, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems.\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Units place: 49. Let me count how many times 4 appears in the units place. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial ten, 481-488, the units digit 4 is in 484, so that's one more, making it 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 5 blocks of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89. Correct.\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units place: Similarly, 49 times. From 8,18,...,488. 488 is included, so 49 times. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 5 blocks, but the last block is only up to 488, so 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 eights, and the last block 480-488 contributing 9 eights. So 4*10 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: None, since the book ends at 488. Correct.\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly for fours? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So 89 fours in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place, 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Correct.\n\nUnits place, 49. So 89 + 50 = 139, plus 49 is 188. Correct.\n\nFor eights, units and tens each have 49, so 98. So 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When counting the hundreds place for fours, from 400 to 488, that's correct. But let me make sure that in the hundreds place, 400-488 is indeed 89 numbers. 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. Correct.\n\nAnother way to check: Let's calculate the total number of digits used and see if it makes sense, but that might be overkill. Alternatively, maybe I can think of how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the number of times 4 appears in each position:\n\nUnits place: For each digit from 0-9, in the units place, each digit appears equally often except possibly the last partial group. So for 488 numbers, units digit cycles every 10. So 488 / 10 = 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus the remainder. 488 mod 10 is 8, so in the units place, the digits go from 0 to 8 in the last partial cycle. So 4 appears once more in the units place, making it 49. Correct.\n\nTens place: Similarly, for the tens digit, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each block of 100. So for 488 pages, how many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. Each full hundred contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So 4 hundreds * 10 = 40 fours in the tens place. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So in 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but we only go up to 488). So in the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, no, 401-488: the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's 10 more fours in the tens place. So total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: As before, 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89. Correct.\n\nSo total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor eights:\n\nUnits place: Same logic, 488 / 10 = 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, plus the last partial cycle where 8 appears once (in 488). So 49. Correct.\n\nTens place: Each full hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So 4 hundreds * 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: None, as before. So total eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I think this approach will make it easier to count each occurrence without missing any. \n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 appears once as well. Wait, but from 1 to 10, 8 appears in 8, and 4 appears in 4. So, each cycle of 10 has one 4 and one 8 in the units place. \n\nBut wait, the book has 488 pages, which is 48 full sets of 10 (since 48*10=480) and then 8 more pages (481 to 488). So, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 times 1 (from each set of 10) plus any additional in the last 8 pages. Let me check: from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, there's a 4 in 484, which is one more. So, total 4's in units place would be 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, the number of 8's in the units place would be 48 times 1 plus one more in 488, so 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that's the same number, so maybe in the units place, 4's and 8's appear equally. Hmm, but let me check that again because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, no, from 1 to 480, each set of 10 has one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 sets would give 48 4's and 48 8's. Then, from 481 to 488, as I saw, 484 has a 4 in the units place, and 488 has an 8. So, that adds one more 4 and one more 8. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. So, same number. So, in the units place, 4's and 8's are equal. So, no difference there.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each set of 100 pages has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (like 40-49) and 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (like 80-89). So, in each 100-page block, there are 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. Now, how many full 100-page blocks are there in 488 pages? Let's see, 488 divided by 100 is 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages left (401-488). \n\nSo, for each of the 4 full blocks, we have 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, that's 4*10 = 40 4's and 4*10 = 40 8's. Now, let's check the remaining 88 pages, from 401 to 488. The tens digit in these pages goes from 0 to 8. Let's see, in 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, it's 1; 421-430, it's 2; 431-440, it's 3; 441-450, it's 4; 451-460, it's 5; 461-470, it's 6; 471-480, it's 7; and 481-488, it's 8. \n\nSo, in the tens place, within 401-488, how many times does 4 appear? It appears in 441-450, which is 10 times. And how about 8? It appears in 481-488, but wait, 481-488 is only 8 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, that's 8 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in 481-488. Wait, but actually, the tens digit in 481 is 8, and in 482 it's 8, up to 488, which is 8 times. So, in the tens place, in the last partial block, 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). \n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place: 4*10 (from full blocks) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50. And 8's in the tens place: 4*10 + 8 = 48. So, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 48 times. So, that's a difference of 2 more 4's than 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me double-check. Each 100-page block has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 blocks would give 40 each. Then, in the last partial block, 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 times. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's: 40 + 8 = 48. So, yes, that's correct. So, in the tens place, 4's are 50, 8's are 48, so 4's are 2 more.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. How about 8? Well, in the hundreds place, 8 would appear in pages 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0 times. So, in the hundreds place, 4's are 89, and 8's are 0, so that's a difference of 89 more 4's than 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts from each digit place.\n\nUnits place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49. Difference: 0.\n\nTens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 48. Difference: +2.\n\nHundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0. Difference: +89.\n\nSo, total difference: 0 + 2 + 89 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 488 pages. Each 10 pages have one 4 and one 8 in units place. So, 48 full sets of 10, which is 48*10=480 pages. Then, 481-488 is 8 pages. In units place, 481 has 1, 482 has 2, ..., 484 has 4, 485 has 5, 486 has 6, 487 has 7, 488 has 8. So, in the last 8 pages, units digit 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 4's = 48 + 1 = 49, 8's = 48 +1 =49. Correct.\n\nTens place: Each 100 pages have 10 4's and 10 8's in tens place. So, 4 full hundreds: 4*10=40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 times. So, 4's: 40 +10=50, 8's:40 +8=48. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 times. 8 doesn't appear in hundreds place. So, 4's:89, 8's:0. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =97.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -97=91. So, 4's are printed 91 more times than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can calculate the total number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract.\n\nTotal number of 4's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full cycles (48*10=480 pages) give 48 4's. Then, in 481-488, 484 has a 4, so +1. Total:49.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds give 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, 441-450 gives 10 more. So, total 50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 gives 89. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal number of 8's:\n\nUnits place:48 full cycles give 48, plus 488 gives +1. Total:49.\n\nTens place:4 full hundreds give 4*10=40, plus 481-488 gives 8. So, total 48.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+48=97.\n\nSo, 188-97=91. So, yes, 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 91.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each set of 10 pages (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) has one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n   - There are 48 full sets of 10 pages in 480 pages, contributing 48 4's and 48 8's.\n   - Pages 481-488 add one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488).\n   - **Total 4's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n   - **Total 8's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each set of 100 pages has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - Four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) contribute 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - Pages 401-488: The tens digit 4 appears in 441-450 (10 times), and 8 appears in 481-488 (8 times).\n   - **Total 4's in tens place:** 40 + 10 = 50\n   - **Total 8's in tens place:** 40 + 8 = 48\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in pages 400-488, which is 89 times.\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at page 488.\n   - **Total 4's in hundreds place:** 89\n   - **Total 8's in hundreds place:** 0\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{91}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears once. How many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, we'll take the integer part, which is 48. So, that gives 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place. But wait, I think I might be missing the last partial set. Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, in the units place, from 1 to 488, the digit 4 appears 48 times plus one more time in the 480-488 range, specifically at 484. So, that makes 49 times in the units place.\n\nWait, no, actually, the remainder is 8, so the units digit cycles up to 8, meaning 484 is included, so yes, 48 full tens plus one more 4 in the units place. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, from 100-199, the tens digit is 4 for 140-149, another 10 times. This pattern continues for each hundred. How many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 full hundreds. So, each hundred contributes 10 times the digit 4 in the tens place, so 4 times 10 is 40. But wait, we also have the last partial hundred from 400-488. In this range, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is another 10 times. So, that's 4 full hundreds (40) plus 10, making a total of 50 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. From 1-99: 40-49 (10 times). 100-199: 140-149 (10). 200-299: 240-249 (10). 300-399: 340-349 (10). 400-488: 440-449 (10). So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. So, yes, 50 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times. Wait, no, that's not right because each number in 400-488 has 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 numbers. But wait, I think I made a mistake here because the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 400 is included, so 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89). Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. But wait, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so does 488 include an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with an 8, so that's one more. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The common difference is 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, yes, 49 times in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 times, except the last one, which might be less if the book doesn't go up to 489. Wait, the book goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n- 180-189: 10 times.\n- 280-289: 10 times.\n- 380-389: 10 times.\n- 480-488: 9 times (since 488 is the last page).\n\nSo, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check: From 1-99, the tens digit is 8 for 80-89, which is 10 times. Then 100-199: 180-189, another 10. 200-299: 280-289, 10. 300-399: 380-389, 10. Then 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, yes, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nSo, 49 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the hundreds place contributes 0 times.\n\nTherefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 times.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The hundreds digit can't be 8 because the book ends at 488, which is less than 800. So, yes, 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, for the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49 times.\n- Tens place: 50 times.\n- Hundreds place: 89 times.\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49 times.\n- Tens place: 49 times.\n- Hundreds place: 0 times.\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of 10, contributing 48 occurrences. Additionally, in the range 480-488, 484 has a 4 in the units place, adding 1 more. Total: 49.\n   \n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 5 such sets (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), each contributing 10 occurrences. Total: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. Total: 89.\n\nAdding these, the digit 4 appears 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets, contributing 48 occurrences. Additionally, 488 has an 8 in the units place, adding 1 more. Total: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are 4 full sets (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 occurrences, and in the range 400-488, 480-488 contributes 9 occurrences. Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488. Total: 0.\n\nAdding these, the digit 8 appears 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll handle each position for both 4 and 8 and sum them up.\n\nFirst, for the units place. In the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each set of ten numbers. For example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, each digit appears once in the units place every ten numbers. Now, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). \n\nWait, actually, maybe a better way is to think about it as 488 pages, so the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, the number of times each digit appears in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48 times for each digit, and then for the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in the remaining 8 pages, the digits 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 each appear once, and 0 doesn't appear here because 480 is already included in the 48 sets. So, for the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times from the complete sets, plus 1 more from the remaining 8 pages, totaling 49 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 48 times from the complete sets, plus 1 more from the remaining 8 pages, totaling 49 times as well. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. So, the difference here is zero. \n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 1 to 480, that's 480 pages, which is 48 sets of 10. So, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 48 times in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, that's 8 pages, so the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, each of these digits appears once more. So, for 4, it's 48 + 1 = 49, and for 8, it's also 48 + 1 = 49. So, yes, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. So, no difference here.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), etc., up to 9 (90-99). So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for every 100 numbers. \n\nNow, since the book has 488 pages, let's break it down into hundreds. The first 100 pages (1-100), the next 100 (101-200), then 201-300, 301-400, and finally 401-488. \n\nSo, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for 1-100, the tens digits go from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Then, 101-200: the tens digits again go from 0 (101-109) to 9 (190-199), and so on.\n\nSo, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, same for 8. Now, how many complete hundreds do we have? Well, 488 is less than 500, so we have four complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Then, the remaining pages are 401-488, which is 88 pages.\n\nSo, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so that's 4*10 = 40 times for 4. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times in each hundred, so 4*10 = 40 times for 8.\n\nNow, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), let's see how the tens digit behaves. The tens digit in 401-488 goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490), but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, how many times does the digit 4 appear in the tens place in 401-488? Let's see, the tens digit 4 would be in 440-449, which is 10 pages. But wait, 488 is only up to 488, so 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in the remaining 88 pages. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages? Wait, no, 480 is the start, but 480-489 would be 10 pages, but we only have up to 488, so it's 9 pages? Wait, no, 480 is included, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 pages (480,481,...,488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, so in 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 pages. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the remaining 88 pages.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, for the tens digit 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in the remaining 88 pages. For the digit 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages, so the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the remaining 88 pages.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 4*10 (from the four hundreds) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50 times. The digit 8 appears 4*10 (from the four hundreds) + 9 (from 401-488) = 49 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times, so the difference here is 1.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. For the four complete hundreds (1-400), each contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 for both. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. So, total for 4 is 40+10=50, and for 8 it's 40+9=49. So, yes, the difference in the tens place is 1.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, pages 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit, pages 100-199 have a hundreds digit of 1, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4. \n\nSo, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the digit 8 appears zero times in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, the difference here is 89.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing 1 for 4 and 1 for 8, so 48 each. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49 for both. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10 for 4 and 10 for 8. Four hundreds give 40 each. Then, in the last 88 pages, 440-449 gives 10 for 4, and 480-488 gives 9 for 8. So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 for 4, and 0 for 8 since 800+ isn't reached. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When I was counting the units place, I considered 481-488 as the last 8 pages, but actually, the last page is 488, so from 481 to 488 is 8 pages, right? So, units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, each of these digits appears once, so 4 and 8 each get one more in the units place. So, that part seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 pages. So, 89 times for 4, which is correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a way to cross-verify this? Maybe by considering the total number of digits used and seeing if the counts make sense.\n\nThe total number of pages is 488, so the total number of digits used is as follows:\n\n- Pages 1-9: 9 pages, 1 digit each, total 9 digits.\n- Pages 10-99: 90 pages, 2 digits each, total 180 digits.\n- Pages 100-488: 488 - 99 = 389 pages, 3 digits each, total 1167 digits.\n\nTotal digits: 9 + 180 + 1167 = 1356 digits.\n\nNow, the total number of digits should also be equal to the sum of all digits from 1 to 488. But I'm not sure if that helps directly, but maybe I can check the count of 4's and 8's.\n\nWait, but let's see: 188 4's and 98 8's. So, 188 - 98 = 90. That seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position again to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 488 pages: 488 / 10 = 48 full cycles, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8 in the units place. So, 48 each.\n- Remaining 8 pages (481-488): units digits 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once. So, 48 + 1 = 49 each.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 40 each.\n- Remaining 88 pages (401-488): tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. Tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. So, total 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 400-488: 89 pages, hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. 8 doesn't appear in hundreds place.\n\nSo, 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. I think I've double-checked each part, and the calculations seem correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, and hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place for the first 480 pages.\n   - Pages 481-488 add one more 4 and one more 8.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's.\n   - Four complete hundreds (1-400) give 40 each.\n   - Pages 401-488 add 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 contribute 89 4's.\n   - No 8's appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each position in the page numbers separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\nFirst, for the units place. In every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 pages. Each complete block contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the partial block from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which adds one more 4. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. Here, the digit 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers, specifically from 40 to 49, 140 to 149, etc. Each of these blocks contributes 10 instances of the digit 4 in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block from 401 to 488. Each complete block gives 10 4's, so 4*10 = 40. Now, in the partial block from 401 to 488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-409, then 4 for 410-419, but wait, 410-419 would be part of the next block. Wait, actually, from 401 to 488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-409, 1 for 410-419, 2 for 420-429, ..., up to 8 for 480-488. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. The tens digit is determined by the second digit. So, for 401-409, the tens digit is 0. For 410-419, it's 1. For 420-429, it's 2, and so on up to 480-488, where the tens digit is 8. But in this range, when does the tens digit become 4? It would be in 440-449. So, from 401 to 488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 more 4's. So, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but wait, 401-488 is actually 88 pages, right? So, 401 to 488 is 88 pages. So, how does that affect the count? Let me correct that. From 1 to 488, the number of times the tens digit is 4 is in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers, so that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's included. So, total 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought of 4 complete blocks (each 100 pages) giving 4*10=40, and then the partial block giving another 10, so total 50. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (including both 400 and 488). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's: units place 49, tens place 50, hundreds place 89. Total 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Yes.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with the units place. In every block of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the partial block from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 is included, which adds one more 8. So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there? From 1 to 488, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 5 blocks. Each contributes 10 8's except the last one, which is only 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears in 480-488 as the tens digit for 480-488. Wait, but 480 has 8 in the tens place, 481 has 8, up to 488. So, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, for the tens place, each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 8's, so 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, contributes 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. From 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's. Similarly, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4*10=40. Then, 480-488: 480,481,...,488. The tens digit is 8 in all these, so that's 9 numbers, hence 9 8's. So, total 40 +9=49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds place 0. Total 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier I thought the 8's in the tens place would be 49, but let me check again. Wait, units place was 49, tens place 49, so total 98 8's. But wait, let me recount the tens place because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, in the tens place, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the 8's in the tens place would be 49, which is correct. So, total 8's are 98.\n\nWait, but earlier when I calculated 4's, I got 188, and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to miscount, especially with the ranges.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\nUnits place: From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place. So, 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, the last partial ten is 481-488, which includes 484, so one more 4. So, 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, total 4's: 49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nUnits place: Similarly, every 10 numbers contribute one 8, so 48 full tens, 48 8's, plus the last partial ten (481-488) includes 488, so one more 8. So, 49. Correct.\n\nTens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: No 8's, as the book ends at 488. So, 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count the 4's correctly in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to calculate the number of times a digit appears is to consider each digit position separately and calculate how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor example, for the units digit, in numbers from 1 to N, the number of times a digit d appears is floor(N/10)*1 + extra if the remainder is >=d.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use a more formulaic approach to avoid mistakes.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFor the units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's = floor(488/10)*1 + (if the remainder >=4, add 1 else 0). So, 488/10=48.8, floor is 48, remainder is 8. Since 8 >=4, add 1. So, 48+1=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in units place: floor(488/10)=48, remainder=8. Since 8>=8, add 1. So, 48+1=49. Correct.\n\nFor the tens digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: We can calculate this as follows. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (40-49, 140-149, etc.). The number of complete hundreds in 488 is 4 (since 4*100=400). So, 4*10=40. Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40+10=50. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (80-89, 180-189, etc.). Number of complete hundreds is 4, so 4*10=40. In the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49. Correct.\n\nFor the hundreds digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 4's. Correct.\n\nNumber of 8's: The hundreds digit is 8 from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are 0 8's in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds digit for 4's would be 89, but let me confirm that. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1=89 numbers. So, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens digit, the 4's in 440-449 are 10 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the 8's in the tens place. From 480-488, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place? The numbers are 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, 9 8's in the tens place from 480-488.\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place: 40 (from the four complete hundreds) +9=49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because I might have miscounted somewhere. Let me try another approach to verify.\n\nAnother way to calculate the number of times a digit appears is to consider each digit position separately and calculate the number of times each digit appears in that position.\n\nFor the units digit:\n\nFor each digit d from 0 to 9, the number of times it appears in the units place from 1 to N is given by:\n\ncount = (N // 10) * 1 + min(max(N % 10 - d +1, 0), 1) if d !=0 else (N //10) +1.\n\nWait, but maybe a simpler way is:\n\nFor units digit, the number of times digit d appears is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) times 1, plus 1 if the remainder is >=d.\n\nSo, for d=4, N=488:\n\ncomplete decades = 488 //10 =48.\n\nremainder =488 %10=8.\n\nSince 8>=4, add 1. So, 48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8:\n\ncomplete decades=48.\n\nremainder=8.\n\nSince 8>=8, add 1. So, 48+1=49.\n\nFor the tens digit:\n\nThe number of times digit d appears in the tens place is calculated by:\n\ncount = (N // 100) *10 + extra.\n\nWhere extra is determined by the last two digits.\n\nIf the last two digits are >=d*10 +9, then add (last two digits - d*10 +1). Otherwise, add 0.\n\nWait, perhaps an example would help.\n\nFor d=4 in the tens place:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds =488 //100=4.\n\nEach complete hundred contributes 10 times the digit 4 in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 4*10=40.\n\nNow, the last partial hundred is from 400 to 488.\n\nIn the last partial hundred, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, extra=10.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place=40+10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8 in the tens place:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds=4.\n\nEach contributes 10 times 8 in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nIn the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, extra=9.\n\nThus, total 8's in tens place=40+9=49.\n\nFor the hundreds digit:\n\nFor d=4, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nFor d=8, there are no numbers from 800-899, so 0.\n\nThus, total 4's:49 (units)+50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, this confirms my earlier calculation. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
